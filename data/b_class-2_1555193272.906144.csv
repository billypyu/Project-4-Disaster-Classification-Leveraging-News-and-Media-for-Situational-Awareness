Josh Constine,"Microbiome therapeutics, Photoshop for augmented reality, and cancer treatments were some of the ideas presented at Day 2 of startup accelerator Y Combinator’s Winter 2018 Demo Day. YC is increasingly using its massive class size (141 startups this time around) to fund especially risky frontier technology and biotech moonshots, while tempering the portfolio with more predictable enterprise companies. The accelerator still admits many international copycats of U.S. successes, and YC is also repeating itself a bit. The Podcast App pitched the exact same product and strategy as Breaker, which debuted at YC exactly a year ago. But there were plenty of ambitious and unique businesses unveiled today on the Mountain View Computer History Museum stage, and the room was — as always — packed with a who’s who of tech investors. Check out our coverage of all 64 startups that launched on the record yesterday, plus our picks for the top 7 companies from yesterday. (Tomorrow morning we’ll have our favorites from today.) Here are the 60+ startups that launched at YC’s Winter 2018 Demo Day 2: Callisto Callisto is a sexual misconduct reporting software built for victims.

If two victims name the same perpetrator, they are put in touch with each other and then with with an “options counselor,” a lawyer who can give them options on how to proceed in handling the situation. The company says that victims that visit Callisto’s website are 5x more likely to take action. They’ve started by rolling out their product on college campuses and are now taking donation from investors to roll out the service to the startup community.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/ robot dog from burning my house down ?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with spring water, here are the steps you should follow to properly extinguish a battery-related fire (and why you should save that Pellegrino as a last resort). Smartphone Fire? Unplug It First A smartphone battery fire is only made worse if that smartphone is drawing on another power source while it burns. When your battery starts to hiss or bulge, be sure to unplug it from whatever power source it’s connected to before you turn your attention to extinguishing. Start With a Fire Extinguisher Safety first means being prepared for emergencies like fires, caused by your smartphone’s self-immolating battery or otherwise. That means you’ll need a fire extinguisher, so add one to your shopping list. In terms of fire extinguishers, you should have one designed to put out Class B and Class C fires. Class B fires involve flammable liquids and gases, while Class C fires involve electrical equipment like motors and batteries. Your standard fire extinguisher, costing anywhere from $35 to $80, should be able to handle Class A, B, and C fires. There are a variety of extinguishers available, but searching for a Class ABC extinguisher will yield one appropriate for dowsing your new Pixel 2. If you’re on a budget, you can snag smaller fire suppression canisters that are both cheaper (anywhere from $20 to $40) and smaller than a standard fire extinguisher. In late December, Galaxy Note 8 owners started to report a bizarre issue with the phone’s battery.… Read more Read Class D fire extinguishers are also available, but are designed to extinguish fires involving combustible metals. While you can certainly use one to put out your smartphone, a class D fire extinguisher’s high price tag might put it a bit out of your reach, so don’t bother spending the hundreds of dollars required to get one. Water or Sand Works in a Pinch Thanks to the chemical composition of smartphones powered by lithium batteries, there is always the chance that pouring water on a smartphone could cause a chemical reaction between the H2O and lithium metal, turning that hydrogen into fuel for the fire. Fortunately, most smartphone batteries have such little lithium the risk is pretty negligible. Should you find yourself dealing with a smartphone fire armed only with a six-pack of seltzer, feel free to apply it liberally, and drown your smartphone until no more smoke is visible. Needless to say, your phone is toast. You can dispose of your charred battery by searching for a battery disposal location near you. If your iPhone decides to blow up at the beach, you can also cover it in sand or other non-flammable smothering agent like dirt. As with most things that burn, be sure to avoid inhaling the fumes from a smoking battery, as they’re toxic, carcinogenic, and just plain gross.","After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/robot dog from burning my house down?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with…",2018-01-15T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How to Extinguish a Battery Fire,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-extinguish-a-battery-fire-1822040010,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--GAb-KedI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/glkvfwub9nefofh69zoj.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,class-2,1
Adam Rosenberg,"There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news. Bungie dusted off and updated a fresh batch exotic gear from the first Destiny, and will be adding it all to the Destiny 2 loot pool with the release of the May 8 expansion. In all, there are seven returning exotics that we know of. SEE ALSO: 'Destiny 2' gets Warmind and a major update this week. Here's the deal. Because I'm a monster, I decided to rank them. It's mostly armor, so your own ranking is probably super different, and entirely dependent on which class you prefer to play. Personally, I think Warlocks are a trash character class with a trash jump, and you'll see that reflected here. All of which is to say: Please enjoy my 100 percent scientific, completely official, and impossible to argue ranking of Warmind 's returning Destiny exotics. (Note: This ranking assumes all of this returning gear works just like it did in the original Destiny. I might re-rank them after Warmind is out and all secrets are revealed. But this is really just for fun, folks. Don't have a cow.) 7. Suros Regime Image: bungie Look. Any serious Destiny fan knows that Suros is actually #1 here. It's the only weapon in this lineup, for one. But more than that: It's freaking Suros Regime. One of the best weapons in the original game. Not only can it heal you as it deals damage, the bottom half of its magazine also deals bonus damage. For some Destiny players, this is the only exotic they ever used. Suros gets the bottom-rung nod mostly because it's the only weapon here, and it's always fun to start these dumb lists with a curveball. Or hey, let's say it's because the gun is blue now. Sure. That works. Suros is blue and that's bad. 6. Claws of Ahamkara Image: bungie As we've already discussed, Warlocks are trash. They're better in Destiny 2, sure, but their jump still sucks. The Claws of Ahamkara are a Warlock exotic, so instant demerit there. They also come with a fairly useless ability, which is a real problem for a class of gear that's supposed to make you feel powerful. Equip the Claws and you can charge up to two melee attacks instead of the usual one. It's the height of meh. Let's also not overlook the physical makeup of this thing you've willingly chosen to equip. It's basically a bunch of golden feathers protruding from your wrist, with all of them held in place by what appears to be a snap-on leather BDSM restraint. It's... different! But it's not going to up your Destiny 2 game. Sorry Claws of Ahamkara, you lose. 5. Apotheosis Veil Image: bungie Oh hey, look at that. Another Warlock exotic. Woopity scoop. Apotheosis Veil is somehow less useful than Claws of Ahamkara. It's got an exotic perk fully heals you and recharges your melee/grenade attacks whenever you activate your super. That's... nice. You really shouldn't be popping your super when you're at low health, though. Not unless you're wearing Apotheosis Veil, I guess. But why would you? There are better options. Looks alone give this one the edge over Claws of Ahamkara. What the hell is going on in there? Can our Warlock friend breathe? Is there some kind of cool space gas in there that activates your so-so exotic perk? Apotheosis Veil gives good screenshot, but little more than that. 4. Sealed Ahamkara Grasps Image: bungie Visually, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are a step up from the Claws' BDSM feathers. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these Hunter gauntlets. It's like someone polished and shaped a pile of fossils and glued it onto a sci-fi gauntlet. These rank higher than the Claws of Ahamkara largely because Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are not a Warlock exotic. The perk is also just provably better: You still get to charge up to two melee attacks, but you also have a chance of automatically reloading your weapon whenever you deal melee damage. It's almost as if Destiny itself is out to troll Warlocks. 3. Eternal Warrior Image: Bungie Eternal Warrior has one edge here over all the other exotics: It looks the coolest. It's a helmet that has its own face. What more do you need to know? It's also useful! Assuming it works the way its predecessor did, Titans get added damage resistance whenever their Fist of Havoc super is active. Eternal Warrior also makes Fist of Havoc last even longer. Most of all: It's not Warlock gear. Huge bonus for this (or any other) helmet. 2. Armamentarium Image: Bungie Armamentarium is what the Punisher would wear if he existed in the Destiny universe. Look at this thing. Those rows of bullets. The two breast grenades. A pair of Liefeld-ian pouches. This is an exotic for the Titan that is ready to go to war. It also happens to come with one of the most useful exotic perks in the game: Two grenades. It may not be as flashy as some of the others, but being able to store up as many as two grenade charges is never not useful in Destiny, especially for Titans, one of the most powerful grenade classes in the game. There are always things worth chucking grenades at in Destiny 2. 1. Fr0st-EE5 Image: bungie The Hunter is Destiny 2 's forgotten class, and that's a real shame for me, self-professed Hunter 4 Lyfe. But with the Fr0st-EE5 (pronounced ""frosteez"") coming back, that's all going to change. See all the tubes coming out of the boots in the image above? Those things charge up with power when you're sprinting around. That power then feeds into your abilities, speeding up your melee and grenade regeneration while you're running (you can also turn faster). Hey, you know what's terrible in Destiny 2 ? The recharge time on melee attacks and grenades. Bring on the Fr0st-EE5, baby. To lightly paraphrase what a wise Star Wars man once said: They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts. You can buy Destiny 2 here.","There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news.

The list of supported games is a bit short as of now, but that'll likely change pretty soon.

Jacob Kleinman,"If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way. A new class action lawsuit against the tech giant argues that it knew there was an issue with the device’s microphone and sold it as a premium smartphone anyway. After hearing this news, you may be wondering how to get involved in the lawsuit. Here’s what you need to know about the case, and what you should be doing right now if you bought a Pixel from Google. What’s the Case About? Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones suffer from what the company called a “hairline crack in the solder connection on the audio codec.” In some cases, this made it extremely difficult to use the microphone, making phone calls and voice commands impossible. The company says only 1% of Pixel phones included the defect, but the lawsuit notes that within just a few weeks of the device’s launch people were already reporting issues with the microphone. Instead of offering refunds, Google replaced some defective smartphones with new units that had the exact same issue. Even worse, the company never stopped selling the Pixel and Pixel XL despite mounting evidence that something was wrong. Can I Join the Lawsuit? If this all sounds familiar you probably qualify for the class action lawsuit, and even if you didn’t have any issue with your particular smartphone you should still qualify. According to the filing, the case covers “all individuals in the United States who purchased a Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone, other than for resale, between October 4, 2016 and the present.” The only exceptions are people directly connected to Google or the trial. That includes anyone working at Google, a Google subsidiary, or Google-affiliated company. It also rules out any judges assigned to the case, along with their immediate family. How to Get Involved For now, there’s not much you need to do. Just by buying a Pixel phone you’re included in the class action lawsuit. Once a trial is approved you’ll probably receive a notice in the mail telling you how to actively join the case. It will also explain how to file a claim once the lawsuit is settled— assuming there’s some money to be had. In the meantime, if you really want to get involved you can contact the law firm behind the case on their website. And if you’re feeling left out, the same firm is also looking for people who purchase the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL for a separate investigation into the screen burn-in issue that plagued both of those phones when they launched last fall. You can sign up for that case here.",If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way.

Emily Price,"Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging. Even more challenging is finding activities your child wants to do that for your family’s schedule. KidPass is a mobile app that works in major cities sort of like ClassPass does for gyms, except instead of pilates and yoga the events are all things like swimming lessons, art classes, and trips to the zoo. The idea is that you don’t have to sign up to commit to a particular activity without knowing if your child is going to like it, and you can do a variety of different things each month. So, you can try art lessons and if it’s a hit come back, or if it’s not, swap it out for karate or a trip to the museum the next week. Using the service requires a mobile app. A Basic plan is $49 a month and includes 10 “activity credits” that will translate into 2-3 activities during the month (some events require more credits than others). Super active parents can get 50 activity credits for $189 a month. Credits roll over from month to month for 90 days, so if you go on a vacation or just get busy one month you don’t lose them. The number of activity credits something takes varies. A swim class at the YMCA might set you back 3 credits in a month, while a music class with a smaller group might be 5. The subscription is month-to-month, so if you know things are about to get hectic or you’d rather sign up for that art class exclusively, you can bail. On a basic level, it can be a good resource for finding new things to check out near you, especially if you have a child who tends to like to try a variety of activities rather than just one, or your family has one of those schedules where another regular weekly commitment just won’t work.",Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging.

Devin Coldewey,"Tesla has paid out $5 million to settle a class action lawsuit against it alleging that the Autopilot feature in the company’s cars was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” Owners who paid $5,000 for Autopilot will be reimbursed to the tune of a couple hundred bucks, Reuters reported. Although Tesla claimed that the semi-autonomous driving software would improve safety and reduce the possibility of collisions, it was in practice erratic and unreliable. “Contrary to what Tesla represented to them, buyers of affected vehicles have become beta testers of half-baked software that renders Tesla vehicles dangerous if engaged.” A series of crashes that took place while Autopilot was active didn’t help dissuade anyone of that, though Tesla has maintained that the feature has improved safety overall. It also continued to update the system, bringing it closer to its original promise, but those improvements have taken a great deal more time than users were told to expect. Ultimately it was those delays in achieving the promised functionality that Tesla admitted were worth compensating the class members for. The settlement proposal was sent several weeks ago (and intercepted by Electrek ) and yesterday the plaintiffs filed documents saying they had agreed to it and as such would be dismissing the lawsuit as soon as the court permitted it. Consumers who paid for Autopilot before January 24, 2017 will receive $280, and the number decreases steadily the later people bought their cars or paid for the upgrade. The smallest amount is $20, hardly worth cashing in, but that’s the nature of class action suits. In a statement, Tesla emphasized its continual improvement of the Autopilot system, but acknowledged the need to pay back customers (including those outside the U.S., who technically aren’t part of the suit) for the inconvenience: Since rolling out our second generation of Autopilot hardware in October 2016, we have continued to provide software updates that have led to a major improvement in Autopilot functionality. That said, as time passed since we first unveiled Hardware 2, it eventually became clear that it was taking us longer to roll out these features than we would have liked or initially expected. We want to do right by those customers, so as part of a proposed settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit filed last year, we’ve agreed to compensate customers who purchased Autopilot on Hardware 2 vehicles who had to wait longer than we expected for these features. Although the settlement is specific to customers in the US, if it is approved by the court, we’ve decided to compensate all customers globally in the same way. There’s no legal obligation to do so, but it’s the right thing to do The settlement still has to be approved by the court, but there doesn’t appear to be any reason to think it won’t be.","Tesla has paid out $5 million to settle a class action lawsuit against it alleging that the Autopilot feature in the company’s cars was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” Owners who paid $5,000 for Autopilot will be reimbursed to the tune of a…",2018-05-25T17:26:39Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Tesla settles class action suit over Autopilot claims for $5M,http://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/tesla-settles-class-action-suit-over-autopilot-claims-for-5m/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/tesla-autopilot.jpg?w=599,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-2,1

Steve Dent,"It remains to be seen how effective that will be, but otherwise, the two laptops look like solid additions to Gigabyte's lineup. The Aero 15-Y9, now the company's flagship, packs an i9-8950HK 6-core chip, 15.6-inch 4K X-Rite Pantone certified panel, GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q graphics, up to 64 GB of RAM and two M.2 NVMe PCIe SSD slots.
The Aero 15-X9, has the same specs, but can also be equipped with an i7-8750H CPU and 15.6-inch 144Hz 1080p screen, on top of the i9 chip and 4K display option. The maximum supported GPU option for that model is the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU. Both laptops pack 94 Wh batteries, so the endurance should be at least as good as before. Weight around 4.4 pounds, including the battery and one M.2 SSD, so they're still among the lightest gaming laptops out there.
Interestingly, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has pulled out a Gigabyte laptop for the second CES in a row to talk about the company's laptop-class graphics.

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties. Because each attendee would often bring a case of whatever cheap lager they favored, I would often find my many bottles and cans of beer I didn’t really want to drink strewn across my apartment the next morning. (I mean, I drank it, but I wish I would have made some beer pickles too.) It’s Freshman Orientation Week at Lifehacker! This week, we’re covering ways to snap out of your summer haze and into an autumnal blitz of activity, whether you’re actually heading to campus for the first time, getting your own kids ready for school, or looking for ways to just be more productive in the classroom of life. So velcro up your Trapper Keepers, students. Class is now in session. You’re most likely already aware that beer makes a great deglazing liquid, but you may not be familiar with its pickling prowess. Using it to season and preserve vegetables is a great way to use up any beer you may not feel like drinking. (Just kidding. I know you guys always feel like drinking all the beer, but these pickles really are good.) The brine is simple enough—it’s beer, vinegar, salt and sugar, plus whatever other flavorful friends you want to add. I’ve used this brine to pickle both onions and corn, and both were delightfully sweet and sour and infused with just a touch of debauchery. To make it yourself, you will need: Your produce of choice—This amount of brine will cover one small onion, one large cucumber, or two ear’s worth of corn kernels. 3/4 cup white vinegar 1/2 cup beer (Pick your poison! I used an IPA this time but lagers and stouts are also tasty.) 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon salt 2 cloves of smashed garlic 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 1 bay leaf Cut your onions into slivers, slice your cucumbers, or remove your corn kernels from the cob. Place the prepared produce in a pint-sized mason jar or a soup container, and set it aside. If you want your pickles to have a kick, halve a jalapeño and throw that in there too. Add the remaining ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, pour the hot brine over the vegetables, cover them loosely, and let the liquid cool to room temperature. Pop your pickles in the fridge to cool overnight, then put them on sandwiches, sausages, and leftover pizza (for a very collegiate experience).","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties.

Rachel England,"The film, Vulture Club, is already in post-production. It stars Oscar-winning Susan Sarandon as an emergency room nurse whose son has been kidnapped by terrorists, and after being abandoned by the government, finds help in the unlikeliest of places. The thriller also stars Edie Falco of The Sopranos and Matt Bomer of Magic Mike, and is directed by Iranian-American Maryam Keshavarz, of Circumstance fame. Despite being slated for theatrical release, details on YouTube's plans to actually get the movie into theaters are scarce. Speaking to IndieWire, a rep from YouTube Red said, ""We don't have any news to report on a theatrical partner at this stage. Perhaps later once we identify a partner."" However, the move marks a significant strategy shift for the company. Just last year it made clear its intentions to focus on its online channel, telling IndieWire, "" Our distribution strategy for our original films and series is grounded on YouTube Red."" Vulture Club is certainly a different class of movie compared to YouTube Red's other recent acquisitions, Eminem's satirical hip-hop drama Bodied and Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me 2: Holy ChIcken! A gritty thriller featuring a mega star could well give YouTube Red the leg up it needs to rival the likes of Amazon Studios and be taken seriously in the process.","Following YouTube's announcement last month that it intends to spend ""hundreds of millions"" on original content for Red, it's just unveiled plans for a YouTube-made movie that'll also be released in theaters.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Zero exercise is not enough. Going for a walk every day is probably a good thing. And if you’re training for a marathon, you’ll be on your feet for a couple hours of hard workouts every week. But what is the benchmark for a human being just trying to squeeze enough healthy exercise into their life? Let’s break it down. It’s easy to feel motivated about the idea of exercising. Let’s all run marathons! And do a push-up … Read more Read Fortunately, all the major public health organizations are in agreement. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association are all on board with the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise like walking, ideally broken up into 30 minutes per day over five days 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise like running, ideally in three 25-minute chunks It only counts if you do 10 minutes or more in each session, and you should spread your sessions throughout the week (so, you can’t take a single 90-minute spinning class and figure you’re done.) If you’re a stroll-around-the-neighborhood person, go with the first recommendation. If you enjoy hard workouts, but would rather not change into your gym clothes every day, you can just go with the 75 minute recommendation. And feel free to mix and match. Here are some possibilities: Walk 15 minutes to and from work every week day (5 x 30 minutes = 150 moderate) Go running on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, each for 2-3 miles (3 x 25 minutes = 75 vigorous) Take a 90-minute heart-pounding cycling class, and go for a walk after dinner at least a few other days of the week (1 x 90 minutes = 90 vigorous, plus perhaps 3 x 15 = 45 moderate) Go for a 30-minute easy bike ride on Monday. Try a 45-minute water aerobics class on Wednesday. Take a short hike on Saturday. Mow the lawn for an hour on Saturday. (30 + 45 + 30 + 60 = 165 moderate) If you’re confused about what counts in each category, the UK’s National Health Service has a list of “moderate” and “vigorous” activities here. I love long walks and runs, but I tend to not too many of them for one reason: I get bored. Walking … Read more Read If you’re pretty athletic, the above won’t sound like much. Good news! The WHO has set a secondary goal for folks like you. It’s simple: just do double the above. So you can aim for 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity: Two of those killer 90-minute classes, Monday and Thursday A three-mile run every weekday An hour-long martial arts class three times a week...or, to meet the requirement with moderate activity, you can stroll for an hour before breakfast each day, the favorite activity of spunky grandmas and grandpas who will probably never die. (To be fair, the recommendations we’re talking about are for people up to age 65.) So, what about an upper limit? There isn’t one, from a public health point of view. More is better. (And even if you are doing less than the recommendations, anything is better than nothing.) That said, it is possible for you as an individual to do more exercise than your body is ready for. Don’t jump from a life of occasional strolling to a marathon training plan. And if you are on that marathon training plan and you’re feeling worn down, take a break already. Strength, Flexibility, and More So far we’ve been talking about aerobic exercise, which is the kind where you’re continuously moving (or, perhaps, doing quick work/rest intervals) and your heart rate is up. But there are other important forms of exercise, too. The WHO and other organizations recommend two days per week of “high intensity muscle strengthening activity,” which includes anything where you’re thinking in terms of sets and reps. (Three sets of eight to 10 reps is a good structure to start.) So, your workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps for this exercise, 3 sets of 8 after that, and—oh,… Read more Read That activity can be anything that challenges your muscles, and where the 10th rep is a lot harder than the first: lifting weights, or resistance band exercises, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups. So if you run three days per week but have time for more, don’t just fit in extra runs; try adding two days in the weight room instead. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends two other kinds of exercise you might otherwise forget: Two to three days per week that include stretching, ideally spending 60 seconds stretching each major muscle group. This can be in a few short stints of 10-30 seconds each. Two to three days per week that include neuromuscular training. Think of this as hand-eye coordination and its full-body equivalents. Anything involving balance, coordination, or paying attention to your gait fall into these categories. Both of these can fit into your other workouts. Stretching works well in a cool-down session after your main workout, or some people prefer to put it into a warm-up. If you’re doing functional movements like lunges that challenge your balance and coordination, you’re working on neuromuscular fitness.","Zero exercise is not enough.

Benji Jones,"For $1,995, a stationary bike from the exercise startup Peloton could be yours. Then after paying for delivery and setup ($250), essential equipment ($179), and a monthly membership fee ($39/mo) you'd be all good to go. 
 So, right, these bikes aren't cheap. 
 But that doesn't mean people aren't paying for them. Since launching in 2012, Peloton has sold more than 400,000 bikes and amassed more than a million members, which helps explain why the company is now worth an estimated $4 billion. 
 Peloton's recipe for success includes community and convenience. It's not like other popular cycling workouts, which typically involve classes at a studio. With Peloton, you can join thousands of other members for a studio-grade workout, all without leaving home. Just log into a class through a touch-screen tablet attached to the bike, and boom — you're cycling in a New York City studio with some of the nation's best spin instructors. 
 That sounds pretty ideal. High-intensity workouts. Good instructors. No cold morning walks to the gym. No attempts to look attractive in activewear. But are those alleged benefits really worth that high sticker price? 
 Over the course of two (very) long weeks in February, I set out to see whether the benefits are worth the sticker price. Every day, I took a 45-minute Peloton class from my 300-square-foot apartment. And to determine just how good of a workout I was getting, I did a before and after fitness assessment at the Sports Science Lab in Staten Island. 
 I documented the experience on camera, too. 
Peloton's equipment makes biking feel smooth and comfortable
 Yes, I had to rearrange the furniture in my small apartment to accommodate the bike. No, I will not complain about it. Peloton bikes are sleek and relatively easy to use, assuming you follow the ""Peloton 101"" tutorial, which is accessible through the monitor. It took a few days to feel snug in the seat, which is barely padded. But once I did — or once my butt grew numb, I'm not sure — biking felt smooth and comfortable. 
 The touch screen is basic, but does its job. It has a schedule of live classes and a library of recorded workouts. And there are tons of them. 
 Most frustrating is the audio especially if you get outraged when cords get caught on things. You have little choice but to use wireless headphones, as most cords aren't long enough. I used Apple AirPods, which worked well. 
Peloton instructors' motivational language didn't work for me
Peloton instructors are well-trained, but I found the language they use to motivate riders often irritating.
 Business Insider 
I've gone through training to become a spin teacher, so I feel slightly above average in my ability to critique instructors. But just slightly. I showed a few Peloton classes to Sean Kuechenmeister, a certified athletic trainer at the Sports Science Lab in Staten Island, to get an expert opinion. 
 Peloton instructors are strong cyclists and instructors. They have good form. They'll tell you to draw your shoulders away from your ears, which is good for avoiding injuries and tightness, Kuechenmeister said. And throughout the class, they'll cue you on beat to rise out of the saddle. 
 ""To avoid a lot of these overuse conditions, you need movement variability,"" he said. 
 Peloton instructors are also undeniably fit and attractive. In fact, they look far more like TV actors than indoor cyclists (which makes sense when you consider that there are thousands of riders watching them on what is, effectively, a television). 
 And that's actually what I find most irritating: Not their beauty, but their behavior. Much of the instruction feels like acting, or at least, it feels inauthentic. You'll hear phrases like ""Rise up out of the saddle, literally and metaphorically."" Or ""You're here to overcome your biggest obstacles,"" somehow by upping the resistance on your bike. 
 I'm all for creative forms of motivation; anything that encourages exercise is probably a good thing. But the language that Peloton instructors use makes me feel uncomfortable — especially because I'm riding from home, where it's hard to ignore the problems in my own life that a 45-minute spin class cannot, in fact, fix. 
Don't trust the bike's calorie count
Each Peloton bike might be calibrated differently, which can affect the calorie read-out on the bike's display.
 Business Insider 
Peloton claims that you can get a studio-grade workout from home, but I found that hard to believe. For a competitive person like me, riding in a studio next to dozens of other people is a great way to push myself. Plus, with thunderous club music, it offers a much-welcomed distraction from the pain of working out. 
 So I tested it out. For my eighth ride, I signed up for a live class at the Peloton studio in Chelsea, where the company films its classes. That's right, Peloton isn't just for the home. You can still take gym classes if that's more your speed. But if you like mixing it up between home and the gym, the calorie readouts might be different for different bikes. 
 While biking at home, for example, my independent heart monitor, strapped around my chest, indicated my average heart rate was around 145 beats per minute (BPM) per ride. And the Peloton display indicated that I was burning around 530 calories in that time, which is calculated from the bike's speed and resistance, coupled with factors like my weight and age. 
 But during the studio ride, my average heart rate jumped significantly — to 165 BPM — according to my chest monitor. So, I did push myself harder, as expected. But to my dismay, the display on the studio bike indicated that I actually burned 130 fewer calories compared to my average ride at home. In other words, I worked harder, but somehow burned less. 
 A studio employee explained that it's because ""each bike is calibrated slightly differently."" That means the calorie readout and work output, one of the metrics on which the calorie count is based, isn't accurate across bikes. 
 According to Peloton, the ""more information a rider provides in their rider profile, the more accurate their calorie count will be."" But if you really want a precise benchmark, you should only compare your own stats to previous rides on the same bike. 
My before and after stats were impressive
After two weeks of cycling with Peloton, I lost fat and gained muscle.
 Business Insider 
After cycling everyday for two weeks straight, I lost — wait for it — a pound and a half. According to Kuechenmeister, that's actually a lot for two weeks. But more importantly, I lost two pounds of pure fat, according to a machine that sent tingling electrical currents through my legs and arms to measure body composition. 
 ""Most doctors will recommend that about a pound to a pound and a quarter of fat per month is a healthy rate to be losing fat,"" Kuechenmeister said. ""So you're well ahead of that."" 
 I also improved my endurance, measured by something called VO2 Max. 
 ""That's a measurement of how well your body is utilizing the oxygen that you're taking in when you breathe,"" Kuechenmeister said. ""The better the use of oxygen, the more it's going to be transported throughout your body and the more efficiently you're going to be able to move and perform whatever exercise it is you're doing."" 
 In two weeks, my VO2 Max jumped from the 47th percentile to the 79th percentile, ranking me with ""an elite class of aerobic competitors."" 
 Finally, I gained some muscle, but only in my left leg — again, according to those electrical currents. That's probably due to stiffness in my right knee, Kuechenmeister said, which I had told him about earlier. With my right knee in pain, I favored my left, building muscle there as a result. 
Would I buy a Peloton bike?
 I probably wouldn't buy a Peloton bike. Realistically, I don't want to spin everyday. And when I am looking to cycle, I'm confident that I can get a better workout in a studio — whether it's at Peloton, SoulCycle, Flywheel, SWERVE, Cyc, Crank, Monster, RYDE, or one of the other cycling studios available to me in New York. 
 For me, the cost is hard to justify. 
 But if you love spin classes, yet don't live near a studio, don't want to leave your house, or hate working out in public, then you might find Peloton worth it.","Exercise startup Peloton has exploded in popularity — surpassing even the spin giant SoulCycle in customers, data from last year suggests.

Sarah Scoles,"Hunter Williams used to be an English teacher. Then, three years into that job, he started reading the book The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. The 1966 novel by Robert Heinlein takes place in the 2070s, on the moon, which, in this future, hosts a subterranean penal colony. Like all good sci-fi, the plot hinges on a rebellion and a computer that gains self-awareness. But more important to Williams were two basic fictional facts: First, people lived on the moon. Second, they mined the moon. “I thought, ‘This is it. This is what we really could be doing,” he says. Today, that vision is closer than ever. And Williams is taking steps to make it reality. This year, he enrolled in a class called Space Resources Fundamentals, the pilot course for the first-ever academic program specializing in space mining. It's a good time for such an education, given that companies like Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources are planning prospecting missions, NASA's OSIRIS-REx is on its way to get a sample of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth, and there's international and commercial talk of long-term living in space. Williams had grown up with the space-farers on Star Trek, but he found Heinlein’s vision more credible: a colony that dug into and used the resources of their celestial body. That's the central tenet of the as-yet-unrealized space mining industry: You can't take everything with you, and, even if you can, it's a whole lot cheaper not to—to mine water to make fuel, for instance, rather than launching it on overburdened rockets. “I saw a future that wasn't a hundred or a thousand years away but could be happening now,” says Williams. So in 2012, he adjusted trajectory and went to school for aerospace engineering. Then he worked at Cape Canaveral in Florida, doing ground support for Lockheed Martin. His building, on that cosmic coast, was right next to one of SpaceX's spots. “Every day when I came to work, I would see testaments to new technology,” he says. “It was inspiring.” A few years later, he still hadn't let go of the idea that humans could work with what they found in space. Like in his book. So he started talking to Christopher Dreyer, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines’ Center for Space Resources, a research and technology development center that's existed within the school for more than a decade. It was good timing. Because this summer, Mines announced its intention to found the world’s first graduate program in Space Resources —the science, technology, policy, and politics of prospecting, mining, and using those resources. The multidisciplinary program would offer Post-Baccalaureate certificates and Masters of Science degrees. Although it's still pending approval for a 2018 start date, the school is running its pilot course, taught by Dreyer, this semester. Williams has committed fully: He left his Canaveral job this summer and moved to Colorado to do research for Dreyer, and hopefully start the grad program in 2018. Williams wasn't the only one interested in the future of space mining. People from all over, non-traditional students, wanted to take Space Resources Fundamentals. And so Dreyer and Center for Space Resources director Angel Abbud-Madrid decided to run it remotely, ending up with about 15 enrollees who log in every Tuesday and Thursday night for the whole semester. Dreyer has a special setup in his office for his virtual lectures: a laptop stand, a wall of books behind him, a studio-type light that shines evenly. In the minutes before Thanskgiving-week class started, students' heads popped up on Dreyer's screen as they logged in. Some are full-time students at Mines; some work in industry; some work for the government. There was the employee from the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, an office tasked, in part, with making sure the US is obeying international treaties as they explore beyond the planet. Then there’s Justin Cyrus, the CEO of a startup called Lunar Outpost. Cyrus isn’t mining any moons yet, but Lunar Outpost has partnered with Denver’s Department of Environmental Health to deploy real-time air-quality sensors, of the kind it hopes to develop for moony use. Cyrus was a Mines graduate, with a master’s in electrical and electronics engineering; he sought out Dreyer and Abbud-Madrid when he needed advice for his nascent company. When the professors announced the space resources program, Cyrus decided to get in on this pilot class. He, and the other attendees, seem to see the class not just as an educational opportunity but also as a networking one: Their classmates, they say, are the future leaders of this industry. Cyrus, the FAA employee, and Williams all smiled from their screens in front of benign backgrounds. About a dozen other students—all men—joined in by the time class started. The day's lesson, about resources on the moon, came courtesy of scientist Paul Spudis, who live-broadcasted from a few states away. Spudis, a guest lecturer, showed charts and maps and data about resources the moon might harbor, and where, and their worth. He's bullish on the prospects of prospecting. Toward the end of his talk, he said, ""I think we'll have commercial landings on the moon in the next year or so."" Indeed, the company Moon Express is planning to land there in 2018, in a bid to win the Google Lunar X Prize. Back during Halloween week, the class covered the Outer Space Treaty, a creation of the United Nations that governs outer-space actions and (in some people's interpretations) makes the legality of space mining dubious. The lecture was full of policy detail, but the students drove the ensuing Q&amp;A toward the sociological. Space mining would disproportionately help already-wealthy countries, some thought, despite talk in the broader community about how space mining lowers the barrier to space entry. In this realism, and this thoughtfulness, Dreyer's class is refreshing. The PR talk of big would-be space mining companies like Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries can be slick, uncomplicated, and (sometimes) unrealistic. It often skips over the many steps between here and self-sustaining space societies—not to mention the companies' own long-term viability. But in Space Resource Fundamentals, the students seem grounded. Student Nicholas Proctor, one of few with a non-engineering background, appreciates the pragmatism. Proctor studied accounting as an undergrad and enrolled at Mines in mineral economics. After he received a NASA grant to study space-based solar power and its applications to the mining industry, Abbud-Madrid sent him an email telling him about the class. The professor thought it would be a good fit—and Proctor obviously agreed. After Thanksgiving-week class was over, students logged off, waving one-handed goodbyes. Williams had been watching from the lab downstairs, in a high-tech warehouse-garage combo. There, he and other students work among experiments about how dust moves in space, and what asteroids are actually like. Of course, they're also interested in how to get stuff—resources—out of them. An old metal chamber dominates the room, looking like an unpeopled iron lung. ""The big Apollo-era chamber is currently for asteroid mining,"" Williams explained, ""breaking apart rocks with sunlight and extracting the water and even precious metals."" While Williams closed up class shop downstairs, Dreyer and Abbud-Madrid hung out in Dreyer's office for a few minutes. Dreyer, leaning back in his well-lit chair, talked bemusedly about some of the communications they receive. “We get interest from people to find out what they can mine and bring back to Earth and become a trillionaire,” he said. That’s not really what the Space Resources program is about, in part because it’s not clear that’s possible—it’s expensive to bring the precious (to bring anything) back to Earth. The class focus—and, not coincidentally, the near-term harvest—is the H 2 O, which will stay in space, for space-use. “No matter how complex our society becomes, it always comes back to water,” said Abbud-Madrid. He laughed. “We’re going to the moon,” he continued. “For water.”",The first-ever graduate program for space miners-in-training is set to launch next year.

ADAM LIPTAK,"Much to my surprise, the judge throws out the settlement, he said. It occurs to me that there is an opportunity that no one is taking advantage of. Class action settlements have fairness hearings, and class members can protest. There would be an opportunity to move the law in the right direction. I started winning, he said, noting that he has handled more than two dozen appeals arising from objections to class action settlements. The system was ripe for change because the abuses were so big. Even his critics say Mr. Frank has played a valuable role. Although I often disagree with his objections, I think it is valuable to have a devils advocate challenging class action settlements and fee awards because there is otherwise often no meaningful pushback on what class counsel and the defendants put before the court, said Brian T. Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt Law School and the author of The Conservative Case for Class Actions, which will be published next year. Some people complain that his ultimate goal is to destroy, rather than improve, class actions, said Professor Fitzpatrick, who is visiting this semester at Harvard Law School. I am not sure if that is true he says it isnt but it doesnt really matter. A devils advocates job is to push back on everything, good and bad alike. The Supreme Court case, which will be argued Oct. 31, arose from an $8.5 million settlement between Google and class action lawyers who said the company had violated its users privacy rights. Under the settlement, the lawyers were paid more than $2 million, but members of the class they represented got nothing. Instead, the company agreed to make contributions to institutions concerned with privacy on the internet, including centers at Harvard, Stanford and Chicago-Kent College of Law. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld the settlement, with all three judges agreeing that trying to pay compensation to the class would be inefficient, as the individual payouts would be about 4 cents. In dissent, Judge J. Clifford Wallace expressed misgivings about the groups to which the payments were to be made. He said he was uneasy about the fact that a substantial portion of the money would go to law schools that the plaintiffs lawyers had attended.","Theodore Frank, a critic of class action settlements, will argue his own case.

Devin Coldewey,"Ever since Eraser, everyone wants a railgun. Turns out China is no exception. Some photos posted by Dafeng Cao, a Twitter user who keeps close tabs on Chinese military developments, show a ship-mounted gun that could very well be the country’s very own homegrown electromagnetically propelled mass driver. Railguns, or coil guns, accelerate solid metal projectiles using ultra-strong electromagnets, firing them well above speeds achieved by conventional ballistic methods. We’re talking Mach 6 here. The U.S. has been working on them for years, and has produced some very cool test videos, but I haven’t heard about any of them being mounted on ships. But Arnold can dual-wield them. It’s all speculation — not like the Chinese military would confirm, although apparently the railgun research is an open secret — but a few things point to the idea that this isn’t just an ordinary deck-mounted gun with a special fairing. First, its relatively short barrel tucked deep in that housing suggests that the acceleration components are all under there, much like the functioning American guns we’ve seen demonstrated. No sense having all that surface area unless it’s protecting something, otherwise you might as well paint a target on it. Hard to imagine conventional naval gun with such a size can be mounted on a 4000 ton class landing ship and didn't affect the stability of the ship. https://t.co/PGqh88iUv3 — dafeng cao (@xinfengcao) February 1, 2018 Second, the ship it’s on isn’t China’s standard test bed ship, the Type 909, despite those vessels being quite new and created for at-sea testing. Dafeng Cao cites a former Chinese Navy officer who says that this is likely because the power output of the 909 not high enough nor flexible enough to sustain the enormous power load necessary to fire these guns. The Type 072, which was used, is more easily retrofitted with… …The third clue, a set of shipping containers mounted just aft of the gun; if it’s anything the railguns we’ve seen, there’s a bunch of power and operational infrastructure that wouldn’t fit inside that fairing, but would fit in a couple containers.

That's pretty assertive and ambitious. pic.twitter.com/4L9cuh1tEX — dafeng cao (@xinfengcao) February 2, 2018 Last, a banner has just been raised on the ship that reads, roughly, “Providing first class weapons and equipment for building the best navy in the world.” So it sounds like this is a sort of If China has managed to mount its railgun on a ship, that means they’ve gone to great means to miniaturize and modularize this sophisticated and extremely heavy piece of equipment.

Aimée Lutkin,"There are some skills you hope you never need to use, but having them could be a matter of life and death: welcome to bleeding control. BleedingControl.org, an group begun by the American College of Surgeons, has successfully campaigned for a national Stop The Bleed Day ; the organization believes that many lives could be saved if ordinary citizens had some basic information on how to stop traumatic bleeding in an emergency situation. Reporter and certified EMT Tim Mak rounded up the most critical points on the day dedicated to bleeding awareness in an effort to teach more people how to save lives. According to Mak, 20 percent of people who die from bleeding could have been saved with this care, and bleeding to death is the top cause of preventable death. Here’s what you need to know. When was the last time you took a first aid class? The ‘80s? ‘90s? Like everything in the medical… Read more Read What To Look For It is possible to bleed to death from smaller wounds, but people who bleed out often do so because they have cut an artery. You will know an artery has been severed if blood is spurting from the wound and bright red. Also, if blood is pooling, if the injured person is unconscious, or if you’re seeing a partial or full amputation. A person with a severed artery can die in 2-3 minutes. When somebody gets a traumatic injury like a gunshot, it’s often not the trauma itself that kills… Read more Read How To Intervene Mak provided a step-by-step guide which may seem simple, but in a scenario where someone is massively bleeding, you might be a little panicked. Simple rules help. First, make sure you’re not stepping into danger. Then, call 911. Even if you’re about to stop the bleeding successfully, you want trained medical professionals to get there ASAP. Then you find the injury and apply pressure to stop the blood loss. You may not have a tourniquet on hand, but if you do, tie it off between the blood flow and the exit wound, above the injury. If not, or if the wound is too big to be contained by a tourniquet, grab a clean cloth or hemostatic (bleeding control) gauze, if available. Pack the wound and hold it down with steady pressure. You’re trying to close off the artery and keep it closed until help can arrive. Mak advises people apply as much pressure as possible, because even if the injury is severe, the artery is fairly deep inside the body. You need to press hard to reach it and shut it off. Finally, if you have the presence of mind to do so, mark the time the tourniquet or pressure was applied. This is useful information for medical professionals, as there are dangers to leaving tourniquets on too long. These are the basics, but if you want to take a hands on class for free, Bleeding Control offers them all over the country.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"The open letter is just one example of this deception. The bill’s defenders frequently say some version of, “We need tax reform.” But their plan bears little resemblance to meaningful tax reform. It’s akin to telling someone, “You need a new car,” and then giving the person a lemon. (For those who want more detail on the open letter, Jason Furman walks through its distortions in more detail.) 2. Talk about the plan’s middle-class tax cuts — and ignore the middle-class tax increases. The plan is a windfall for the wealthy, but it’s quite mixed for the middle class and poor. Some provisions raise taxes on the middle class and poor. Others cut taxes. Long term, most families would probably be worse off, as I’ve explained before. One favorite sleight of hand from the plan’s supporters is to talk only about the provisions that help the middle class and conveniently fail to mention the other parts. Take Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican, who went on “Meet the Press” this weekend to sell the bill. “The middle class tax cuts are in there,” Portman said. “It doubles the standard deduction up to 24 grand for a family. It doubles the child tax credit. It actually — it lowers the rates.” All that is true. Unfortunately, Senator Portman left out the elimination of the personal exemption, which protects $4,000 per person from income taxes. He left out the elimination of various tax breaks that help the middle class. And he left out the introduction of a new inflation measure that will push more families into higher tax brackets over time. 3. Pretend that the future will never arrive. To hold down the estimated cost of the bill, Senate leaders have set some of its biggest provisions — the ones that most benefit the middle class — to expire over the next decade. The corporate tax cuts, by contrast, are permanent. But when the plan’s defenders describe the bill, they tend to be talking about a point before the bill is fully implemented — without admitting as much. If you hear a senator talking about a $1,000 tax cut that a typical middle-class family would receive, it’s in one of the plan’s early years. (If you hear a senator talking about a bigger tax cut, as Portman and many others do, they’re usually talking about the upper middle class or affluent without saying so.) By the time the bill is fully implemented, it will be a net tax increase on every income group below $75,000 a year. It will also leave federal taxes virtually unchanged for families making between $75,000 and $100,000. For the wealthy, it’s still a tax cut. And all of these estimates understate the long-term damage to the middle class, because they ignore the cuts to education, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that will eventually be necessary to reduce the deficit. 4. Rush, rush, rush. Perhaps the biggest giveaway about the plan is the way that its supporters are trying to push it through Congress as quickly as possible. They’re not holding hearings where experts can debate the content of the plan. They are not even waiting for a final analysis from Congress’s official tax arbiter, the Joint Committee on Taxation. They understand that facts and debate hurt their cause. They are hoping that partisan loyalty is strong enough to overcome substance. Related. “If the tax bill is so great,” Catherine Rampell asked in a recent Washington Post column, “why does the GOP keep lying about it?” “Why would anyone write a bill full of provisions that evaporate over time?” Paul Krugman asks. “There’s no economic or policy logic behind it. Instead, it’s all about trying to have it both ways, making a safe space for political double talk.” Poll after poll has shown that the tax plan is deeply unpopular, typically with a national approval rating around 30 percent. Three new polls show that the plan is similarly unpopular in Arizona, Maine and Tennessee, three states with swing-vote senators. In fact, it’s not clear any piece of legislation so unpopular has ever before become law, as Seth Hanlon notes. The failed Roy Moore scam. A conservative group tried to entrap some Washington Post reporters while peddling a fake story about Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate with a history of pursuing teenage girls. The scam failed, and you can watch it fail on video.

Ron Miller,"ScopeAR, a graduate of the Y Combinator Summer 2015 class, came to the augmented reality game very early, launching in 2011 when there was very little hardware and most people didn’t understand the technology. But it has managed to hang around long enough for the market and the hardware to finally catch with the founders’ vision of using AR as an advanced training tool in the enterprise. Today, the company offers a pair of tools. First of all, there is RemoteAR, which CEO and company co-founder Scott Montgomerie describes as “Facetime with AR on top of it.” It allows a technician to virtually look over the shoulder at what a local person is seeing and provide directions and feedback in real time remotely. For example, the expert could circle the cover the technician needs to remove and point to the screws with two virtual arrows. This could have great utility in any situation where you have an experienced person in the office, who doesn’t want to go on the road on anymore, but can still provide detailed instructions to a novice, acting as a trainer and helper. This is an actual problem in many industries with aging workforces. Technician working with RemoteAR. Photo: ScopeAR The second product, called WorkLink, lets you import a 3D CAD model, then associate that model with real equipment. When you put on hardware like Microsoft Hololens, you can see the 3D representation of the equipment and follow along with instructions on how to repair it. It also works with iOS, Android and Windows devices. One big change since the company was established in 2011 is the variety of platforms you can use for augmented reality. “Last year was the thing where AR took off. Apple got into it with ARKit and Google with ARCore and awareness happened and people saw it was viable,” Montgomerie said. By creating enterprise use cases like remote assistance and work instructions, the company has been gaining momentum over the last year, and reports tripling its revenue in 2017. Although they aren’t sharing a specific number, it’s fair to say they are growing quickly. They developed an augmented reality training product early on that resonated with a mining company, and that along with consulting working with the likes of NASA, Boeing and Toyota, helped them stay afloat until things began to really click around AR in recent years, Montgomerie explained. They also took some time to be part of the Y Combinator Summer 2015 class, and even scored a spot on TechCrunch’s list of favorite Demo Day 2 startups. During the YC experience, they developed the first version of RemoteAR. WorkLink followed a year later. So far the company has taken on a a fairly modest amount of investment with Montgomerie reporting three seed rounds including $2 million right after Y Combinator, $1.7 million last May and another $2 million this past December. If the company continues to grow at this rate, it’s a good bet they will be looking for a Series A at some point to help scale the company further.","ScopeAR, a graduate of the Y Combinator Summer 2015 class, came to the augmented reality game very early, launching in 2011 when there was very little hardware and most people didn’t understand the technology.

David Nield,"As with a lot of tech purchasing decisions, when it comes to buying a memory card you cant just click on the first result that appears on your online retailer of choice and thats thattodays memory cards, with their small sizes and huge capacities, have features and specs all of their own. Heres what you need to know. The memory card explained Youre probably most familiar with memory cards from slotting one into your digital camera or your smartphone. They use solid-state, flash memory similar to the internal storage inside your phone or laptop, with speedy read and write times, and the ability to pack a lot of storage into a small space. As time has gone on, memory cards have been packing more and more storage into cards that have gotten smaller and smaller: The (relatively) chunky cards of the mid-1990s had capacities as small as 2MB, reflecting one of their original goalsto replace the 1.44MB floppy disk. As the 2000s wore on, the SD (Secure Digital) card format established as a joint venture between Toshiba, SanDisk and Panasonic started to dominate the market, followed by the microSD, SDXC and microSDXC cards we have todaywith capacities maxing out at 512GB, if you can afford the asking prices. Other memory card formats are still around for various uses, but the SD and microSD variants are most commonly used in phones and cameras, so well focus on them here. Theyll fit into everything from your drone to your Nintendo Switch. Start shopping for a card, and youll notice a host of different numbers and letters on the face of the card and in its tech specs. Theres actually quite a bit of redundancy going on here (as in some specs are just repeating themselves), but its worth digging in to find out what each of them are referring to. Memory card features and specs To start with youve got a choice of sizes: The standard SD ones (mostly for digital cameras and bigger gear) and the smaller microSD ones (originally developed for, and still used in, smartphones). Extra letters after the SD mean a newer, improved standard, with room for greater capacities and faster speedsthese include HC (High Capacity) and the latest XC (Extended Capacity), and both are used across the SD and microSD form factors today. MicroSDXC cards are the top choice for your phone, and the SDXC cards are your top choice for everything else. After that, the key spec is obviously the capacity, or how much data a card can hold. Newer HC and XC cards offer more storage because of their file systems and various other tweaks, with the newest cards on the market now hitting 512GB (with a theoretical limit thats even higher). Then theres speed, or how fast a memory card can read and write data. If youre shooting high-resolution images, you dont want to have to wait seconds between shots for them to be written to your memory card. Write speed is most important, and is usually specified with a Speed Class rating. The minimum performances you can expect are Class 2 (at least 2 MB/s), Class 4 (at least 4 MB/s), Class 6 (at least 6 MB/s), or Class 10 (at least 10 MB/s). Some card makers will also list a maximum speed and/or a read speed separately to distinguish between different cards. In addition to the raw write speed theres an extra spec to be aware of for higher-end cards: Ultra High Speed (UHS). This is usually written as U1 (write speeds of at least 10 MB/s, like Class 10) or U3 (at least 30 MB/s), but you might also see references to UHS-I, UHS-II, and UHS-III in card specs. These are the potential speeds of the card architecture (the bus speeds) rather than raw transfer speeds, so while related, theyre not actually the same. Dont worry too much about UHS-I, UHS-II, or UHS-IIIlook for U1 or U3 insteadbut if you see them, you know what they are. Theoretical data transfer rates of 104 MB/s are possible with UHS-I, 312 MB/s with UHS-II, and a whopping 624 MB/s with UHS-II, while cards without a UHS rating are stuck at 25 MB/s. However, the flash memory itself and the connected gadgets need to be able to support those bus speeds too. Some cards, particularly older or cheaper ones, will just quote a maximum read or write speeds (as opposed to the minimum write speed indicated by the Speed Class rating)although its important to note that this is usually a maximum rating that you wont get consistently. They might also quote a figure like 150x, which essentially means how much faster it is compared to the read speed of a CD. But thats an outdated reference, which is why you dont see it used much any more. Theres one more spec to talk about, the new Video Speed Class which is designed to help you pick the right card for saving 4K or even 8K video. Youve got V6 (write speeds of up to 6MB/s, like Class 6), V10 (up to 10 MB/s, like Class 10), V30 (up to 30 MB/s, like U3), V60 (up to 60 MB/s), and V90 (up to 90 MB/s). Video Speed Class appears on the fastest and newest XC cards, so look for it if you need top performance. Choosing the right card If youre still with us, congratulations. Youre not quite home and dry just yet though, because as well as working out the spec you need, you also need to make sure its actually going to work in your device. Not all card types or all capacities will work in all phones and cameras, particularly if youre using a gadget thats a few years old. Thankfully, your devices should prominently list the memory cards theyre compatible with, and might even offer some recommendations for a minimum Speed Class. Most Class 10/U1/V10 cards will handle 1080p video comfortably, but for 4K footage its a good idea to go up to U3/V30 instead, otherwise you run the risk of losing frames resulting in stuttered video. Its also worth noting that your choice of memory card doesnt affect the quality of your photos or videosbut more expensive cards can save and process files faster, more reliably, with less chance of errors, and with a better chance of file recovery if the data gets erased. When youve got billions of incoming pixels from a 4K video capture, those are very important factors to consider. Theres some backwards compatibility between new and old standards, so a device capable of reading SDXC cards will be able to read SD and SDHC cards too, albeit at slower speeds. But the reverse isnt true, so you cant just stick an SDXC card in a gadget that only supports SD and SDHC. As weve said, it should be fairly easy to find out which cards are compatible with a given device, but youll want to make sure to double-check each time. (The Nintendo Switch, for example, needs a UHS-I card ). When youve got a handle on the speed you need, you can then decide how much capacity you want, or can afford. The highest capacities (currently 512GB) are usually very expensive, as the tech that makes them possible is only just out of development. So you might find a better value with a smaller card. But as with read and write speeds, youll also want to make sure youre not spending a lot of money on a giant card thats actually too big for your phone or camera to deal with. The most important thing is to first confirm what formats and capacities it supports.","As with a lot of tech purchasing decisions, when it comes to buying a memory card you can’t just click on the first result that appears on your online retailer of choice and that’s that—today’s memory cards, with their small sizes and huge capacities, have fe…",2018-11-23T18:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",How to Pick the Right Memory Card for Every Device You Own,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-pick-the-right-memory-card-for-every-device-you-1829990169,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--PCSa6j3c--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/ivzj1o4dyhrgrwveudan.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,class-2,1
Kate Clark,"Indigo, the startup bringing algorithms and machine learning to the agricultural industry, has raised a $250 million Series E, bringing its total raised to $650 million. The funding values the company at $3.5 billion, according to a source familiar with the deal. That’s a steep increase from its previously reported value: $1.4 billion with a $156 million Series D last September. Existing investors Baillie Gifford, the Alaska Permanent Fund, the Investment Corporation of Dubai and Flagship Pioneering participated in the round. New investors, who Indigo declined to name, also participated. Indigo initially launched in 2014 to help farmers improve the health and productivity of their crops with microbial products that protect against the environment, disease and pest stress. Now, the company is expanding its suite of digital tools with the launch of Indigo Marketplace, which is essentially eBay for farmers. Indigo CEO David Perry, who grew up on a farm in Arkansas, told TechCrunch Indigo expects to do $500 million in bookings this year thanks to the early growth of the new product. That’s more than 8x growth YoY. Indigo first began rolling out the online grain marketplace to its network of farmers in June and has since seen more than $6 billion worth of grain put up for sale by farmers. Buyers have placed more than 4,000 bids worth $2 billion. Perry, a serial entrepreneur — he co-founded Better Therapeutics and Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired for $5.2 billion by Pfizer — says Indigo’s marketplace has had the most rapid adoption of any product launch he’s been associated with in his career. “It’s part of a bigger plan,” he said. “We knew microbiology was a cornerstone to changing agriculture but it couldn’t do it by itself.” Using Indigo Marketplace, buyers can purchase grain directly from farmers. They can filter by protein content, milling quality or by production practices, i.e. whether it’s organic or not. Growers are paid based on the quality of their crop, which is determined by a sample sent to a third-party lab for analysis. Indigo manages the testing, the transportation of the crop and the payment through its new platform. Venture capital investment in agtech has been steadily growing in the last decade with more and more early-stage startups emerging to compete with the Big 6 of agriculture: Monsanto, Bayer, DuPont, Dow, Syngenta and BASF. The industry, according to agtech firm Finistere Ventures, has transitioned “from a niche, opportunistic clade of the venture capital investment class, to a legitimate asset class attracting focused and generalist funds.” As for Indigo, it has been and continues to be the most valuable private agtech startup.","Indigo, the startup bringing algorithms and machine learning to the agricultural industry, has raised a $250 million Series E, bringing its total raised to $650 million.

Leigh Anderson,"Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold! For some people, the first freeze of winter is doubly depressing—we’re close to the shortest day of the year, which means we’re not getting a good dose of sunlight, and it’s too cold to go outside and get some exercise and fresh air. But don’t despair! Winter can be a season for hibernation, sure, but if you’re clever and plan ahead, you won’t necessarily start climbing the walls. This AskMetafilter question was posted by a user with mobility issues who hates the forced confinement of freezing temps, and commenters chimed in with many useful suggestions on how to weather the winter with one’s good spirits intact. Below are the indoor-entertainment possibilities that resonated the most with me, but definitely check out the whole thread for even more ideas. 1. Deal with your house In my family, the run-up to Christmas causes me a certain amount of mild anxiety. I know a deluge of new gifts for my kids is coming, and it feels like that water level in our cramped apartment is rising. So take a few evenings or a weekend and cull your closets, shelves, and that pile of stuff by the door (we all have one). Or redecorate a room or sew some new pillow covers or build a bookcase. I know that nothing makes me feel more accomplished than painting a room and hauling a load of stuff to the Good Will. Sprucing up your living space provides a sense of satisfaction; it also just...spruces up your living space. Which is nice when you’re trapped there. For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read 2. Get active for a cause Is the current political environment making you antsy? Do you want to use your time to help other people? You’re not alone. And even if you can’t go door-to-door and attend meetings, you can still do a lot of good work online or on your phone. VolunteerMatch will help you find volunteer opportunities in fields that interest you, and you can filter the results by “virtual opportunities.” (Note—it doesn’t filter perfectly, so you have to read carefully. But there are still lots of chances to help out with web design or admin support for organizations getting off the ground.) If you already have a favorite nonprofit or political candidate, contact them directly and ask how you can help from home. 3. Get completist about a subject This winter I want to learn to play a certain fiddle tune on the guitar in all 12 keys. Will I actually complete it? I doubt it. But by April I might make it through four keys, which is still better than the zero keys I know it in now. I’m also planning a personal mini-class on the Civil War, complete with the Ken Burns documentary and a few thick books already on my nightstand. By the spring I’ll basically have a Ph.D. 4. Host Make people trudge through the snow to you. Put on a pot of stew, bake some bread, and break out the whiskey. How do you think that people in cold climates stay social? Winter is back, and it's colder than ever. Coupled with snow, dry air, sickness, and… Read more Read 5. Get a penpal Postcrossing is something I’ve never heard of, but it seems to be a way to have short correspondences, via postcard, with people all over the world. There are also sites that will match you with more traditional pen pals (check this post out for safety tips before you start). 6. Take an online class Want to bone up on your art history, your calculus, your knife technique? Google around for virtual instruction in whatever subject is grabbing you. I’d probably try some kind of write-your-novel class that would force me to turn in a certain number of pages each week, but there’s obviously a huge range of subjects to choose from. If you live in a snowy place and you don’t have a hot water bottle at the foot of your bed, I’m… Read more Read 7. Proofread Project Gutenberg needs proofreaders for their scanned books. You get to read and help distribute great works of literature at the same time! And of course there are the old cold-weather standbys, like cooking, crafting, and playing music, and the new cold-weather standbys, like video games and social media. Do you have a novel way of getting through a hard winter without losing your mind? Let us know in the comments!","Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold!

They're the perfect combination of highbrow art for adults and pop culture for (inner) children. The prints feature nostalgic renditions of your favorite characters: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Deadpool, Hulk, and Spiderman.

JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"Was it? Roseanne Barr the performer is pro-Trump; so is Roseanne the character. But “Roseanne” the show was less pro-Trump than pro-Roseanne, working to assure the audience that, whether you thought she was right or wrong, she meant well. Her argument with Jackie, for instance, mostly sidestepped questions of racism, or xenophobia, or Mr. Trump’s dog-whistle nostalgia for “the old days.” Instead, she said that Mr. Trump (though not mentioned by name on the show) “talked about jobs.” Was that the only reason she voted for him? I don’t know. But I 100 percent believe that’s what she would say her motivation was. People sell themselves, all the time, on the most charitable interpretations of their actions. But the following week’s episode had an offhand line that suggested there was a kind of white-identity politics under the surface here. The Conners woke up in front of the TV, having slept through, Dan said, “all the shows about black and Asian families.” (The reference was to “black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat,” the only two such sitcoms on ABC.) “They’re just like us,” Roseanne said. “There, now you’re all caught up.” The line felt like a sarcastic slap. Ms. Barr defended it on Twitter as “ a joke about class solidarity.” If so, it was a weird one because 1) both of the referenced shows are about more affluent families; 2) if Ms. Barr knows how to do one thing, it’s to make sure you know sarcasm when she delivers it; and 3) if the line were about class solidarity, it would be … not really a joke but simply a statement. The season’s seventh episode left less ambiguity. In “Go, Cubs!” Roseanne met her new Muslim neighbors, who she was afraid are terrorists. The publicity for the episode emphasized that Ms. Barr wanted her character to get a “comeuppance” for her prejudice.","The sitcom’s revival was a topical hit, but the political pot-stirring — onscreen and off — overshadowed the show’s strengths.",2018-05-23T00:31:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Critic’s Notebook: It Was ‘Roseanne’ vs. ‘Roseanne,’ in a Polarizing Revival",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/arts/television/roseanne-season-finale-roseanne-barr.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/arts/television/23roseanne-2/23roseanne-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1

Frederic Lardinois,"If you live and work in the Microsoft Office ecosystem but often use a Mac, here is some good news: OneDrive Files On-Demand is now available in public preview for MacOS. Files-On Demand was one of the marquee features of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. The general idea here is you can store your files in the cloud and sync them between devices, but while they show up in your Windows Explorer and — now — MacOS Finder, those files don’t actually have to be downloaded. Instead, as the name so smartly implies, Files On-Demand only downloads them as needed, freeing up precious local storage space. Of course, you can always opt to sync every file, too. You really don’t want to have to sync a 2 GB file over slow airplane Wi-Fi, after all. Microsoft notes that it is committed to “to the Mac as a first-class endpoint” and that it continues to invest in the platform.

Meredith Cash,"At the beginning of the college basketball season, blowout contests are par for the course. Fans are used to watching the top teams in the country annihilate no-name squads in what amount to glorified exhibition games for the majority of November. This year was supposed to be different. The Champions Classic kicked off the 2018-19 college basketball season with a pair of games matching up top-10 teams that were expected to be competitive. But the Duke Blue Devils still managed to secure an early season blowout, and it came against the No. 2 team in the country. The fourth-ranked Blue Devils dealt head coach John Calipari the worst defeat of his career at any level Tuesday night with a 118-84 rout of his Kentucky Wildcats. The marquee matchup between Duke and the Wildcats — who were co-favorites to win the 2019 NCAA Championship heading into Tuesday night's contest — became a show for the Blue Devil freshmen who comprised the nation's best recruiting class of the year and maybe ever. Duke's freshmen outscored the entire Kentucky roster with a combined 89 points on the night. AP preseason All-America selection R.J. Barrett erupted for 33 points, 6 assists, and 4 rebounds to break the previous scoring record for a Blue Devil freshman in their debut. In just 23 minutes on the floor, social media sensation Zion Williamson also surpassed that 25-point benchmark set by Marvin Bagley III against the Elon Phoenix last season with 28 points and 7 rebounds. Heading into the season, the biggest question surrounding Williamson was whether or not he could actually shoot. He silenced his naysayers early, sinking a three-point attempt for the first points of his college career and shooting a whopping 85 percent from the field on the night. And, of course, he added more highlights from there: Classmates Cam Reddish and Tre Jones proved themselves in their debuts as well. Reddish — a sharpshooting small forward and the No. 3 recruit in the class of 2018 — notched 22 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the floor and drained three shots from beyond the arc. Jones — a five-star point guard and the younger brother of Duke 2014 national champion Tyus Jones — dropped a game-high seven dimes in the trouncing of what was universally considered one of the best teams in the country. ""When you start four freshmen, no matter how talented they are, you don't know what they are going to do in this environment against an outstanding team and a great program,"" Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said, per Steve Wiseman at The News &amp; Observer.

"Jay Reed, Benji Jones and Rob Ludacer","Following is a transcript of the video.
Benji Jones: This bike costs $2,000, and it's taking the cycling world by storm. It's sold by the company Peloton, which reportedly now has more customers than even the spin giant SoulCycle. But what really sets it apart is convenience. Using a monitor attached to the bike, you can join a spin class from anywhere and, according to the company, get a studio-grade workout. Now, that sounds pretty nice, but is it really worth the hype? 
 To find out, I took a Peloton bike for a spin. Over the course of two weeks, I did a 45-minute Peloton class every day. And how did it go? Well, let's just say I'll probably never be this fit ever again. First things first: To figure out just how good of a workout I'd be getting, I visited the athletic trainer Sean Kuechenmeister before my first class. 
Sean Kuechenmeister: You're going to hopefully establish your baseline level of fitness for biking specifically. 
Benji: Sean works at the New York Sports Science Lab in Staten Island, and there he assesses the physical ability of professional athletes. And now me, your more average gym-goer. All right, good to go. We started out by gathering some basic metrics like weight and body fat. Next were some not-so-basic measurements. 
 I feel like I'm in, like, an ejection seat. That's an isokinetic extremity machine. It measures the strength of my quads. After that, we tested leg power... 
Sean: Jump. 
Benji: ...mobility, and something called muscle drive. 
Sean: So drive would be how much electrical current you're getting from the brain through those nerves. The muscles are really just kind of like the mindless meat. The nerves are what determines how efficiently the muscles move. 
Benji: But the most difficult test of all? A measure of what's called VO2 max. 
Sean: The reason why the VO2 max is so relevant for bikers is that's a measurement of how well your body's utilizing the oxygen that you're taking in when you breathe. The better you use the oxygen, the more it's gonna be transported throughout your body and the more efficiently you're gonna be able to move and perform whatever exercise it is you're doing. 
Benji: I scored below average in VO2 max, in the 47th percentile, which was kind of a bummer. But overall, I was in pretty good shape, and with the assessment behind me, it was time to ride. This time, fortunately, without a gas mask. 
 It got off to kind of a rough start because I couldn't really get on the bike at first. I was just totally not feeling the music, just kind of like oldies or, like, rock. I'm not about to bike out to rock. I ended up joining a prerecorded class, and I thought I was, like, doing really well in the class and then looked and saw that I was in 589th place, I think. To my credit, there were like 2,500 people in this class, and that made me feel pretty average, which is totally fine. My quads are already starting to feel it. I can definitely feel a burn. I did a little bit better today, look at that. 2,136th place out of 10,000. I mean, not terrible! 
 I was tired almost right from the start, but the days went by quickly, and soon enough I was a week in. I am proud to say that I made it seven days in a row! But I wasn't exactly seeing much progress. Instead, I was actually feeling some pain. I'm definitely starting to feel a little bit of pain in my right knee. You know, to be honest, all of my stats look exactly the same today as they did my first ride. I was burning a little over 500 calories a class, no matter how exhausted I felt at the finish line, but I wasn't about to quit, especially since Sean had predicted some pretty rad results I could look forward to. 
Sean: I think if you're gonna lose fat and then potentially burn into some muscle, I think we may see you go from 143 maybe to about 141, 140, um, but I do expect your endurance to go up, and I do expect this number with your VO2 max to go from fair to good. 
Benji: For my eighth ride, I switched it up. Instead of riding at home, I went to the Peloton studio in Manhattan where the classes are filmed. I was curious if I would push myself harder in front of an instructor and in the presence of what seems to be some of New York City's most fit and attractive. 
 It was a good time. It's the day before Valentine's Day, so there was lots of breakup songs, which was great. But as it turns out, all bikes are calibrated differently, so my readout on my bike in the studio was super different than the bike that I have at home. There was probably like a 200-calorie difference. So I did push myself harder in the studio. My average heart rate was 10% higher than it was at home, but according to the display on my studio bike, my output and calorie count was my lowest yet. So fair warning, the calorie counters might be different if you don't use the same bike every time. As I reached the middle of the second week, my output was finally starting to improve. 
 I feel pretty good. Losing body fat, feeling like my legs are probably like a thousand times stronger. Hopefully that's the case. I also broke 600 calories in one ride today, which means that I'm getting better in the, like, on my journey to strength on the bike. Wait, journey to strength? Side note: If I had any critique of Peloton as I neared the end, it's not the quality of the workout... 
Instructor: If something came up for you in the form of energy 
Benji: It's the language the instructors use to motivate you. It might be a personal thing, but it just feels so inauthentic. This is an exercise class, not therapy. Anyway. A few days later came the moment I was waiting for. The end! Woo! 14 classes! Yeah, it feels really good to be done, probably 'cause of meeting my goal of doing this, partly because I am so excited to not feel so exhausted and not have to bike every day. Not that it hasn't been rewarding, it's just obviously too much to do this every single day. 
 Let's see, 14 workouts, 10 1/2 hours, 194 miles, 7,745 calories, that was the best output I've gotten so far. I also broke 600 calories in one ride today, which means that I'm getting better, and you can see that I kind of started out really strong and then kind of took a dip and then started working up again. The next day, I returned to the lab for my follow-up assessment. 
Sean: Your initial measurement, you were 143.5. You're 142 today along with that point zero, but your lean body mass, which is your muscle, your bone, you know, the connected tissue, first time was 125.2. Second time, it's 125.4, so you lost nothing but fat. You maintained your muscle. In fact, you gained 0.2 pounds of muscle during all of that. 
Benji: Interestingly, all that new muscle I'd gained ended up in just one spot: my left leg. Remember that pain I was talking about in my right knee? Well, I adapted by relying more on my left to pedal, building muscle there as a result. Everywhere else in my body, I actually lost muscle weight. 
Sean: You lost weight in the trunk. You lost weight in your left arm, and you lost weight in your right arm. 
Benji: And that's because I was only doing one type of activity every day. But the biggest change was in my VO2 max. 
Trainer: So this was his initial, and this is his new one where he's ranked only 79% now. 
Camera operator: That is incredible! 
Sean: 47 to 79. 
Benji: So I'm, like, better than most people? 
Sean: Yes. You went from worse than most people to a lot better than most people. 
Benji: Wow. That's amazing, wow! OK, so more muscle in my left leg, less everywhere else, and much greater endurance. What about strength? 
Sean: You actually lost power. You increased in your strength in terms of your endurance, as far as aerobic capacity, but as far as anaerobic, the system of our body that uses more sugar, uses glycogen, what we use to produce power and strength, you actually decreased in that. 
Benji: And in terms of just, like, trying to understand these numbers, for two weeks, like are these pretty big changes? 
Sean: Oh yeah, for sure, for sure. I think most, most doctors will recommend that about a pound to a pound and a quarter of fat per month is a healthy rate to be losing fat, so you're actually well ahead of that, so I think if you were to continue this, you would probably - you'd lose more fat, you might gain some more muscle, but eventually there would be a point of diminishing returns where we'd need to change something up in the routine. 
Benji: Got it, OK. 
Sean: This was good for a two-week challenge, but I think it's not very long-term sustainable. 
Benji: OK. And that's a good thing because the thought of biking right now, well, it's kind of terrible. But should I ever need to lose weight again and stumble upon a mountain of cash, I'm confident that two weeks of intense cycling like this will totally do the trick.","Peloton sells a stationary bike for $1,995 and it's recently exploded in popularity, surpassing even the spin giant SoulCycle in customers, data from last year suggests.

Lindsay Dodgson,"On New Year's Day, Cathay Pacific Airways briefly sold business and first class tickets at a fraction of their retail price due to a ticketing error, and it honoured the cheap prices. 
 Now, the airline has had its second blunder this month, with first class tickets from Hong Kong to Portugal being sold for $1,512 instead of $16,000 — and it looks like passengers who were lucky enough to grab the accidental deal will once again be allowed to travel with the ticket. 
Read more: Cathay Pacific accidentally sold $16,000 first and business class flights for $675, and it's honoring the discount fares
 The cheap tickets were on sale until at least 11.30 a.m. on Sunday, according to the South China Morning Post. 
 ""We are aware of an error on some fares from Europe on our website because of an input issue,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The sale of such fares was stopped immediately."" 
 The airline added that it is looking into the cause of the error, both internally and externally. 
 ""For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services,"" it added, despite the fact the error may have cost the airline millions of dollars. 
 Airlines do not always honour an error fare. 
 While Singapore Airlines honoured tickets sold for less than half their original price in 2014, United Airlines cancelled ones sold for $100 by a ""third party software provider"" in 2015, according to the BBC. 
 ""Human errors can happen, no matter how sophisticated a company is,"" Civic Party lawmaker and commercial pilot Jeremy Tam Man-ho told the SCMP. ""But if the same kind of errors happen repeatedly in a short space of time, it may indicate a bigger problem."" 
 It looks like 2019 won't be much kinder to Cathay. In September last year, the airline was ridiculed for spelling its name wrong on the side of one of its planes— missing an ""f"" from ""Pacific,"" spelling out: ""Cathay Paciic."" 
 Last October, the airline also suffered a data breach which jeopardised the personal information of over nine million passengers.","Cathay Pacific Airways isn't having the best start to 2019.

 Professor Nathan Alexander said baby Assata was ""extremely well behaved""
A US maths professor has received praise after images of him looking after a student's baby during class went viral on social media.
Baby Assata was brought to the lesson by her father, Wayne Hayer, who had been unable to find a babysitter.
After explaining his situation, Professor Nathan Alexander held the child for his whole 50-minute class so Mr Hayer could ""take good notes.""
""I don't have children of my own,"" Mr Alexander told Buzzfeed News. 
""I was worried that she would start crying but it actually went perfectly. She was extremely well behaved.""
Professor Alexander teaches at Morehouse, an all-male, historically black liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia.
One of the school's most famous graduates was civil rights activist Dr Martin Luther King Jr.
Mr Alexander, 34, reportedly told Mr Hayer that he could bring his daughter to class after noticing that he often had to leave early to look after her.
""He works two jobs, is a full time student, is involved in leadership programmes at school and is a parent,"" Mr Alexander said in an interview with CNN. 
""This photo serves as a reminder of what parents have to do every day and how important it is to have affordable childcare.""
Speaking to Buzzfeed News, he said he bounced the baby girl up and down during the class and joked about sending her to sleep with his teaching.
""When she started falling asleep, I told the class 'I guess I'm being boring right now',"" Mr Alexander said.
The picture was widely shared on social media with an outpouring of support for Mr Alexander and his teaching skills.
Skip Twitter post by @djnotag_MY FAVORITE TEACHER! He saved my grade in college algebra my first semester at Morehouse. I was in another section with arguably the WORST teacher in the school, ready to drop out, but he saw I was on the edge and personally tutored me. Went from a D to an A by senesters end.

Other professors have also offered to help their students with childcare.
In a Facebook post, Assata's mother, Firda Hayer, expressed her thanks to Mr Alexander and to other social media users for their encouragement.
Mr Alexander said in a Tweet that he ""appreciate[d] the love,"" but told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper: ""I'm not an exception.

Mat Smith,"The startup showcased the portable muscle recovery tool at CES, and it's backed up by several scientific papers that elaborate on the medical applications of active compression. On the Spryng, there are three different intensity modes and patterns, but the focus is more on active compression, affecting your circulation in a positive way, rather than the wonderful massage feeling the Spryng conferred to my worn-out legs.
The jury is out on compression tights and tops (but if it makes you feel better— why not?), but compression therapy has more tangible benefits to blood circulation issues, like deep vein thrombosis, diabetes and more.
That was apparently the initial aim for this wearable, and the startup is looking to pick up FDA approval for a Class 2 device (it's currently Class 1) so that the Spryng can be used in a medical context. Interestingly, the degree of massage for medical usage is actually less than the settings used for recovery.
I may have over-zealously leapt into some fitness-based new year's resolutions the weekend before CES started. Too many squats or deadlifts means suffering was just one sleep away. With some very stiff hamstrings, I tried used the Spryng to aid my recovery. Depending on your choice of pants, while a little bulky, both wraps fit under looser trousers. They inflate only a little externally, but the internal force is surprisingly powerful.
""It's pretty simple. It focuses on the lower limbs, as the calf muscles are responsible for pumping blood back up to the upper body and the heart,"" said Spryng's ""Chief of Recovery"", Heshika Deegahawathura.
He notes that existing compression solutions from medical manufacturers are bulky, and not all that accessible. According to the team, Spryng is for ""day-to-day runners"". The main theory is that by pinpointing the calves, the benefits transfer to your circulatory system as a whole. Deegahawathura adds: ""[Runners] don't want to stay around to recover, they want to go out after they've finished their run. They want to go have a drink, do something else.""
With an infrared emitter and receiver on the pair of wraps, they can be used synchronized or on their own, and you're free to walk around, sit, or stand while they're working. I think there's a lot of benefit to the therapeutic feel of the device -- it's not excessively aggressive, and felt like my calves were being massaged. There's a charging port and while there is a Bluetooth radio, the team isn't yet offering a companion app with remote controls.
Some of the studies done regarding active compression suggest it can improve performance up to 50%, but think of that as the best possible scenario. My aching legs did feel better, but there's limits to how much compression can aid recovery. Anything that helps is a good thing, however, and the Spryng came into its own after we'd spent an entire week marching around exhibition halls in Vegas.
Priced at $129, the wearable is on sale at Spryng's official site.","If you wanted to simplify, CES 2019 could be neatly divided into self-driving cars, giant TVs and health tech.

"A.E. Dwyer on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Chicken stew on toast, however delicious, lacks sophistication. Now pour that stew into an elegant edible vessel? Thrilling. Crisp. Like a golden chalice of cream sauce. Now thats downright ladylike. The good news is even if youre not feeling particularly ladylike, this dish is scrumptious to all manner of persons. Meet Chicken à la Kinga dish so old, its new again.
According to The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Chicken à la King was not made for royalty, but rather the lunch set of Philadelphias fashionable Bellevue Hotel in the early 1900s. William King, a cook at the hotel, created the version that became his namesake, a dish that included truffle, red and green peppers. It was particularly appealing to the ladies who frequented the tea room, seen as a dainty dish that didnt require a knife to eat. Little did they know it contained about as many calories as a large cheeseburger.
My great-grandmother was a renowned family cook, who had attended The Antoinette Pope School of Fancy Cookery in Chicago. (Fun fact: Pope only charged 75 cents per class when she opened in 1930.) My great-grandmothers chicken creaming skills filtered down through her culinary education to my grandmothers dinner plate. And it stuck. After some tweaks, Chicken à la King became the default fancy dish made for Dwyer-family wedding buffets, elegant lunches, even the occasional Easter.
This recipe call for puff pastry shells, a nod to French pastry vol-au-vent: whisper-thin pastry cases used to contain rich bites of meats and creamed things. To me, they are a requirement to enjoying Chicken à la King, at least the first time around. The second day (when youre out of shells) youre allowed to go for a thick slice of toasted white bread. As kids, we would watch in awe as the pastry shellsor nests as they were marketed to usemerged from the oven, tall, golden and flaky. My sister and I managed to denude nest after nest of their small golden hats before we got caught.
The appearance of Chicken à la King is important: tender white meat chicken, silky white sauce, bright accent vegetables. No unsightly brown and grey bits of dark meat, nor even black pepper flakes, are allowed to besmirch the creamy whiteness. If you have it and you like it, use white pepper. Green peas add a fresh, sweet snap and pimentos add a subtle piquancy to the sauce. Drain those suckers wellwe dont want a pink tinted final dish, please.
Poaching in broth infused with carrot, celery, onion, peppercorn and thyme saves the chicken breast from being dry and flavorless. Bonus: Youll end up with tasty leftover stock, which can be chilled and frozen for soupy emergencies. 
Thickening with egg yolks became outmoded, when eggs were deemed pariahs for selfishly inflicting their cholesterol on our unwitting population. Now that yolks are cool again, I say bring them back as a thickener. Ill take my Vitamin D, lipids, and choline from yolks over canned soup goo any day.
So go ahead and make a fancy lunch for your friends. Make them my Chicken à la King, and put your best chicken foot forward.
1 package of Puff Pastry Shells (6 count), baked according to package instructions
For the chicken and poaching liquid:
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 bouillon cube or 4 cups chicken broth
1 small stalk celery, chopped in large chunks
1 small carrot, chopped in large chunks
1 wedge of onion, skinned
A few peppercorns or grinds of fresh pepper
A few thyme sprigs
Salt to taste
For the cream sauce:
1 stick of butter
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 cup whole or 2-percent milk
2 1/2 cups of reserved chicken poaching liquid
2 small jars of pimentos (2 oz. each), well drained
1 cup of frozen peas
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream
Salt to taste
Ground white pepper (optional)
Bring four cups of broth (or water with chicken bouillon cube added) to a simmer in a wide shallow pot with the lid. Add celery, carrots, onion, salt, pepper, and thyme and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and reduce heat to very low. After 15 minutes, check to see if chicken is cooked through, and remove the breasts from the broth. Continue cooking for another five minutes if chicken is not quite done yet.
Strain the broth and set aside 2 1/2 cups for your cream sauce. Discard the solids. 
Melt one stick of butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, then whisk in flour. Whisk thoroughly to combine, then let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally. Pour in milk and broth, and whisk to incorporate, making sure to whisk in any flour from the sides of the pan. Let cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Reduced the heat to keep the mixture warm.
In a bowl, combine the egg yolks and heavy cream, then slowly stir in 1/3 cup of the hot milk-broth mixture, mixing well. Pour this mixture back into your pot with the broth and whisk quickly to combine. This step will prevent the yolks from curdling. 
Cube your cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add chicken, pimentos, and peas to the broth mixture and stir, letting everything warm through. Taste and season with salt, adding a pinch of ground white pepper if desired.

Emily Price,"During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does. At some point during the conversation, it came out that I had never had a true Irish coffee. Seconds later they made sure I had one in my hand and I was hooked. In the United States, an “Irish Coffee” can mean anything from a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey in it to the real deal, but more often than not it falls somewhere in between. A traditional Irish coffee will typically be served in a small glass cup identical to the one in the photo above. It’s most often made with Jameson and sweetened coffee, and topped with chilled double cream (liquid cream, not whipped cream from a can) which can be tricky to get just right. I spent the past week in Ireland and my Irish Coffee dojo Martin demoed how to make the magic happen at one of the bars we stopped in at. You can check out my video of the demo below: Video: E.Price Given that I shot it in a crowded bar in not the most ideal way, I’ve also included a demo from Jameson proper which is a little different than what Martin showed me but is a little different. My written directions below are what I was taught and I think lead to a more authentic and tastier coffee, but you do you and adjust as needed. How to do it You want to start by warming your class up by pouring in hot water. If you’re using one of those fancy coffee glasses like I have above, you want to put a spoon inside the cup when you do this so you don’t break it. After you dump the water, fill the glass roughly 2/3 of the way full of coffee and then add some sugar. Jameson says to use 2 parts Demerara sugar and 1 part Muscovado sugar, Martin just used three spoonfuls of brown sugar. Yes, it’s a lot of sugar, but you need that amount not only to get the flavor right but also to ensure that your cream will float. Once you add the sugar give it a serious stir and make sure all of it dissolves, then add your whiskey. For a glass the size above, I used a shot of whiskey and a little extra for “good luck.” If you’re using a larger glass, by all means use more whiskey. Give the coffee another stir and then you’re ready for your cream. This was the most interesting detail for me. At home when I’ve tried to do this before I pour the cream in and it sinks to the bottom. Not what you want. That can happen when you don’t have enough sugar, but it’s also an issue if you screw up the pouring. For that, you want to rest your spoon right on the top of the coffee in your glass, so close that the bottom of the spoon is getting wet, but there isn’t any coffee inside the spoon. Then you slowly pour the cream into the spoon, allowing it to disperse across the top of your drink. The Jameson video above spoons a heavier cream over the top which also works, but doesn’t look as good in my opinion. If you want to go suuuuper easy you can also use canned whipped cream, but that’s pretty far from authentic and definitely not as tasty. If you have your spoon in the wrong spot, which is easy to do, then you just end up with cream throughout your glass. It’s still delicious, but definitely not as pretty. If you’re looking for a delicious treat this St. Patrick’s Day I definitely recommend giving an Irish coffee a try. You’ll thank me later.","During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does.

We Are The Mighty,"The F-35Bs lined up for takeoff on USS Wasp (LHD 1) are potent. Imagine if Wasp was hauling a full squadron of them. US Navy The US officially has 11 aircraft carriers, but it also has nine other ships that can serve as carriers in a pinch. Those are the eight Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and the single America-class vessel in service. But because the America and the Wasp were designed to haul Marines around, they're not going to perform as well as a full-scale carrier. How many carriers does the United States Navy have? Well, between the ten Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and the freshly commissioned USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the first of her class, you might think the answer is 11 — but you'd be underestimating. There are nine other ships in the fleet that can serve as carriers in a pinch. Those are the eight Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and the single America-class vessel in service. Their primary role, currently, is to carry about a battalion's worth of Marines and attachments, usually in conjunction with an amphibious transport dock, like USS San Antonio (LPD 17), and a landing ship dock, like USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41). But these massive ships are actually much more versatile. Just look at a ship like USS America. What does she look like? Well, there's a flat deck all the way down the ship and an island on the right. In fact, if you were to take a look at perhaps the greatest U.S. Navy ship of World War II, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV 6), you may notice a striking similarity. Looking at USS Essex (LHD 2) from behind, her resemblance to World War II aircraft carriers is undeniable. US Navy Today, USS America, as well as her Wasp-class predecessors, haul around the Air Combat Element of a Marine Expeditionary Unit. In Tom Clancy's 1996 book, Marine: A Guided Tour of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit was equipped with six AV-8B Harriers, twelve CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, eight CH-53E Sea Stallion helicopters, eight AH-1W Cobras, and three UH-1N Hueys for a deployment. That is a total of 37 aircraft. But imagine for a moment that you were able to mess around with the numbers a little. First, let's offload all of the helicopters. Instead, let's put an entire squadron of 15 Harriers on board, or offload the six Harriers in favor of a squadron of 16 F-35B Lightnings. Next, let's add about a dozen of the Navy's MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. And presto, you now have an air group on board that is outclassed only by the air groups on the French Charles de Gaulle and the U.S. Navy's Nimitz- and Ford-classes of carriers. Because the America and the Wasp were designed to haul Marines around, they're not going to perform as well as a full-scale carrier. They'll also have a much more limited capacity than their larger counterparts. But they could fill in somewhere in a pinch. In essence, they are ""backup carriers"" and you never know when having those backups might save America's butt.","US Navy The US officially has 11 aircraft carriers, but it also has nine other ships that can serve as carriers in a pinch.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","Dont forget! is one of those things I say to my daughter with gusto in my voice but fear in my soul.
 Dont forget to pack your music folder in your backpack for singing class this afternoon. 
Dont forget to put your laundry away. 
Dont forget to return your library books. 
Yeah, shes totally going to forget, I tell myself as she walks out of my sight. 
Im learning that dont forget is a waste-of-time command. As time management expert Leslie Josel explained on the Mighty Parenting podcast, Your brain is a muscle like every other muscle in your body. And just like every other muscle, it needs to be exercised. If you the parent are the one calling the shotsgo here at this time, go there at this time, dont forget your water bottle, dont forget your soccer bagthe only brain that is being exercised is yours.
Instead, you want to help your kids form their own connections. For younger kids, a simple question to ask is: How are you going to remember that?
Its a question that makes them pause, and then start coming up with solutionsa skill they will need to use all day, every day, for the rest of their lives. When you ask How are you going to remember that you need to meet me in front of school at 2:30 instead of 3 p.m. today? they might say they will write a note for themselves and put it in their folder. When you ask How are you going to remember to bring home the jacket you left at your friends house last time? perhaps theyll say they can put it in their bag as soon as they get there. 
With older kids and teens, Josel says she likes to ask, Whats your plan? Its softer, and sounds more like curiosity than nagging. She gives the example, Whats your plan to get that paper written because were going to grandmas for the weekend? 
What youre doing is youre helping them see time, she explains. Youre helping them see future time. All of a sudden, their brain is forced to actually think ahead. 
Maybe their plan will work, or maybe it wont. Your kids will probably forget things sometimes, face the consequences, and then hopefully come up with a better plan next time. What the shift in language does is detach you, the parent, from their daily triumphs and fails. Its now on them. And youve got more peace of mind as they walk away, figuring out their own lives.",“Don’t forget!” is one of those things I say to my daughter with gusto in my voice but fear in my soul.

Adam Rosenberg,"We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V. World War II setting. New cooperative mode. New approaches to progression and personalization. No more premium pass. SEE ALSO: 'Battlefield V' brings huge changes, but maybe not what you're expecting All sorts of good stuff. But there's a lot more to share from our three-hour call with DICE on Monday. Little things that would never make it as a back-of-the-box bullet point, but which still communicate so much about how this new Battlefield is different from all the past Battlefields. So here you go: 7 things you can do in Battlefield V that you couldn't before. 1. Build up your base Fortifications are a thing now! Every soldier hits the battlefield with a tool kit in hand. You can use that tool kit in set locations — especially around capture points — to build resupply stations, sandbag walls, barbed wire fences, tank deterrents, foxholes... you name it. 2. Stick with your squad Squads are elevated to a whole new level of importance in Battlefield V. You've always had the ability to respawn on squadmates, but now you can go a step further and actually see where they are and what they're doing from an over-the-shoulder perspective before you spawn back in. You know how you used to spawn in on a squadmate only to be gunned down seconds later? That should happen a whole lot less in Battlefield V. 3. Anyone can revive now, sort of Medics are still very much the go-to soldier class for players that like to heal. They can revive any downed soldier quickly, bringing them back to full health and ready to fight in no time. But medics aren't the only way to escape death. Squadmates also have the ability to revive one another, regardless of class. It'll take longer to do the revive than a proper medic, and your buddy won't come back with all their health. But it's something. Especially since.... 4. You can drag downed teammates to safety Great news for medics and helpful squadmates alike: When you see a teammate bleeding out on the ground, you can lend a hand and drag them off to a safe location before you get to work on reviving them. It's especially helpful for squadmate revives, since those take longer (unless you're a medic). But everyone should benefit from not being caught in a situation where you're gunned down immediately after being revived. 5. Squad leaders can do cool stuff if they lead well It's not new that Battlefield's squad leaders get some measure of control over their squaddies: When you're the leader, you can issue non-verbal orders that highlight a particular capture/defend point or some other objective. Battlefield V takes that leadership a step further by giving every squad leader a radio. As your squaddies follow orders and complete objectives, you earn points. Earn enough points and you can spend them, via the radio, on all sorts of bonuses: Supply drops, smoke screen barrages, heavy weapons and tanks, and even rocket strikes. 6. Stationary weapons are stationary no more Fixed weapon emplacements like anti-air or anti-tank turrets are no longer locked in one location. In Battlefield V you're able to connect them to an assortment of vehicles and drag them around, trailer-style. 7. Soldier classes can be further specialized Battlefield's four core classes — Assault, Support, Medic, and Recon — are all back in Battlefield V, but that's only where your customization begins. New archetypes allow you to tailor your preferred class for different types of battle conditions. DICE didn't go too heavily into the specifics here, but these archetypes come with skill trees that look like they offer a significant amount of control over how you progress.","We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V.

Alexis Nedd,"There’s a show on Hulu about women who are trying to survive in a patriarchal society. They dress in easily recognizable outfits. Better-situated people call them sluts or whores, and the men they have sex with are sometimes horribly violent and always transactional. The worst thing that could happen to these women is being sent to “the colonies,” but that’s only if they aren’t hanged first. It’s a fascinating look at the micro-worlds women create to protect themselves and their agency, and also there are at least nine towering, silly-looking powdered wigs per episode. Oh, right. Not that show. The other one. This one’s actually a lot of fun. SEE ALSO: Breaking down everything that happened in that shocking 'Handmaid's Tale' Season 2 finale Harlots on Hulu is about two warring brothels in Georgian-era London, each run by a formidable woman who straight up wants to murder the other. The first is Margaret Wells, whose working-class institution services men from all walks of life. Her nemesis is Lydia Quigley, a puffed up and powdered pseudo-lady whose pastel-toned mansion is a playground for blue-bloods and their ilk. Their beef is as old as Margaret herself, and the murder-filled, underhanded plots they hatch to take each other down makes the show less of a sex-filled period drama and more of a tale of two madam mobsters. Any show about prostitution is of course packed with sex, but Harlots — which is written and directed entirely by women — challenges audiences to view sex acts as transactional realities, much like their characters do. For example, in the first episode of Season 2, women working in Mrs. Wells’s house are all seen servicing customers but are more interested in overhearing a fight happening in the next room. Butts are bare and thrusting is occurring, but it’s rarely the most important thing that’s happening. Of the important things that do happen, the eight episodes of the show’s first season cover a lot. In addition to the Wells/Quigley rivalry, Harlots explores the interiority of the women who work in and outside of their houses. Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay (RIP Lady Sibyl) plays Charlotte Wells, Margaret’s oldest daughter who is contracted as the kept woman of a wealthy, spoiled nobleman. Charlotte wants to exit the family business not only for herself, but for her younger sister Lucy, whose virginity Margaret plans to sell now that she’s reached age (ugh) 15. There’s murder, blackmail, seduction, spies, a classic “let’s pretend this dead dude is just a stumbly drunk so we can dispose of his body” routine, human trafficking, and a few other subplots revolving around the lives of sex workers who don’t live in either of the two main brothels. It’s so rare to see a period drama that focuses on class-based modes of sex work, and the Georgian era’s rapidly changing social structure is an excellent backdrop for a story about women fighting for safety and comfort in a world that systematically denies them a chance at both. Come to Harlots for the costumes, fierce one-liners, and a heavy dose of pulp. Stay for the mob drama and girl power.","There’s a show on Hulu about women who are trying to survive in a patriarchal society. They dress in easily recognizable outfits.

Sam Rutherford,"At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs. But among Acer’s avalanche of metal and silicon, there was one device that felt like an anchor for the company’s growth and success: the new Chromebook Spin 13. For years, Acer has made some of the best Chromebooks you could buy, and with the new 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 13, Acer is keeping the newfound flexibility found on last year’s R13, while upping the ante with a new an all new, more premium feeling design. 1 / 5 Taking a cue from the Google Pixelbook, the Chromebook Spin 13 features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of a traditional 16:9 ldisplay. Then, Acer went and replaced the big long hinge on the R13 with a more standard two-sided setup, before tacking on a new one-piece Gorilla Glass touchpad. And unlike Acer Chromebooks of old couple years ago, the Spin 13 sports a full metal chassis that should give it some added durability and a touch of class. The Chromebook Spin 13 shouldn’t be hurting on power either thanks to your choice of 8th-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 CPUs, up to 16GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage. The Spin 13 even features built-in Wacom stylus support (including an onboard hidey hold for stashing the active pen when its not in use), so you can save handwritten notes or sketches with ease. But perhaps the best thing about the Chromebook Spin 13 is that it looks like its going to cost half the price of Google’s slick, but expensive $1,000 Pixelbook. Prices are going to start at $400 for a non-2-in-1 Chromebook 13, while the the 13 Spin will command a $100 premium on top of that. And just in case you wanted something slightly bigger, Acer is also making 15-inch versions of its new Chromebook, including the new $450 Chromebook Spin 15, which Acer claims is the world’s first 15-inch Chrome OS convertible.","At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs.

THOMAS B. EDSALL,"However often President Trump strays from his favored political strategy, he faithfully returns to it like a dog to a bone: first, polarize the American electorate along racial, cultural and economic lines, then exploit the schisms that have supplanted the class divisions that were once central to both American and European partisan politics.
On one side of the divide are those whom the political scientists Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehartdescribe in a 2016 paper as comfortable with an inexorable cultural escalator moving postindustrial societies steadily in a more progressive direction. This new direction amounts to what the authors call
an intergenerational shift toward post-materialist values, such as cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism, generating rising support for left-libertarian parties such as the Greens and other progressive movements advocating environmental protection, human rights, and gender equality.
On the other side, Norris and Inglehart write, is a counterrevolution, a
retro backlash, especially among the older generation, white men, and less educated sectors, who sense decline and actively reject the rising tide of progressive values, resent the displacement of familiar traditional norms, and provide a pool of supporters potentially vulnerable to populist appeals.
Economic distress, they argue, reinforces cultural alienation to produce fertile terrain for Trump. Fears of economic insecurity, including the individual experience of the loss of secure, well-paid blue-collar jobs, and the collective experience of living in declining communities of the left-behinds combine to make voters
more susceptible to the anti-establishment appeals of authoritarian-populist actors, offering simple slogans blaming Them for stripping prosperity, job opportunities, and public services from Us. 
The collision of these forces has produced the emergence of an American authoritarianism. In their book, Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit and Authoritarian Populism, which comes out later this week, Norris and Inglehart write that Trump has assumed leadership of this authoritarian movement,
defined as a cluster of values prioritizing collective security for the group at the expense of liberal autonomy for the individual. Authoritarian values prioritize three core components: 1) the importance of security against risks of instability and disorder (foreigners stealing our jobs, immigrants attacking our women, terrorists threatening our safety); 2) the value of group conformity to preserve conventional traditions and to guard our way of life (defending Us against threats to European values); and 3) the need for loyal obedience toward strong leaders who protect the group and its customs (I alone can fix it,"" Believe me, Are you on my team?"").
The United States and many European countries, at various points in the last decade, have reached a critical juncture, Norris and Inglehart write: The interwar generation, non-college graduates, the working class, white Europeans, the more religious, men and residents of rural communities have come to feel estranged from the silent revolution in social and moral values, left behind by cultural tides that they deeply reject. These men and women, until recently the politically and socially dominant group in Western cultures, reached
a tipping point at which their hegemonic status, power and privilege is fading. Their values make them potential supporters for parties and leaders promising to restore national sovereignty (Make America Great Again), restrict immigration and multicultural diversity (Build a Wall) and defend traditional religious and conventional moral values.
The debate over whether the rise of right-wing populism is driven by cultural anxiety, racism, ethnocentricity or economic deprivation may be somewhat artificial, Norris and Inglehart contend because
interactive processes may possibly link these factors, if structural changes in the work force and social trends in globalized markets heighten economic insecurity, and if this, in turn, stimulates a negative backlash among traditionalists toward cultural shifts. It may not be an either/or question, but one of relative emphasis with interactive effects.
In this country, the nominally class-based politics of the New Deal fractured when working class non-college whites felt abandoned by a Democratic Party that shed its pre-civil rights, segregationist southern wing and that by the 1970s had adopted a culturally and racially liberal agenda. Over the past five decades, these white voters have formed the core of the populist right. Conversely, minorities, many of whom face the same economic hardships as working class whites, if not worse, are firmly aligned with the party of social and cultural liberalism and racial equality, the Democratic Party.
The new cultural cleavage dividing Populists and Cosmopolitan Liberals, Norris and Inglehart write, is orthogonal to the classic economic class cleavage in other words, the new division cuts across and splits the old economic class solidarity.
Data from a preliminary American National Election Studies survey provided to me by Matthew DeBell, a scholar at Stanfords Institute for Research in the Social Sciences revealed the strength of this new cleavage. The survey asked 2,500 men and women to rank their feelings toward Trump on a feeling thermometer scale of zero, very cold or unfavorable, to 100, very warm or favorable.","Encouraging and exploiting division has worked for Trump, as far as his own electoral prospects are concerned.

JIM TANKERSLEY and ALAN RAPPEPORT,"Mr. Trump echoed that optimism, writing on Twitter that “we are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts” and that he looked forward to signing a final bill before Christmas. We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America. Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas! pic.twitter.com/gmWTny3SfS — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Dec. 2, 2017 The differences between the measures, though substantial, do not appear troublesome enough to prevent Mr. Trump from achieving that goal, which would be his first major legislative victory. Among the issues that will need to be worked out: Under the Senate bill, tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025 to mitigate the losses in revenue, and the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act would be repealed. The House bill does not have these provisions. The two versions also employ different methods to try to prevent multinational companies from shifting profits out of America and into lower-tax countries. In addition, the House bill would set a new 25 percent top tax rate for profits earned by small businesses and other so-called pass-through companies, while the Senate bill would give the owners of those companies a 23 percent deduction on pass-through income, which is taxed at rates for individuals. The House bill would eliminate the alternative minimum tax for corporations and individuals and eventually eliminate the estate tax. The Senate bill would maintain the corporate A.M.T. and trim, but not end, the individual A.M.T. and the estate tax. Still, the bills share much of the same architecture and many core elements. Each would cut the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Each would eliminate deductions for state and local income taxes, nearly double the standard deduction for individual filers, and reduce individual tax rates. Because of those provisions, both bills are projected to cut taxes initially for the bulk of middle-class taxpayers, yet raise them on millions of other middle-class families. The House bill would preserve a deduction for up to $10,000 a year in state and local property taxes. The Senate bill would, too, thanks to a last-minute change that helped gain the support of Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Lawmakers and lobbyists will battle furiously over the small details in a consensus bill, but party leaders show little worry that big issues will trip up the plan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said early Saturday that the House would move “quickly” to a conference committee. House members are planning to return to Washington on Monday, a day earlier than planned, to vote to proceed to conference. “Now it’s time to take the best of both the House and Senate bills, make them even stronger in a conference committee,” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a news release on Saturday, “and finalize one piece of legislation that will dramatically improve the lives of Americans for generations to come.” After the Senate vote, some ebullient Republicans seemed to hint that a conference might not even be necessary. “We’ll see,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, when asked if he thought the House might just take up the Senate’s bill. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, suggested that such a move by House Republicans was possible, but said, “That’ll be a question for House leadership.” A senior administration official, however, said on Friday night that that was not likely to happen. If Republicans do go to conference, the House and the Senate would each need to vote again to pass the package that resulted from those negotiations, before sending the bill to Mr. Trump. If the House were to simply approve the Senate bill, it would head to Mr. Trump straight away. Unable to stop or stall the bill, because Republicans are employing a process that allows them to bypass a legislative filibuster, Democrats were left to fume about the tax plan and the process by which it was speeding toward approval. Democrats charged that the Senate bill had been loaded with last-minute favors for the rich and the well-connected at the expense of the middle class, and complained that the text of the bill had been released only hours before the vote, with handwritten changes scrawled in the margins. Lobbyists saw a list detailing the changes before they did, the Democrats said. “Is this really how the Republicans are going to rewrite the tax code?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked in a floor speech before the vote. “Scrawled like something on the back of a napkin? Behind closed doors? With the help of K Street lobbyists? If that’s not a recipe for swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I don’t know what is.” As a group, Democrats seemed resigned to the fact that there was little they could do to stop the tax overhaul from being enacted. “My sense is they may have a conference in name only,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said after the vote. But Mr. Wyden predicted that Republicans would eventually regret their victory. “The American people are going to be stunned when they see what’s really in this,” he said.

VIRGINIA LÓPEZ GLASS,"By late 2017, the inflation rate exceeded 50 percent a month. It was a turning point: economist signaled that we were officially in hyperinflation. Inflation is bad, but hyperinflation is a totally different game. 
Hyperinflation hits the poorest the hardest. Venezuelans have reported losing on average 24 pounds in body weight. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. In the slums of Caracas, I visited mothers who have gone from reducing their childrens portions to having them skip meals altogether. 
Marilyn Alma, a mother of three, had to give up custody of her eldest child because she can no longer feed him. One week, a dozen eggs cost Alba three days of wages; the next week, the cost doubles. Eggs, the cheapest source of protein, are now a distant dream for the vast majority of people. Ms. Alma, who had once been a staunch government supporter, told me, Maduro betrayed this country. 
The professional class has also been affected. In middle-class neighborhoods large supermarkets previously stocked with imported goods are now half stocked with cheaper versions. Professionals can only afford two or three food items, and retirees often must leave behind products they can no longer afford. Their life savings and pensions are suddenly worthless.
Hyperinflation has also meant a brain drain. Young engineers or doctors are now working as waiters in Bogotá, Colombia, or as store clerks in Lima, Peru. The worst part is that they send back money to help us, Melani Delgado, whose two sons have left, told me recently as she fought back tears. A part-time dentist, Delgado said she could once afford to send her children to private university on her salary. Today remittancesare fast becoming a lifeline for those left behind. This government broke up the Venezuelan family and turned parents into parasites, she said.
If you belong to the dwindling minority that has access to dollars, you can somewhat offset the rise in prices with the surge in the black-market exchange. You may be able to survive, but its impossible to plan for something that changes every day. To adapt to the destruction all around you. 
For those with access to dollars, living with hyperinflation is demoralizing. At 6,000 bolívars (the equivalent of $2, or one third of the minimum monthly wage), a pound of butter is obscenely expensive. Paying $30 for a 17-ounce bottle of olive oil feels criminal. Today this bottle costs the equivalent of five times the minimum wage, but thats likely to change tomorrow. Beating the system feels like you are eviscerating your countrys economy.","Shoppers in Guaicaipuro, Venezuela, searched for food at a grocery store where nearly all shelves were empty because of massive food shortages plaguing the country last year.",2019-02-12T11:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Venezuela: A Nation Gripped by Hyperinflation,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/venezuela-hyperinflation-food-shortages.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/opinion/12Lopezglass/12Lopezglass-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
"RICHARD FAUSSET, SERGE F. KOVALESKI and PATRICIA MAZZEI","“Are you aware of the situation right now,” Daniel texted his mother, who speaks Portuguese. “What happened,” she texted back. “Alguma coisa na escola?” Something at school? And then: “Are you O.K.?” Six Harrowing Minutes It was Valentine’s Day. The morning and early afternoon had unfolded in a whirl of big balloons, stuffed animals and multicolored carnations from a $1 flower sale. The gay/straight student alliance encouraged students to sign “declarations of love.” Daniel, 17, a star on the varsity soccer team, had given his girlfriend chocolates in the parking lot before school. Just after 2 p.m., Mr. Cruz, 19, took a compact gold Uber car to campus. Mr. Cruz was texting from inside the car with a student at Stoneman Douglas, the son of a family that had taken him in after his mother died in November. Earlier that day, Mr. Cruz had texted: “I have to tell you something important soon.” Photo Left, messages between Daniel Medeiros, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, to his mother. Right, messages from Jackie McKenna to her mother, Tina McKenna. But when his friend asked what, Mr. Cruz did not explain. “Nothing man,” he wrote from inside the Uber, heading to the school where his friend was in class. His final text came at 2:18 p.m., a minute before the car dropped him off. “Yo,” he wrote. Then he entered the three-story Freshman Building, carrying an AR-15 in a soft black rifle case. Chris McKenna, a 15-year-old freshman, was trying to get to the bathroom in the building when he encountered Mr. Cruz in the stairwell. Mr. Cruz was loading bullets into his rifle. “He told me, ‘Better get out of here, things are about to get messy,’” Chris recalled. “I had no idea who he was.” At 2:21 p.m., Mr. Cruz began shooting into four classrooms. Moises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when the gunfire boomed. The students scurried to get as far away from the door as possible. Moises, who turned 18 on Friday, counted eight shots before the bullets shattered the glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who “wasn’t moving at all.” “She was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn’t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,” Moises said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Moises squeezed the hand of his sister’s best friend, who was bleeding from a bullet that grazed her knee. Another boy called 911. “I was too scared to look up, so I kept my head down, looking at the floor,” Moises said. “The shots were something I’ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time. If I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.” Photo Aaron Feis, left, an assistant football coach, and Scott Beigel, right, a geography teacher. Both men were killed trying to help students during the shooting. After his run-in with Mr. Cruz in the stairwell, Chris went out the closest door and told Aaron Feis, a football coach and security guard, what he had seen. Mr. Feis took Chris on his golf cart to a baseball field, about 500 feet away from the Freshman Building. “He said, ‘Stay here,’” Chris recalled. “So I stood there for a little bit, and then I heard shots go off, and from there I ran fast as I could to Walmart.” Other students later said Mr. Feis had died shielding people from gunfire. Inside the building, Mr. Cruz had moved to the second floor and shot someone in a classroom. Calls began streaming into 911. A description of the shooter went out over police radio: maroon shirt, black pants and a black hat, and carrying a black duffel bag and a black backpack. It was 2:24 p.m. Mr. Cruz climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Scott Beigel, 35, taught freshman geography. He had broken the class into small groups for a quiz game on Asian geography. Mr. Beigel had initially accompanied his class down to the second floor when the alarm went off. But as shots echoed through the hallways, he shepherded them back upstairs to take cover in the classroom. One of the last students to slip inside the classroom was Matthew Zeif, 14, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Seconds later, the room filled with smoky haze, Matthew remembered. He turned to see his teacher lying by the door, pale and bleeding. He had been shot before he could lock the door. As students pressed themselves against the wall, they worried that the gunman would enter the room. Haeseung, who had rushed into a classroom full of incredulous students, eventually heard an administrator on the intercom speaking in a serious tone he had never heard before: “He said, ‘evacuate the building right now.’ So I ran again.” He rushed outside to the bus loop, but teachers yelled at him to go back inside. He ended up in a counseling office with 50 other students, behind locked metal doors. Everyone was texting and calling friends and family. Haeseung sent numerous texts to his friend Ben Wikander, who had been in psychology class with him. Ben did not respond. According to news reports, he had been shot three times and underwent surgery on Thursday. Photo Students raised their hands as law enforcement entered their classroom. Credit via Reuters Mr. Cruz entered the third-floor stairwell at 2:27 p.m., dropped the rifle and backpack, and ran down the stairs, eventually blending in with the fleeing students. A Continuing Panic Students began streaming off campus, running for their lives. Others remained holed up in classrooms, storage areas and bathrooms, unsure what to do as their panicking parents rushed as close to the blocked-off school as they could get. Cellphones erupted with instructions, pleas for help and rumors. Andrew Gilroy, whose house is just behind the high school, received an alarming text from his 15-year-old son, William, a freshman, at 2:38 p.m. “I think theirs a shooter at school,” the text said. “We’re on lockdown. We’re in a closet.” Mr. Gilroy quickly responded: “OMG. Be smart.” William texted: “Do u hear sirens from our house?” Mr. Gilroy went outside and stood atop a berm in his backyard, peering at the school through trees and shrubs for any clues about what was happening. He had not heard any shooting. Mr. Gilroy wrote: “Not yet … Tell everyone to be quiet … Oxygen and air. Noise discipline.” William replied a few minutes later: “OK. I heard they got him but I don’t know.” William texted again, saying that his friend Eric and some others were coming to the house to seek refuge. “So u know.” Photo People embracing outside a Marriott hotel where students were taken after the shooting. Credit Mark Wilson/Getty Images William was still hiding in a closet in a classroom in the Freshman Building. About 10 students showed up at the house. Two of them were crying and badly shaken up. The teenagers wanted to stay outside and watch things develop at the school from afar. Mr. Gilroy insisted that they all go inside. “I’m thinking that the shooter could be coming through here or there may be more than one shooter,” he said. “I told the kids, ‘Come in the house. We are locking this down.’” Mr. Gilroy discreetly armed himself with a 9-mm handgun. “Just in case,” he said. After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart down the road and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald’s across the street. Then, as he strolled down a quiet residential street less than half a mile away, where a couple of people were walking their dogs, he was spotted by a police officer. Michael Leonard had been called in from the neighboring city of Coconut Creek for the emergency, but he decided to peel away from the mass of patrols of the school to comb the nearby streets. “He looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?” Officer Leonard said of Mr. Cruz. He wore a maroon shirt and black pants. The description matched. Officer Leonard pulled over. Mr. Cruz complied with orders and did not resist arrest. But the confusion and fear continued. Students still on campus waited long into the afternoon as the police swept the buildings and led them out. Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old senior who was hiding with fellow students in a classroom closet, shrank in terror when a SWAT team entered around 3:45 p.m. “I think every person’s heart stopped when we heard noise,” Delaney said. “We didn’t know if it’s someone coming to help you or to kill you.” From afternoon to late in the evening, the parking lot in front of a nearby Marriott, a designated pickup point for parents, was packed with police vehicles. Mothers and fathers arrived ashen-faced. Some left with relieved smiles, reunited with their children. By 9:30 p.m., foot traffic had slowed, save for a few Red Cross volunteers bringing water and snacks to parents who were still inside the hotel, still waiting.

Megan Rose Dickey,"In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees. This, of course, has been an ongoing conversation within the gig economy.
Those who work as 1099 contractors can set their own schedules, and decide when, where and how much they want to work. For employers, bringing on 1099 contractors means they can avoid paying taxes, overtime pay, benefits and workers compensation.
As Lyft notes in the S-1, this conversation has resulted in a number of lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and more.
“The tests governing whether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive,” Lyft states in its S-1. “Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful.”
In the event Lyft is forced to reclassify its drivers, that could result in a number of new financial burdens for the company. That includes:
Expense reimbursement
A potential injunction prohibiting Lyft from continuing its current business practices
Claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment
Monetary exposure relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages, and wage and hour law requirements
Lyft goes on to note that reclassifying its drivers as W-2 workers “may require us to significantly alter our existing business models and operations.” And this is one of those risks that could very easily happen.
As Lyft points out, it’s actively involved in six class-action lawsuits pertaining to driver classification. And the company has already settled a couple of lawsuits to the sum of $27 million in 2013, and $1.95 million in 2018. Meanwhile, California is actively examining this issue in Assembly Bill 5, which would improve protections and rights for gig economy workers. That bill was introduced in light of a groundbreaking state Supreme Court decision in April.","In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees.

Heather Alexandra,"Sega’s been giving out Yakuza games like candy, and I am not complaining. Last year, Yakuza Kiwami ’s remaster of the first game helped new fans experience an old class. Now, we have Yakuza Kiwami 2 and while not everything from the old game holds up, there’s still a lot to love. Set one year after Yakuza Kiwami, the story follows ex-yakuza and all-around nice guy Kazuma Kiryu as he gets dragged into a plot to destroy his former clan. Kiryu’s attempts to prevent all-out war lead him to team up with a tough female cop named Kaoru Sayama. Together, they bust a lot of skulls and learn a surprising secret about Sayama’s past. Per the Yakuza standard, the game is a mixture of open world exploration and arcade-style brawling. Yakuza Kiwami 2 expands the scope much more than Yakuza Kiwami did for its source material, adding new story perspectives and ramping up the graphics. Many people consider Yakuza 2 to be one of the best in the series. I’m not so sure about that, but it does benefit from a remaster far more than the first game. A new game engine—the Dragon Engine first used in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life— helps old locations feel as real as ever, and the the revamped cutscenes elevate the drama. Speaking of drama, the plot can get unwieldy. Yakuza Kiwami 2 feels weighed down by the sheer number of conspirators brought into the mix. Labyrinthine criminal plots are par for the course in this franchise, but other games like Yakuza 0 or Yakuza 4 used multiple protagonists to give the player the chance to naturally move from subplot to subplot until the storylines eventually connect. Yakuza Kiwami 2 stacks subplots on top of each other and has the player running around between set pieces that can feel random at first, and only later become clear. I kept thinking: Who am I fighting? Where am I going? It can be hard to tell, since the game doesn’t spend much time focusing on its cast outside of Kiryu and his core group of allies. As a result, the middle chapters felt bogged down by fetch quests and busy-work. Other Yakuza games have similar moments, but in those games, they have more narrative weight. Yakuza Kiwami 2 also isn’t as thematically consistent as this year’s other entry, Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, but its narrative has some of the most propulsive highs in the entire series. This is the story that solidifies Kiryu’s reputation as the ‘Dragon of Dojima,’ building his legendary status through a series of difficult battles. I felt surprised by the game’s difficulty and found myself thinking far more strategically in this game than in other titles. Over the course of playing, I adjusted to how the Dragon Engine handles combat, and I came to appreciate how rough and impactful each fight felt. Whether it’s a gauntlet fight sequence against no-name thugs or one of the many boss fights, Yakuza Kiwami 2 ’s harsh combat really complements the criminal drama. The game’s antagonist, Ryuji Goda, is the glue that binds everything together. Yakuza Kiwami spent time exploring the motives of its highly flawed antagonist By contrast, Goda is larger than life, more a force of nature than a man. He lights up the screen every time he appears. Kiryu and Goda are on a collision course, like a hurricane bearing down on a mountain. The game doesn’t let us learn much about Goda’s interior life compared to other villains, but he is charismatic and feels genuinely dangerous. The game’s middle chapters start to feel like a slog, but the climax between Goda and Kiryu is among the series’ finest moments and worth pressing on to see. Yakuza is not always about serious gangsters and bloody violence. It’s also about sidequests, mini-games, and spending time with familiar faces and places from the Yakuza world. In addition to the series staple of Kamurocho, Kiryu returns to Sotenbori, the fictional Osaka entertainment district from Yakuza 0. Each location features arcades and sidequests to distract the player from the game’s weighty plot, including a return of the absolutely incredible cabaret club management mini-game. More importantly, the game features an entirely separate story mode starring Yakuza 0 protagonist Goro Majima. This remaster takes the time to put its story into context and connect it to the rest of the series. Yakuza Kiwami 2 often feels like a direct sequel to Yakuza 0, with additional content that ties up loose story threads. In writing a guide to the series, I described Yakuza Kiwami 2 as skippable, and while I think that applies to fans who just want to hit the major beats of the series, I think that fans who hopped aboard the series with Yakuza 0 should hit this game up for Majima’s storyline alone. I can’t recommend the Yakuza series enough even if Yakuza Kiwami 2 can be a little tough to swallow at times. Every time I get to write about it for the site, I hope that readers will dive in and experience the various twists and turns of each game. There’s intrigue and drama, but also karaoke and mini-golf. Yakuza Kiwami 2 has some rough edges but features all the things that make the series great.","Sega’s been giving out Yakuza games like candy, and I am not complaining.

Ingrid Lunden,"Loan platform Kabbage — which offers quick assessment and approvals for small business loans using machine learning algorithms that pull data from dozens of sources — has closed another large securitization as it continues to grow its operations. The company said has closed an asset-backed securitization of $700 million, which it says it the largest transaction of its kind for an online lending platform focused on small businesses.
Valued at over $1.2 billion after raising a big round from Softbank in 2017, the company has been picking up momentum in recent years, through its own direct-to-business proposition as well as through white-label services and partnerships such as the recent deal it struck with Alibaba to offer loans to merchants buying on its platform.
Kabbage says it has now loaned more than $6.5 billion to over 170,000 small businesses on its platform since it was founded in 2009. The pace is accelerating for Kabbage: it loaned out $2 billion in 2018 and has already loaned out $600 million so far this year.
Kabbage — its name is a play on the slang word for “money” — has to date raised $940 million in debt funding, with some $4.2 billion in securities overall. As with a previous $500 million securitization it issued in 2017, this tranche is being issued by Kabbage Asset Securitization LLC, a fully-owned subsidiary of the company. (It has raised around $500 million in equity as well, with other backers in addition to SoftBank including BlueRun Ventures, Mohr Davidow Ventures, ING, Santander and more.)
Kabbage said that the majority of the proceeds from this $700 securitization is being used to pay down “an existing asset-backed securitization transaction” (it doesn’t specify which). But the generally strong outlook for the company on its basic business model has meant that the terms under which Kabbage borrows continue to improve, meaning the terms under which it has to pay back the money also continue to get more favorable.
It notes that the most senior class of the five-tranche transaction earned a AA(sf) rating from Kroll Bond Rating Agency, “the highest ABS rating earned by a small business online lending platform for a three-year facility,” and that the transaction reduces the companys cost of funds compared to its existing ABS by more than 100 basis points.
The new ABS and AA(sf) rating is a testament to Kabbages proven and real-time approach to responsibly provide credit access to small businesses, said Kabbage CFO Scott Rosenberg in a statement. The new transaction positions the company for continued milestone growth as small businesses accessed more than $2 billion through Kabbage last year and more than $600 million already in the first quarter of 2019.",Loan platform Kabbage — which offers quick assessment and approvals for small business loans using machine learning algorithms that pull data from dozens of sources — has closed another large securitization as it continues to grow its operations.

"Nicole Dieker on Two Cents, shared by Nicole Dieker to Lifehacker","How much is your side hustle currently bringing in? How much do you think itll earn this year, based on your first-quarter revenue?
(Ill wait while you do the math.)
Next question: how much are you spending on your side hustle? Is it more or less than what youre earning?
Gross income is great, but the new tax laws have gotten a lot stricter on whether you can deduct those expenses youre racking up as you pursue your side hustle. This means that if your side hustle isnt hustling up a profit, you might have to classify it as a hobbyand lose out on potential tax savings.
Freelancers and side hustlers: how much money do you want to make this year?
Read more Read
The basic business vs. hobby rules are still the same: to qualify as a business, you need to make a profit in three out of the past five years. To quote IRS Publication 535: 
An activity is presumed carried on for profit if it produced a profit in at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. 
(Theres an exception for people who breed, show, train, or race horsesthey only have to show a profit for two out of the last seven years, probably because horses are expensive.)
If your side hustle qualifies as a business, youll report your income and expenses on a Schedule C and will be able to deduct qualified business expenses from your taxes. That also remains unchanged.
However, taxpayers used to be able to itemize and deduct some hobby expenses from their taxes as well, even if their money-making endeavor didnt qualify as an official small business. As The Washington Post reports, the new tax laws have eliminated that deduction:
In the past, you could claim hobby expenses as part of the class of miscellaneous itemized deductions that needed to exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income, [IRS spokesperson Eric Smith] said. But that category of deductions was eliminated under tax reform.
Previously, you could deduct expenses from a hobby up to the income it generated as personal itemized deductions, as long as you met the 2 percent threshold. However, starting in 2018 and up until 2025, this deduction is no longer allowed.
What does that mean for you? If your side hustle has more expenses than income, and you havent earned a profit in three out of the past five years, youll have to classify it as a hobby.
If you are starting a side hustle and it hasnt made a profit yetbut you think it might earn a profit in three out of the next five yearsyou can file IRS Form 5213, Election To Postpone Determination as To Whether the Presumption Applies That an Activity Is Engaged in for Profit.
(If youve read all of this and feel more confused than when you started, you can always hire a CPA or tax preparer to help you.)
Most importantly: if your side hustle isnt bringing in any profit, you can start cutting business expenses or working on growing your income. Do it for the sake of your businesss bottom lineor your own bottom line, because that money youre spending on an unprofitable business is probably coming out of your own pocketand do it for the sake of your tax return.
Or, you could always accept that your side hustle is really a side hobby. Not every hobby has to become a full-fledged business, after all.

Kate Clark,"SurveyMonkey, which helps businesses gather feedback through its survey platform, has submitted paperwork to the SEC for its upcoming NASDAQ public offering. The company plans to raise $100 million in the IPO, per the filing, though that’s likely a placeholder amount. The company, which will list under the symbol SVMK, has yet to price its shares. Most recently, SurveyMonkey brought in $250 million from Tiger Global, ICONIQ Capital and Social+Capital Partnership. The financing valued the company at $2 billion. SurveyMonkey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. At the ripe age of 19, San Mateo, Calif.-based SurveyMonkey has been prepping an IPO for years now, finally filing confidentially with the SEC via the JOBS Act, which lets companies test the waters before they formally release an S-1, in mid-June. Despite its age, the company still isn’t profitable. SurveyMonkey reported a net loss of $27.18 million on $121 million in revenue in the first half of 2018. During the same period last year, it had a $19 million net loss on $106.5 million in revenue. In all of 2017, SurveyMonkey posted a $24 million net loss on $219 million in revenue. The filing lists J.P. Morgan as the lead underwriter for the IPO. The online polling company has raised some $600 million across several rounds of equity funding from investors, including Tiger Global, which owns a 29.3 percent pre-IPO stake. Its board includes Serena Williams and Sheryl Sandberg. Sandberg’s late husband Dave Goldberg was the founder and former CEO of the company; he passed away in 2015. She owns 10,318,577 shares, but plans to “donate all shares beneficially owned by her (or the proceeds from the sale thereof) to the Sheryl Sandberg and Dave Goldberg Family Foundation as part of fulfilling their philanthropic commitment to the Giving Pledge,” the filing states. SurveyMonkey joins a herd of unicorns that have announced plans to transition into the public sphere this year. Eventbrite, for example, submitted its IPO paperwork last week, with plans to raise $200 million from selling Class A shares. Smartsheet, Zuora, Dropbox and DocuSign have all completed their public debuts this year.","SurveyMonkey, which helps businesses gather feedback through its survey platform, has submitted paperwork to the SEC for its upcoming NASDAQ public offering.

BEN BRANTLEY,"“The Ferryman,” a London import that picked up most best play awards on offer there, is largely set in a cozy Irish farmhouse overflowing with a multigenerational abundance of family. (The cast numbers more than 20, not counting livestock.) But since its author is the perpetually surprising Jez Butterworth (“Jerusalem”), whose plays are never what they initially seem, a mortal chill is soon felt amid the hearthside warmth. The discovery of a corpse links the head of the household to his past life as a member of the Irish Republican Army, and the arrival of highly unwelcome, quite possibly homicidal visitors is imminent. Staged by Sam Mendes, this production pulsed so vigorously with plot, suspense and life itself that when I saw it in London last year, its more than three hours seemed to pass in one deep gulp of a breath. Featuring its excellent original stars, Laura Donnelly (whose family’s history partly inspired the plot) and Paddy Considine, “The Ferryman” begins previews on Oct. 2 at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater. The upper-middle-class African-American family of Patricia Ione Lloyd’s “Eve’s Song,” which begins previews on Oct. 21 at the Public Theater, finds that affluence offers no insulation against the violence regularly perpetrated in this country against women of color, especially those who are transgender or lesbian. The ghosts of the victims of such crimes creep into the house of the newly divorced Deborah, whose daughter has recently come out. Jo Bonney (“Mlima’s Tale”) directs this serious comedy, which Ms. Lloyd has tantalizingly described as “a queer female version of ‘Get Out.’”","Paddy Considine and Genevieve O’Reilly as Quinn and Mary Carney, the parents of a large and boisterous brood, in “The Ferryman.”",2018-09-07T08:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","It May Be Home, but It’s No Sanctuary",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/theater/new-plays-politics.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/16/arts/16season-brantley1/16season-brantley1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
Kevin Billings,"It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall. For students, that means hearing the three words they fear the most: ""back to school."" Whether it's heading to college at the end of August or high school after labor day, education is going to be the priority again. SEE ALSO: 20 things you need to survive life in a college dorm If there is a silver lining to this time of year, it's all the back to school sales that have or are going to start in the coming weeks. Whether you need basic class supplies or have to load up for a dorm, everything you could possibly need will be on sale. That also means it's the perfect time for anyone looking to get a new laptop. The right laptop is essential. Luckily, finding a good laptop on sale at this time of year is not a difficult task. Here are some of the best deals right now: The best thing about Chromebooks are their simplicity. These are computers designed for some light web surfing and getting work done and not much more than that. The Samsung XE500C13-S03US is the perfect example of that simple and reliable design. It sports 2GB of RAM with a 16GB SSD, which doesn't sound like a lot, but makes it perfect for school work. And with an 11-hour battery life, you'll be ready to go for those long class days and study sessions. If you need something that might be a little bit faster, then the HP Chromebook 11 G5 could be the laptop for you. On the whole, the HP Chromebook isn't much different from the Samsung Chromebook mentioned above, both sporting the Celeron processor and a 16GB SSD for storage. However, you do get 4GB of RAM with this model from HP, which will provide a nice boost in performance for anyone who needs a little extra oomph out the Chromebook. While regular Chromebooks are always useful, sometimes there's a need for a little more flexibility. To that end, the ASUS Chromebook Flip provides that flexibility with a 2-in-1 design. At a technical level, it's on par with the previously mentioned Chromebooks with 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage for reliable performance. But, as the name implies, the screen can flip for anyone who may need a tablet in a pinch. That sort of flexibility can be a welcome addition, especially in the classroom. As reliable as Chromebooks can be, some classes and school needs may demand more out of your computer. Thankfully, there are laptops that can provide that power without breaking the bank, and Lenovo provides that with the 320-15. Under the hood, the Lenovo sports 6GB of RAM for faster performance and a 1TB HDD, so it doesn't skimp on storage. That extra space is especially useful for those semesters where it seems like you have a paper due every week. Dell is one of the biggest in the game. Because of that, there are certainly plenty of choices available under the Dell banner. And for the average student looking for an above average computer, the Inspiron 15 is the laptop to check out. The Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 is perfect for anyone who needs a killer laptop/tablet combination. And with 8GB of RAM and, again, a 1TB HDD, it delivers flexible power on a budget. This is the alternative to the 2-in-1 mentioned above, more suited for anyone looking for a more traditional laptop out of the Dell Inspiron 15. At a technical level, it's nearly identical as the aforementioned Dell 2-in-1. However, while the 2-in-1 sports the IntelR Core i3, this one has the AMD Ryzen 5, which has emerged as a viable alternative to the Intel line of processors that have dominated the market. And given AMD's background in the games space, the Ryzen processor reflects that with an extra bump in power. If you like the Chromebook, but wish it had a little extra power behind it, Google has just the thing to scratch that itch in the Pixelbook. The Pixelbook offers the flexibility of the basic Chromebooks with specs on par with laptops similar to the aforementioned Dell computers. For example, it uses the Chrome OS and sports an Intel Core i5 processor, highlighting the balance between simplicity and power the Pixelbook offers. And with a 2-in-1 design, it's yet another laptop bolstered by some excellent physical flexibility. All that makes for a laptop that, if you're going into your freshman year at college, will provide longevity. Those are just a few of the laptops you can on sale right now. As the start of the year gets closer and closer, more deals will hit and more laptops will be available at excellent prices. Just keep you're ear to the ground and your browsers locked to Amazon, Walmart, and others for more deals.","It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall.

Devin Coldewey,"Virgin Galactic is celebrating the third successful supersonic test flight of VSS Unity, the passenger spacecraft it intends to make available for space tourism in the near future. This flight took the craft higher and faster than ever, stressing the system and providing useful data for the rocket plane’s engineers. Virgin’s two-part flight system uses a traditional jet-powered plane, the WhiteKnightTwo-class VMS Eve, to carry the spacecraft up to about 45,000 feet, after which the latter detaches and zooms ahead (and upward) on rocket power. Each of Unity’s flights has pushed its specs a bit further: The first one, in April, achieved Mach 1.6 and just over 84,000 feet of altitude. The second, in May, hit Mach 1.9 and reached 114,500 feet. Today’s went to Mach 2 and got up to 170,000 feet, touching the Earth’s mesosphere before gliding down to a soft landing. It’s still not nearly to space; the Karman Line, where space “officially” begins, is about twice as high. But at this rate it sure just seems like a matter of time before they get up there. Importantly, the rocket powering Unity’s flight burned this time for 42 seconds, well over the 30 seconds or so it’s been fired for until now. These tests necessarily have to advance degree by degree, but going from 30 to 42 is a big jump that the engineers are probably thrilled about. “Having been a U2 pilot and done a lot of high altitude work, or what I thought was high altitude work, the view from 170,000 feet was just totally amazing,” said one of the pilots, Mike “Sooch” Masucci, in a Virgin Galactic press release. “The flight was exciting and frankly beautiful. We were able to complete a large number of test points which will give us good insight as we progress to our goal of commercial service.” The team is working on analyzing the data from this flight, and of course inspecting and tweaking the spacecraft, and we can probably expect another test flight in the next few months.","Virgin Galactic is celebrating the third successful supersonic test flight of VSS Unity, the passenger spacecraft it intends to make available for space tourism in the near future.

"Nick Leggin on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","My family heads to Wisconsin every year for my dad and stepmothers Saturday-after-Thanksgiving dinner. Most of their stepchildren are between families Thursday and Friday, so the Saturday event gets a high turnout. The foods pretty good too, so that may be another reason. Like REO Speedwagon at a casino auditorium, this dinner plays the hits: turkey, gravy, marshmallow-topped sweet potatoes, two kinds of stuffing, and a phalanx of dinner rolls. Occasionally a Jell-O salad or vegetable will make a cameo. For me, the star attraction is the unique spin on mashed potatoes. To be sure: I love potatoes in all forms. Theyre easily my favorite food. Mashed, baked, roasted, chips, refried after mashingbring them all to my plate in endless quantities, thank you. Even to a potato-lover, these mashed potatoes still belong in a class to themselves. They are not a Wisconsin delicacy (Im not aware of other families that do what my stepmom does) but I cannot imagine a recipe like this emanating from another state in the union. What makes these different from standard turkey-day potatoes? Imagine a twice-baked potato without the shell. There are four varieties of dairy in the dish: cream cheese, sour cream, butter, and sharp cheddar cheese (amazingly, no milk!). Theres a generous amount of bacon. When baked, the potatoes get a crispy, caramelized outer crust. This is a departure from traditional mashed potatoes, and I understand any skepticism. But I contest that the dish embodies many traits of a great Thanksgiving side. These potatoes taste awesome with turkey, as well as with gravy, which offers a savory counterbalance to their cheesy tang. Theyre not ruined when the errant cranberry makes their way into the potato pile on your plate. For the leftover fiends among us, they hold up well to reheating the following day. This recipe requires strength. One must have Lincoln Hawk -like forearms to fold in all the ingredients prior to baking. It yields a gallon of potatoes. My stepmom doubles the recipe (two gallons!), which is enough to serve two dozen people and allows for plenty of leftovers. At our Thanksgiving, the double batch of potatoes are served in a container the size of a porch planter. These potatoes also take patience. If youre making these the day ahead, plan for at least 90 minutes of oven time for reheating. Separating into smaller dishes will speed up this process. If you say Thanksgiving in Wisconsin, nothing is probably more on-the-nose than a cheese-heavy side dish. Few things draw my ire like lazy mockery of Wisconsinites and their love of dairy. When it comes to this dish, Ill set the ire aside, and take another scoop of potatoes. 5 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled 10 oz. bacon, sliced into small strips 8 oz. cream cheese 1 1/2 sticks of butter 1 cup sour cream 2 chives, chopped very fine 2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 2 tsp. kosher salt 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper Slice the bacon into 1/4-inch strips, and cook until slightly brown. Drain fat and set aside. Peel the potatoes and cut into quarters. Boil until tender, then drain. Using a ricer, mash potatoes into a thin layer back in a very large mixing bowl. Place about a third of the butter and cream cheese on top of the layer. Alternate layers of riced potatoes with the butter and cream cheese. Use the sturdiest wooden spoon you have to incorporate the cup of sour cream. Then fold in the in the cheddar cheese, bacon, and chives. Grimace occasionally while your hand cramps, then get right back to it. Grease a large, oven-safe pot; I use a 7.5 quart Dutch oven. Pour the potatoes into the cooking vessel. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. About 30 minutes in, check to see if the sides started browning. You can scrape down the sides with a wooden spoon and stir the brown bits into the mix, to avoid burning and introduce more deliciousness. Bake for 30 more minutes.","My family heads to Wisconsin every year for my dad and stepmother’s Saturday-after-Thanksgiving dinner.

"mgokey@businessinsider.com (Malarie Gokey), Malarie Gokey","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Samsung/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Sometimes the storage that's built into a device just doesn't cut it — That's where microSD cards come in to expand your device's storage. Many Android smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support microSD cards, as do all GoPro action cameras and some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Whether you need a microSD card for your smartphone, action camera, mobile-gaming console, or something else entirely, we've got the microSD card for you. Before we get into our top picks, here are all the terms and specifications you need to know to buy the right microSD card for your device. Card Type and capacity When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically pack 64GB to 2TB. Although most devices accept the SDXC standard for microSD cards with 32GB or more, some devices still only accept lower capacity SDHC microSD cards. Some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo 3DS only support SDHC cards for 32GB or less. Most phones support SDXC cards with 64GB or more. Be sure to check which format your device supports. Speed Class SD Association Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below. SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s. It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll want a class 10 microSD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification. UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s. Finally, there's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card. All the microSD cards in this guide are U3 or U1. App performance class for smartphones and tablets The App Performance Class denotes which MicroSD cards are best for smartphones and tablets. An A1 rating means that the card can open apps and process apps quickly, because it can handle a random read input-output access per second (IOPS) of 1,500 and write IOPS of 500. A1 cards are new, and anyone who wants to use Google's ""Adoptable Storage"" feature, which formats your card as internal storage in an Android device, should look for the new rating. The right microSD card for your device Depending on what you're using your microSD card for, you'll want a different capacity. For smartphone users: A 16GB or 32GB SDHC microSD card is fine for most smartphone users, because you'll probably be using it to store photos, videos, and big mobile games. You shouldn't fill up a 32GB card too fast. If you like to shoot 4K video on your phone, then you have to buy an SDXC microSD card that has a U3 speed class rating and at least 64GB of storage. Many phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support SDXC microSD cards with up to 256GB of storage. For the Nintendo Switch and 3DS: Thankfully, the Nintendo Switch accepts SDXC microSD cards with up to 2TB of storage onboard. Since games take up a ton of storage, we recommend you get a high-capacity card for your Switch. If you have a Nintendo 3DS, you cannot buy an SDXC card. The console only supports SDHC cards with 32GB or less storage. For GoPro users: If you need a microSD card for your GoPro, consult the company's list of recommended cards. The site says that GoPros require a minimum of Class 10, but U1 or U3 are better speed classifications. The HERO camera only supports a 32GB SDHC microSD card, but the HERO 3 Black Edition, HERO 3+, HERO+, and HERO+ LCD cameras support SDXC microSD cards with up to 64GB of capacity. Meanwhile, the HERO 4 and HERO Session cameras are compatible with SDXC microSD cards of up to 128GB. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links.

JAMES BARRON,"Mr. Elegudin said the agency was reviewing its maintenance practices. “The truth is, some of the elevators that were installed early on aren’t as reliable and don’t provide the diagnostics we need,” Mr. Elegudin said. “There is nothing worse than getting to a station and finding the elevator is not working.” He said it had happened to him. “You’re literally stuck in our system,” he said. The transit agency is facing three lawsuits about accessibility (the center that Ms. Amari works for is a plaintiff in one, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan; the others were filed in federal court). A spokesman for the agency said it did not comment on litigation. Separately, he noted that transit facilities built before the federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the 1990s “are generally not required to be made accessible.” Joe Rappaport, the executive director of the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, an organization bringing one of the suits, said the transit agency needed to be required to live up to Mr. Byford’s promises. “Andy Byford’s successor or the successor after that may not have the same commitment,” he said. For now, the challenges persist. April Coughlin, a transit advocate and college professor who uses a wheelchair, anticipated problems on a recent afternoon when she took the R train to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. Since early morning, the app on her cellphone had said the elevator at DeKalb Avenue was not working. It wasn’t when she arrived around 3:15 p.m. The sign promised it would be fixed by 5 p.m. (someone had crossed out 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.). But Ms. Coughlin was due at Long Island University to teach a class that began at 4:30 p.m. “How do I get to work?” she asked on the platform, deep underground with no way to get to the street. “The building is literally outside.”","Gabriela Amari, using a subway elevator, must take a circuitous route to work because the station she lives near is not accessible.

Whether you're an amateur who's learning, a pro who shoots in RAW all the time, or a videographer who films in 4K, we've got you covered. Card Type When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically range from 64GB to 2TB. Capacity Chances are, you'll want an SD card with more than 32GB of storage, so you'll be looking at SDXC cards. A 32GB card is fine for casual photographers or people who prefer to have multiple smaller-capacity cards for security (if you lose your card, you don't lose everything). We typically recommend 64GB cards in this guide because you'll want that extra space for high-resolution photographs and video. Speed Class SD Association Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below. SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s. It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are shooting in RAW or filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll want a class 10 SD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification. UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s. The SD Association also has a new UHS-III standard that supports 360-degree, 3D, 4K, and 8K. Read and write speeds will theoretically be 624 MB/s for UHS-III cards — That's double what UHS-II cards are capable of. However, this type of card isn't yet widely available or able to function in current hardware, so it's just something to look forward to. There's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card. All the SD cards in this guide are U3 or U1. Video Speed Class The SD Association also classifies cards by a video speed class standard, which currently ranges from V6 to V90. Check out the SD Association's chart below to see what each of the classifications means in terms of what kind of video you can shoot. SD Association The Association also has a helpful video explainer on YouTube. Our top pick carries the V30 video speed class badge, which is great for shooting 4K video. You'll want to check to be sure your camera supports those speeds. Otherwise, you won't get the full effect of the card. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links.

Jonathan Stempel,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) on Saturday reported a record quarterly and annual profit, benefiting from a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Fourth-quarter net income increased roughly fivefold to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate fell 24 percent to $3.34 billion from $4.38 billion. Berkshire attributed roughly $29.11 billion of its net income to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate, to 21 percent from 35 percent, that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Book value per Class A share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, was $211,750 at the end of the year, up 13 percent from three months earlier. This also benefited from the tax law change. For all of 2017, Berkshire’s net income rose 87 percent to $44.94 billion. Operating profit, however, fell 18 percent to $14.46 billion, hurt by a rare loss from insurance underwriting. Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $304,020.01 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $202.76. Both are up a little over 2 percent this year, but are down nearly 7 percent from their record highs set on Jan. 29.

"MITCH SMITH, JESS BIDGOOD and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS","For the moment, it appears Michigan State has avoided a loss of new students. The university expects to enroll its largest-ever freshman class this fall, and said this month that the number of admitted students who had paid enrollment deposits was 2 percent higher than that of a year ago. But the full effects of the blow to the university’s reputation may not be felt until next year. “Michigan State has a long road ahead,” said Michael Gordon, a principal at Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis communications firm in New York. “I think so far they have really failed on talking about how as an institution, they will change culturally and change how they do business.” The $500 million settlement has largely been welcomed as a necessary step by Michigan State students and alumni who are disgusted by Dr. Nassar’s conduct. Sydney Ewing, 18, is preparing to head to Michigan from Texas in the middle of the summer to start her coursework early, and to train with the gymnastics team, which she committed to join last fall. She said she has often thought of the scandal, but never doubted her decision to join the team. “The settlement is incredible,” Ms. Ewing said, adding that the agreement helped restore trust in the school’s administration. “After this settlement, I do believe in them.” But it also raises uncomfortable questions. Victoria Vander Velde, 18, who will enroll at Michigan State in the fall, received a text message from another freshman-to-be on Thursday about whether their tuition might rise as a result of the settlement.",The university reached a $500 million agreement with women abused by Dr. Lawrence G.

Monica Chin,"I am a lifelong economy flier. I am all too familiar with the common man's grind of air travel: 20 minutes standing in line, trudging through crowded aisles, hoisting heavy bags into tiny compartments, and squeezing past grumpy people into hard, narrow seats. Recently, however, I got a chance to see how the other half flies — in Qatar Airways ' Qsuite, the first ever business-class suite to include doors and a double bed. It's an experience reviewers have called the best business-class seat in the world, from the airline Skytrax has named as the world's best business-class airline. It comes at a price: A business class flight from JFK to Doha on Qatar Airways could cost as much as $7,000. SEE ALSO: Qatar Airways Flight Escorted to Manchester Airport After 'Hoax Bomb Threat' The Qsuite made its U.S. debut in December in aircrafts at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, and Qatar Airways is now in the process of rolling it out nationwide. I received a tour of one of the newly outfitted aircrafts, and a brief mock ""flight"" while it was grounded. The Suite The business-class cabin was outfitted in soothing, but futuristic colors: grey, red, burgundy, in various hues. Qatar Airways Vice President for the Americas Günter Saurwein told me that the cabin's designers aimed to combine modern western influences with a more traditional middle-eastern style. The lights faded between colors like a slowed-down disco ball, red to orange to purple, dark blue, lime green, and back again. At times, the cabin's aura was reminiscent of a dimly lit, classy restaurant. A single Qsuite under red lighting Image: monica chin/mashable Two Qsuites combine into one with a double bed. Image: monica chin/mashable The airline claims the Qsuite is the first business-class suite to feature a double bed. That's technically true, but it's slightly misleading. Each Qsuite has a total of of one seat, which can be folded down into a twin bed. The suites located in the middle of the cabin (as opposed to beside the window) are placed next to each other, and walls between them can be pulled down to create one large suite. The two twin beds, side by side, create a double bed, with a slight gap and two sets of bedding. So you'd need to buy two Qsuites to have a double bed to yourself — but it's a good option for couples. Qsuites are arranged in a 1-2-1 formation, so every passenger has direct aisle access. Image: monica chin/mashable Being a solo traveler, I opted for a twin suite beside a window. I entered through a door the height of my shoulder, which I could open and close with ease. The seat was quite comfortable, and a control panel next to it featured about a million buttons to customize settings from incline and height to lumbar support. I left it alone to start. Awaiting me in my suite were a soft blanket, several decorative pillows, pajamas from The White Company, over-ear headphones, and a toiletry kit from Bric's with higher-quality toiletries and earplugs than I've ever owned. (I never actually put on the pajamas during the flight, but I've worn them since, and they're quite comfortable.) Beside the seat were an Ottoman-style storage unit and a hook for my jacket. I was ready to ""fly."" The Flight Once we were settled in, the cocktails came out. Qatar Airways serves — and I don't say this lightly — the best drink I have ever had in my life. It's a non-alcoholic mixture of mint, sugar, and lime juice, and I am positive it's served in heaven. I had three over the course of the flight. Armed with red lighting, a Qsuite, and a delicious drink, I was ready to fly. Image: monica chin/mashable Next came the food. Everything on the menu looked delicious, and I felt the agony of indecision beginning to descend upon me. That was for naught, however: It turned out I would be served everything. The meal had three courses, along with a la carte snacks. The food was delicious, and by far the best part of the flight. In keeping with the fusion theme, the Qsuite's menu blends middle-eastern staples with Western fare. The first course of our meal included delicious bread, and biryani, and a tablecloth. Image: monica chin/mashable We received artisan breads with hummus, a chicken biryani with fried onions and toasted nuts, a wild mushroom ravioli, and a fluffy chocolate cake with figs. We also got a large snack platter including beef sliders, mini chili con carne tacos, and mini strawberry cheesecake cupcakes. I ate everything, and have no regrets — it was delicious. Wine was served throughout, and a friendly flight attendant asked if I needed anything every 15-20 minutes. Yeah, the bathroom is nice. Image: monica chin/mashable The bathroom was shiny with marble-looking countertops, and included hand soaps and sanitizers that were unlabeled, but smelled ravishing. It was a far cry from the cramped, pungent quarters that are a staple of economy cabins. The most disappointing part of the flight was the entertainment. The TV itself was much larger than one you'd see on an economy flight, and it featured games, movies, music, and TV shows, but all in limited quantities. I occupied myself by watching the one available episode of Cooks vs. Cons, in very high quality, several times over. Hey, it was a good episode. Image: monica chin/mashable Finally, I fiddled with my seat's control panel until it eventually folded all the way back. I spread out my bedding, put on the absurdly soft sleep mask I'd been provided, and lay down. Sleeping on the Qsuite's seat wasn't quite like sleeping on a mattress, but it was close enough. While atop the makeshift bed, listening to the low murmur of voices, the tap of utensils, clinking of glass, and cordial laughs of the flight attendants waiting on customers hand and foot, I couldn't help but consider the absurdity of it all. The fact that the same aircraft can serve as both an annoyance to be endured for some (like me) and a chance for others to be pampered beyond belief. The fact that to those able to shell out many thousands on transportation, such an experience may not be a luxury, but rather a continuation of a status quo unimaginable for most. The fact that those people and I fly through the same sky, in the same groundbreaking hunks of metal. That said, if I win the lottery tomorrow, am I flying in the Qsuite forever more? You bet your ass.","I am a lifelong economy flier.

Jonathan Shieber,"Over the next twenty years the autonomous vehicle market is expected to grow into a $700 billion industry as robots take over nearly every aspect of mobility. One of the key arguments for this shift away from manually operated machines is that they offer greater safety thanks to less risk of human error. But as these autonomous vehicles proliferate, there needs to be a way to ensure that these systems aren’t exposed to the same kinds of hacking threats that have bedeviled the tech industry since its creation. It’s the rationale behind Regulus Cyber, a new Israeli security technology developer founded by Yonatan Zunger and Yoav Zangvil — two longtime professionals from Israel’s aerospace and defense industry. “We’re building a system that is looking at different sensors and the first system is GPS,” Zunger says. Using a proprietary array of off-the-shelf antennas and software developed internally, the system Regulus has designed can determine whether a GPS signal is legitimate or has been spoofed by a hacker (think of it as a way to defend against the kind of hack that the bad guys in “ Die Hard 2 “). Zunger first had the idea to launch the company three years ago while he was working with drones at the Israeli technology firm, Elbit. At the time, militaries were beginning to develop technologies to combat drone operations and Zunger figured it was only a matter of time before those technologies made their way into the commercial drone market as well. While the technology works for unmanned aerial vehicles, it also has applications for pretty much any type of autonomous transportation technology. Backing the company are a clutch of well-known Israeli and American investors including Sierra Ventures, Canaan Partners Israel, Technion, and F2 Capital. Regulus, which raised $6.3 million in financing before emerging from stealth, said that the money will be used to expand its sales and marketing efforts and to continue to develop its technology. The company’s first two products are a spoofing protection module that integrates with any autonomous vehicle; and a communication security manager that protects against hacking and misdirection. “We are very excited to lead this round of financing. Sensors security for autonomous machines will become as important as processors security. Regulus identified the key vulnerabilities and developed the best-in-class solutions,” said Ben Yu, a managing director of Sierra Ventures, in a statement. “Having been working with the company since seed funding, Sierra invested with strong confidence in the team to build Regulus into the category leader.”",Over the next twenty years the autonomous vehicle market is expected to grow into a $700 billion industry as robots take over nearly every aspect of mobility.

Jess Joho,"Season 1 of The Handmaid's Tale left viewers in total suspense, with a final shot of Offred gliding away from the camera and into the darkness of a van promising an unknown future. Season 2's April premiere is still far away, but new photos released by Hulu show off more of the show's gorgeous cinematography, finding vibrant beauty in the bleakest of worlds. SEE ALSO: 2017 was the year women took back their own narratives If anyone wondered why Handmaid's Tale has been sweeping at every awards show — taking home almost everything it was nominated for at the Emmys, Golden Globes, and Critics' Choice awards — then here's definitive proof that you need to pay attention to this show. Details on the plot for the upcoming season are hard to predict, since we're in largely uncharted territory when it comes to Margaret Atwood's original source material. But we can glean a few things, with the new photos depicting imagery that feels both new and hauntingly familiar. The illusions to religious imagery is only getting sharper Image: TAKE FIVE/Hulu One reveals what we can only assume are ""The Colonies"" often referenced to in Season 1, as the horrible place that troublemakers in Gilead's society get taken. What happens in ""The Colonies?"" Even the citizen's of Gilead only have rumors, so we'll have to wait and see. Elizabeth Moss' Offred (or June) — who ended the last season discovering she was pregnant — can be seen giving a steely look while covered in blood. Judging from all of last season's cutaways to sharp objects and Offred's growing need for violence, we imagine she'll only become more radicalized in Season 2. Offred is in red again, but not the kind we're used to seeing Image: Take Five/Hulu Another shot shows a line of women that appear much like the Handmaids, but dressed in black garb and red masks that cover their face — a stark contrast to the strict red and white dress code that previously signified their status in Gilead's society. Is this a new look for the handmaids — or a totally new, different class? Image: Take five/Hulu Well, leave it to Handmaid's Tale to speak volumes with only a few powerful, poignant images.

Adam Rosenberg,"Who cares if no one could read it ? A win is a win, right? A hastily sewn together Republican tax bill, dubbed by many on Twitter as the #GOPTaxScam, passed through the U.S. Senate after a critical vote at around 2 a.m. on Dec. 2. Now, as Americans wake up to the news on Saturday morning, social media is awash with responses. People are pissed. SEE ALSO: As a GOP congressman, I'm happy to answer questions about our tax plan. But wouldn't you rather hear about my new puppies!? The GOP bill amounts to a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code that also inserts ""bonus"" changes like a repeal of ObamaCare's individual mandate and approval to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In a broader sense, it essentially funds significant tax cuts for the country's wealthiest using everyone else's money. The bill, which already survived a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, now has one more legislative hurdle to clear — reconciliation talks to bring the House and Senate versions in line, followed by another vote — before it can be signed into law. Social media isn't taking the news quietly. Between the controversial bill itself, the numerous last-minute amendments added to appease different GOP interests, the hasty and one-sided process that brought it together, and the dead-of-night approval, it's clear that some not-small portion of the American public is feeling betrayed by their elected officials this morning. Shocker. Trickle-down doesn’t work. There is no evidence that it works.

Pete Pachal,"The future of the car is driverless. Everyone knows this, and it was on full display at CES 2018, with a host of companies showing off why their particular flavor of self-driving was better than the company just a few feet over on the Las Vegas Convention Center parking lot. The thing is, true self-driving cars — ones that can drive on any street and take you door to door — are likely still several years away. The not as revolutionary but more immediate trend in automotive technology that will change the way we drive in the next few years are connected cars. SEE ALSO: 3 security issues facing self-driving cars The next generation of cars will have always-on mobile connections and internal sensors, and that's leading automakers to re-imagine in-car experiences with touchscreens, voice interactions, and even gesture control. It sounds impressive and usually looks really sleek, but, based on what I tried out at CES, the dashboards of the future may not be what we want, or even be a very good experience overall. The upgrade car owners will feel the soonest is in tech that's already commonplace on dashboards: touch. However, the touchscreens of tomorrow will be a leap ahead of the lag-ridden resistive touchscreens that are the norm in cars today (touch-first UIs like Tesla's notwithstanding): They're going to be much more closer to the capacitive multitouch experiences that we're used to on iPhones and iPads. The dashboard as an iPad The poster child for these is the 2018 Mercedes A-Class. Shipping very soon, the new car features a 10-inch touchscreen that's big but not too big, and as responsive as a smartphone. The UI has large iconography that's designed not to distract, and it's very customizable: You can even set it to display virtually nothing while you drive (which would be my preference). The dashboard on the new Mercedes A-Class makes voice and touch the primary ways to interact. Image: Pete Pachal/Mashable Dashboards like the A-Class's make me uneasy, though, since they ditch most hard buttons altogether. This isn't a trend I'm a fan of, mostly because I find keeping your eyes on the road is easier if you can find your way around a dashboard with touch. Of course, that's why the A-Class also features conversational voice interactions, letting you just talk to your car to do things like play music or turn on the AC. More on that in a minute. As far as big-screen dashboards go, the most outlandish one I saw was on Byton's SUV concept. The 40-inch(!) display is recessed, and it stretches from one side of the windshield to the other. It's not a touchscreen; instead the driver controls everything with buttons and touchscreen on the steering wheel. While the car's stopped, though, the Byton activates a new kind of interaction: gestures. You can point and select things on the screen with your fingers, just like you'd do with Microsoft Kinect. That's a UI experience I've never found satisfying, and if it were used to control car functions it would be downright dangerous, but thankfully Byton was wise enough to deactivate gesture control while the car is in motion. Look whose car is talking Forget touching and pointing at screens, though; in the end, what we really want is to simply talk to our cars and have them do things for us. Basically, we want Alexa in the car. A number of automakers have already announced they're working on exactly that, but CES saw them grow in rank, including Toyota, the world's largest car manufacturer. Panasonic announced it would work to bring both Alexa and Google Assistant to the infotainment systems it provides to carmakers. At least a few auto manufacturers, however, think they can craft a better voice experience for their own cars, and one of their demos — the Mercedes A-Class I mentioned above — has me almost convinced. The in-car assistant was great at parsing natural language and inferring intent. Instead of saying clinical instructions like, ""Mercedes, lower the cabin temperature by 2 degrees,"" you can just say, ""Mercedes, it's hot,"" and it'll perform the same action. Cuing up specific songs, genres, and radio stations was just as easy and natural. I also got a chance to sample the voice experience in the latest Toyota Camry XLE, which uses voice-recognition tech from a company called Voicebox. Again, it could interpret natural commands like, ""I really need to call Sam."" The Toyota Camry XLE dashboard, with voice interactions powered by Voicebox. Image: Pete Pachal/Masahble The promise of all these systems is that, as cars get connected, the experience can be updated anytime. Tesla has been offering over-the-air software updates for a long time, and other automakers have been following suit. When 5G becomes a reality, the trend will only accelerate. Many of these interfaces are bumpy. When I was in the Mercedes it had a hard time understanding the word ""jazz."" The Byton's gesture control looks like a disaster. And there are still questions about security and privacy to be worked out. But the in-car experience is evolving, and riding a car in the 2020s will likely feel a bit empty without Alexa, Google, or one of their chatty cousins as a passenger. Hope you weren't too in love with those buttons.","The future of the car is driverless.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"It’s been about six years since Apple’s last education-focused event, but the company’s upcoming keynote on March 27th could mean more affordable devices and improved educational apps for classrooms and college campuses, a move designed to get more iOS devices in the hands of students. Apple says the event, to be held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, will center around “creative ideas for teachers and students.” While the invitation alludes to the Apple Pencil (currently supported only by the iPad Pro), we’ll most likely see some cheaper iPads, according to Bloomberg. Right now, the $329 9.7-inch iPad is the cheapest tablet Apple makes, but a cheaper 9.7-inch model, possibly costing $259, would make it easier for schools to buy them in bulk. It would also be the cheapest laptop-like product Apple makes. We’re also expecting to see a new version of Apple’s iBooks app (to be called “Books”) that may include a redesigned interface, audiobook support, and an improved shopping experience in the app. Apple’s already got a handful of education-focused apps in the form of the Classroom app, iTunes U, Swift Playgrounds, and iTunes U. Apple may also announce ClassKit, a new development framework targeting educational developers that showed up in the release of iOS 11.3 beta 2. And according to 9to5Mac, an app called Classwork, “designed to track student’s progress in class and share it with teachers,” may also make an appearance. It’s possible new MacBooks, priced below $1,000, will be announced next week, too. But according to Bloomberg’s unnamed sources, that’s unlikely. Though it looks like the event won’t be streamed live, the keynote is expected to start on Tuesday at 11AM Eastern (10AM in Chicago).

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,"And he has demonstrated a willingness to actively oppose Mr. Trump’s policies, as much of the Democratic Party’s liberal base is demanding. V ideo of a House speech in which Mr. Kennedy chastised Speaker Paul D. Ryan for calling repeal of the Affordable Care Act an act of mercy (“This is not an act of mercy, it’s an act of malice,” Mr. Kennedy said) was viewed more than 10 million times on Facebook. (“Wow,” Howard Dean, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on Twitter. “This is a Kennedy who could be president. A must-watch.”) Another in which Mr. Kennedy called for unity and compassion after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year drew 15 million views. Democrats expect that Mr. Kennedy’s passion on these issues — along with his age and his family legacy of public service — will present a sharp contrast with Mr. Trump. More broadly, the Democrats are showcasing Mr. Kennedy to the nation as a fresh face. “The Democrats are trying to show that they are moving forward,” said Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University. “They want to show they’re not just the party of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. They’re turning the page.” Mr. Kennedy has been steeped in politics since birth. In 1980, the year he and his twin brother, Matthew, were born, the family was focused on a presidential bid by his great-uncle, Senator Kennedy. His father, Joseph P. Kennedy II, was elected to Congress in 1986; his parents were divorced in 1991. He and Matthew attended Stanford University, where Joseph earned the nickname “Milkman” from his lacrosse teammates because he did not drink alcohol. After graduating in 2003, he joined the Peace Corps, working in the Dominican Republic (he speaks Spanish) and returning in 2006 to help with Uncle Ted’s re-election campaign to the Senate. Mr. Kennedy earned his law degree from Harvard in 2009 and joined the district attorney’s office on Cape Cod. He resigned in 2012 to run for the congressional seat being vacated by Barney Frank. He was re-elected to his third term in 2016 with 70 percent of the vote. He met his future wife, Lauren Anne Birchfield, the co-founder of a nonprofit organization, Neighborhood Villages, in Ms. Warren’s law school class. They are the parents of Eleanor, 2, and James Matthew, who was born Dec. 20. Mr. Kennedy is to deliver his speech Tuesday from Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School in Fall River, Mass., a former industrial center about 50 miles south of Boston. Fall River was built by immigrants and at one time was the leading textile center in America, nicknamed “Spindle City,” but its prosperity ebbed after World War I and never fully returned. Despite this being deep blue Massachusetts, Mr. Trump captured a third of the vote in Fall River in 2016 and won several neighboring towns. The region is home to the sort of working-class voters the Democrats need if they are to regain control of Congress, and the party hopes Mr. Kennedy can deliver an economic message that will serve as a template for Democrats across the country to bring them back in the midterm elections. The moment essentially marks Mr. Kennedy’s national debut. Mr. Berry, the political scientist, said that if all goes well, it could help him shift into a more prominent role. “It’s been a slow process because he hasn’t been highly visible,” Mr. Berry said. “In a state of passionate liberals, Warren is the leader of the party. Kennedy has been in the shadows.” Some of that may change on Tuesday night. Continue reading the main story","Representative Joseph P.

MARC TRACY,"Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.
College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.
The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyers seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (only) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.
But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyones league.
Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.
Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last years runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Hermans.","Alabama can, in fact, get pummeled, Urban Meyer is not beyond judgment, and other valuable nuggets that will make the game different in the fall.",2019-01-11T18:40:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On College Football: What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/sports/2018-college-football-season.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/sports/13oncollege1/merlin_148723005_9ea6bf1d-3d88-4c1b-9974-8eb6225b1b5f-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
Rhett Allain,"Occasionally there are physics lab demonstrations that I think are pretty awesome but that my students just think are ""meh."" This is one of those cases. The basic idea in this demo, which I used in my class at Southeastern Louisiana University, is to swing a mass around in a horizontal circle. But wait! There's a cooler part: By running the string through a vertical tube and attaching it to another mass, we can control the tension in the string. It's loads of fun. What am I talking about? Maybe this will help. Yes. That is me. I have a confused look on my face because I have to concentrate to keep the swinging length constant. Maybe this is why the students dislike this lab. Oh well. There are a few important features of this swinging mass. Let me draw a diagram. If you want to swing the mass around with a lower angular velocity, the string will need to be longer. If you want a shorter string, the mass will have to spin around faster. This is the only way to make it work since the tension in the string is constant. Why is the tension constant? Consider the mass hanging down at the bottom of the tube (I have labeled this M 2 ). Since this mass is just hanging there (and not spinning in a circle) then it is in equilibrium with an acceleration of zero meters per second squared. Since the acceleration (in the y-direction) is zero, then the net force must be zero Newtons. There are only two forces in the vertical direction, the downward gravitational force with a magnitude of M 2 g (where g = 9.8 N/kg) and the upward tension (T). That means the tension has to have a value of M 2 g—no matter how you are swinging the other mass. What about that angle that the string makes as the mass moves around in a circle (labeled as θ above)? How does this angle change as you swing at different speeds? Let me start with a force diagram for mass m 1. Although this mass is moving in a circle, it's just a horizontal circle. There is no motion and no acceleration in the vertical direction. This means the net force in the y-direction must be zero. Looking at the tension, the component of tension in the y-direction depends on the magnitude of the tension (which I already know) and the angle (which I don't). I can write this as the following equation. Using the value of the magnitude of the tension (from before), I get the following expression for θ. That's it—θ. It doesn't even depend on how fast you swing the mass or the string length. That sort of seems crazy, but it's true. Since the tension in the string is constant and the vertical component of the tension force must be constant, the angle must also be constant. Let me just check with a quick measurement. Here are two swings with the same masses, but different lengths. From this, it seems I get 30.4° and 22.8°. That's not exactly the same—not quite sure why there is such a difference. One problem might be that I am not exactly swinging it in a horizontal circle. Maybe I will have to do a bit more exploration here. OK, there is one more thing to look at. What about the relationship between the angular velocity and the length of the string? Looking at the force diagram above, there is only a component of the tension force acting in the horizontal direction. This means the net horizontal force can't be zero. In fact, it has to be equal to the mass (m 1 ) multiplied by the acceleration. In this case, the mass is accelerating to the right since it is moving in a circle. The circular acceleration would be the product of the angular velocity squared (we like to use the symbol ω for this) and the radius of the circle. Notice that the radius of the circle is not the length of the string—instead it is the length of the string multiplied by the cosine of θ (to get that adjacent side of the triangle). Putting this together, I get the following. This equation says that the square of the angular velocity should be proportional to one divided by the length of the string. That seems simple enough to test. All I need to do is to swing the mass around with different length strings (the length from the top of the tube to the mass). I can do this by watching a small piece of tape at the bottom of the tube to make sure the length is constant. Of course I need to also keep the masses constant. I can determine the angular velocity by measuring the time it takes the mass to make one rotation. The angular velocity will then bey 2π divided by this time. I did this for five different lengths using a hanging mass of 50 grams and a swinging mass of 15.8 grams. Here is a plot of ω squared vs. 1/L: That looks fairly linear. But the important part is the slope. Looking back at the relationship between ω 2 and 1/L, the proportionality constant should be M 2 g/m 1. I know the masses and I know g, so this constant should be 31 m/s 2. The linear fit has a slope of 43 m/s 2 —so not quite the same, but still close. Still, if this was a student lab report, I think that data would be acceptable. I'm still slightly concerned that the swinging angle isn't constant and this slope isn't closer to the expected value. I have a feeling that there might be some friction between the string and the rotating glass rod. Friction at the contact point would mean that the tension in the string at the swinging mass is not M 2 g, but something else. Maybe I need to come up with a different method to measure the tension. Honestly, this is a great reason why you should always work through the lab experiments—even if you are pretty sure you know how stuff works. You just never know how things will turn out.","With a specific setup, you can control the tension in the string.",2018-05-09T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Physics of Swinging a Mass on a String for Fun,https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-of-swinging-a-mass-on-a-string-for-fun/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5af238d714823b60460cfe32/191:100/pass/MassOnString-149868420.jpg,wired,Wired,class-2,1
Melissa Jeltsen,"Mary Primis, 35, was getting ready for a bodybuilding competition on Saturday morning when she glanced over at the television and caught the news. The night before, a gunman opened fire inside a hot yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, killing two women and injuring five others. According to reports, the man began shooting as people were settling into child’s pose, a calming, grounding stretch often used to begin class. Of the seven people shot, six were women. The scene was all too familiar to Primis. Nine years earlier, she was instructing an aerobics class in Pennsylvania when a man entered the room and began shooting the women inside. Twelve women were struck by bullets, including her, and three of them died. The perpetrator, George Sodini, shot himself. So did Scott Beierle, the man police say attacked the Tallahassee yoga studio on Friday. But the similarities between the two men run far deeper. Both were white men in their 40s. Both targeted exercise classes traditionally favored by female clients. Both felt rejected by women and blamed them for their failures in life. Both posted their distorted, misogynistic ramblings online. And both left behind a group of survivors forced to live with those depraved actions. “I know what I saw. I know how I felt,” Primis told HuffPost on Monday. “I know what they must be going through now, and I share in their grief.” An Upbeat Aerobics Class, Then Lights Out In 2009, Primis was 26 and teaching exercise classes at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh. She was newly pregnant. On a late summer evening, she was leading a Latin cardio dance class. The room was full, she recalled, and all the participants were women. About 15 minutes into the class, she saw a man enter the studio. It was 48-year-old George Sodini. Primis was not initially alarmed, she said, because it was a busy club and people came and went. Then Sodini turned out the lights. In the dark, she was startled by loud pops. Unfamiliar with the sound of gunshots, she thought the lights were exploding. All around her, women were dropping to the floor, so she dropped too. “It wasn’t until I felt the first bullet that I realized what was happening,” she said. “Then I felt the second one.” Primis was shot in an arm and in her back, with a bullet breaking her ribs, shattering a shoulder blade and popping a lung. She lay on the floor and played dead, holding her breath and staying as still as possible. She couldn’t see Sodini and had no idea where he was in the room. Finally, the gunshots and screaming stopped, and the darkened studio was silent, save the thumping of dance music, which reverberated off the mirrored walls. “I remember thinking, ‘Please, someone turn that off,’” she said. Primis was transported to a hospital, where she remained for a week. In the meantime, the magnitude of the attack became clear. Three women were dead, including two of Primis’ regular clients. And Sodini’s motive began to emerge. He left behind a blog. Sodini’s Incel Legacy For nine months leading up to the shooting, Sodini, 48, wrote about his “exit plan” in an online journal and described his troubles with women. He bemoaned his inability to attract a partner and wrote that he had not had sex since he was 29. “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne - yet 30 million women rejected me - over an 18 or 25-year period,” he wrote. “Thirty million is my rough guesstimate of how many desirable single women there are. A man needs a woman for confidence... This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He complained that women treated him brutally in his youth and then ignored him in middle age. “The future holds nothing for me. Twenty five years of nothing fun,” he said. “I never even spent one weekend with a girl in my life, even at my own place.” He also posted odd YouTube videos in which he referred to his desire for a girlfriend. Since his death, Sodini has taken on semi-famous status among the involuntary celibate, or incel, community — men who believe they can’t attract a partner and who blame women for their romantic and sexual failures. On incel sites, posters sometimes use “going Sodini” as shorthand for committing a violent attack on women. Others use the term “going ER,” which refers to the much better-known attack by Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in a stabbing and shooting spree in Isla Vista, California, in 2014. Before going on his rampage, Rodger posted a manifesto in which he explained that he had “no choice but to exact revenge on the society” that denied him sex and love. The shooting in Tallahassee is the second deadly attack this year with ties to the incel community. In April, Alek Minassian drove a van into pedestrians in Toronto, killing 10 eight of whom were women. Before his attack, he posted a message on Facebook celebrating the “Incel Rebellion” and Rodger. Beierle’s Yoga Studio Attack Like Sodini, Beierle, 40, left a trail of online musings about women. In YouTube videos believed to be posted by Beierle in 2014, which have now been removed, he railed against the “treachery” of women — calling them “cunts,” “bitches“ and “vipers” — and expressed a desire to get even with those who wronged him. He claimed girls treated him harshly when he was young. Later in life, he said, they disrespected him, giving him their phone numbers when they had boyfriends or calling the police on him for no reason. “Made one date, [she] didn’t show up. Made another date, [she] didn’t show up. Kept making excuses,” he said of one woman. “Ah, I could have ripped her head off.” In one video, titled “The Plight of the Adolescent Male,” Beierle said he related to Rodger. “I don’t think a female can ever understand a societal pressure that is put on an adolescent male to unburden himself of this stigma,” he said, referring to virginity. His hatred toward women was not limited to online videos. In 2012, Beierle was arrested on two counts of simple battery after two young women told police that he grabbed their buttocks at a dining hall at Florida State University. In 2016 he was arrested again after being accused of grabbing another woman’s buttocks at a pool at his apartment complex. The charges in both cases were dismissed. It remains unclear why Beierle targeted Hot Yoga Tallahassee and whether he had a connection to the studio or any of the victims. To this day, Primis doesn’t know why Sodini picked her aerobics class that night, though it appears to have been premeditated. He had a copy of the class schedule, investigators said, and her class was circled. She said he probably he picked it because it was one of the largest classes the studio offered. And because “every week, it was all women,” she added. 9 Years Later, Stronger But Changed After she was shot, Primis, who was 10 weeks pregnant at the time, put all her energy into getting better for her baby. “I never really gave [Sodini] much thought. Or read much about him. All I knew is that he had killed himself and he just wanted revenge against women,” she said. Primis went on to have a healthy birth. Her son — her first — is now 8. A few years later, she had twins, now 6. Nine years after the attack, she still has pain from the shrapnel lodged in her body. But she’s physically stronger than ever, running marathons and entering in bodybuilding competitions. She lives in the same community in Pennsylvania and teaches exercise classes, though she never returned to LA Fitness. Emotionally, she said, she has been forever altered by Sodini’s rampage. “I still, to this day, don’t trust people I don’t know,” she said. “I watch everybody closely. When I am out in public, I always, in the back of my mind, have an escape plan and tend to plan for the worst, which is not the way I used to be.” Over time, she has learned to forgive Sodini, she said, calling him a very sick person. While she wouldn’t wish her experience on anybody, she said she isn’t sorry it happened to her. “I learned invaluable lessons,” she said. “Life is precious. I try to make the most of it now.” For the survivors of the yoga studio shooting, she had one message: “It does get better. It just takes time.”","HuffPost 2 Exercise Classes. 2 Deadly Shootings. 1 Sinister Motive.

Two Stanford University students are suing the University of Southern California, Yale, the University of California Los Angeles and other institutions involved in the largest-ever admissions bribery case that broke Tuesday involving affluent parents paying coaches to get their kids into top universities. 
Erica Olsen and Kalea Woods say they were denied a fair opportunity to gain admission to top colleges, and that their Stanford degrees were devalued, by criminal racketeering charges leveled by federal prosecutors.
In the complaint, Olsen said she had stellar standardized test scores and athletic talent, but was nonetheless rejected by Yale after paying her application fee.
""Had she known that the system at Yale University was warped and rigged by fraud, she would not have spent the money to apply to the school,"" the lawsuit states.""She also did not receive what she paid fora fair admissions consideration process.""
The alleged scandal, as laid out in court Tuesday in a federal indictment and a guilty plea by a rogue college consultant involved bribing coaches, falsifying athletic records and substituting exam takers. 
The consultant, William ""Rick"" Singer, 58, of Newport Beach, California, pleaded guilty to racketeering, money laundering, tax evasion and obstruction of justice in a federal courtroom in Boston.

Noel Murray,"There are so many streaming options available these days, and so many conflicting recommendations, that it’s hard to see through all the crap you could be watching. Each Friday, The Verge’s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services, and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend. What to watch The blood-soaked 2000 Japanese thriller Battle Royale. The film follows a group of teenage classmates who are deposited on a small deserted island and compelled to murder each other to survive. Director Kinji Fukasaku and his son, screenwriter Kenta Fukasaku (adapting a Koushun Takami novel) don’t waste much time on setup. Instead, they briefly introduce a few of the kids — in particular, moody orphan Shuya (played by Tatsuya Fujiwara) and diligent student Noriko (Aki Maeda) — and their former teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), who’s collaborating with this government-approved extermination program as part of an earnest effort to counteract juvenile delinquency. Once the major players are on the field, mayhem ensues, as some youngsters form tenuous alliances, while others try to figure out if there’s a way to subvert the system before their former friends stab, shoot, or poison them. Why watch now? Because The First Purge is playing in theaters this weekend. The fourth film in the popular action-horror franchise is a prequel, set as the New Founding Fathers of America experiment with letting the country’s underclass freely commit crimes — preferably against each other — on one night each year. More uncomfortably close to reality than ever, The First Purge suggests that even seemingly upstanding citizens are all too willing to cede power to cruel authoritarians, so long as the people in charge promise to target ethnic minorities and the poor, for the overall benefit of the middle-class majority. Increasingly, this series has become one long case study in how governing based on fear, discrimination, and violence has unpredictable and often catastrophic results. These have been common themes in science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction over the decades, for about as long as those genres have existed. Logan’s Run, 1984, Escape from New York, George Romero’s zombie movies, and countless other books and films have depicted a terrified, paranoid humanity, struggling to manage real and perceived threats to their survival by imposing a rigid social order that ultimately makes everything worse. In the wake of the international success of Battle Royale, the young-adult literature market exploded with similar sagas about teens fighting each other to the death, by dictatorial edict. The most popular was The Hunger Games — which was criticized at times for being a sanitized version of Battle Royale. In the Fukasaku film, a cash-strapped Japan has passed the “Millennium Educational Reform Act,” the purpose of which seems to be twofold: to reduce the population of teens about to enter a thin employment market, and to punish those kids for the bad attitudes they’ve developed during a time of national crisis. Battle Royale isn’t as pointed in its social critique as some of the movies, novels, TV series, and comics that have come before or since. But it’s fairly resolute in its opinion that even the most obnoxious of this game’s contestants are being unfairly targeted by insensitive, short-sighted adults. Photo: Toei Company Who it’s for People who enjoy debating situational ethics — and who don’t mind watching a slew of fictional folks get slaughtered in entertaining ways. Battle Royale was controversial when it was originally released, in part because the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School was still fresh in the public memory, and some critics found the idea of turning “kids killing kids” into an over-the-top action-adventure picture appalling, or even dangerous. Unlike later iterations of this premise ( The Hunger Games, for example), Battle Royale isn’t especially somber. Fukasaku employs an almost comically melodramatic Masamichi Amano score, and he and his son have fun with the way teen vanity and social hierarchies persist even after all the students are armed. Perversely, Battle Royale ’s lack of concern with socially responsibility or political cogency is what makes it so effective. Because the Fukasakus don’t seem to care overmuch about making any particular point, they’re freed to tell Takami’s story in a way that’s gripping first and foremost, with twists and surprises that at times have viewers actively rooting for something awful to happen. The film has the power to expose its audience’s own tenuous morality. Where to see it Netflix. For more dystopian mayhem and deadly teens, the service also offers Battle Royale 2 (directed by Kenta Fukasaku, who took over the production after his father died in 2003), Tag (Sion Sono’s 2015 art-horror film about a Japanese high-school girl stumbling through a surreal landscape where her peers keep dying in spectacularly disgusting ways) and 3% (a Brazilian TV series set in a bleak future Earth where impoverished young people are given a yearly opportunity to compete to join the upper class).","In the genre of “exploitation films about the government forcing people to kill each other,” this one’s a classic",2018-07-06T15:45:49Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","With The First Purge in theaters, it’s a good weekend to watch Battle Royale on Netflix",https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540508/the-first-purge-streaming-recommendation-battle-royale-netflix,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cz6sjBMQZabdFTwu_Q2AGSK1JM=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11652013/11096455_679019408909922_8129622812917519401_o.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-2,1
Tom McKay,"Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who either denies climate change or thinks it might be goood, actually depending on how he feels that day, has done his very best to decimate the agency’s ranks at the same time he’s spent hundreds of thousands in taxpayer money on elaborate security measures like 24-hour guards and biometric office locks. Now, per the New Hampshire Union Leader, Pruitt has an explanation for the $90,000-plus he spent flying on largely-first class seats in June 2017. It’s that people hate him so much he requires extra security, lest randos jump him in coach or whatever. “Unfortunately... we’ve had some incidents on travel dating back to when I first started serving in the March-April timeframe,” Pruitt told the Union Leader on Tuesday. “We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment.” “We’ve reached the point where there’s not much civility in the marketplace and it’s created, you know, it’s created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat,” Pruitt continued. “I’m not involved in any of those decisions... Those are all made by the (security) detail, the security assessment in addition to the chief of staff.” As the Huffington Post noted, the EPA has defended Pruitt’s lavish flight expenditures aslegitimate government spending, and CNN reported he’s received numerous death threats: The EPA defended Pruitt’s travel in an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, saying ethics officials had approved the expenses. Federal regulations state that government employees must “consider the least expensive class of travel” for their needs, but security concerns do allow for more expensive bookings. CNN reported in October that Pruitt gets at least “ four to five times the number of threats ” as his predecessor. He’s also the first person in the role to have a full-time security detail at a cost of about $2 million a year. More threats than his predecessors may not exactly be a Code Red situation, though, as prior agency chiefs did not request anywhere near the same level of security as Pruitt. Former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman, a vocal Pruitt critic herself controversial from her tenure under President George W. Bush, told CNN that she felt no need to install elaborate security systems in her office and that cleaning staff could enter and exit with no restrictions. It’s pretty obvious that sending Pruitt death threats is bad, extremely dumb, and absolutely will not do anything to make him think twice about his relentless crusade against the environmental mission of his own agency. But at the same time, something tells me he’s been reading a little too much about “antifa supersoldiers.” In any case, perhaps the reason the EPA is suddenly attracting so much negative publicity over the course of the past year is things like Pruitt suggesting that it would be “arrogant” for humans to predict what temperatures are ideal for the continued survival of the species at the turn of the century, or his efforts to deregulate major polluters, or raise radiation safety limits, and various stuff of that nature. Not sure it says that in How to Make Friends and Influence People, though hey, there’s a lot of reading Pruitt should probably catch up on.

JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,"With victory on your side, it always helps a lot, said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, who said he would back Ms. Pelosi for speaker. But he and other more centrist members of the party in the House will insist on changes to ensure they have a voice in legislating and policymaking. Some of the Democratic candidates most outspoken about opposing her speakership lost on Tuesday, such as Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and Dan McCready in North Carolina. But others won, including Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. Mr. Trumps endorsement comes with an edge. Republicans have long cheered Ms. Pelosis continued reign over House Democrats, seeing in her the perfect foil for negative campaign ads to rile conservative voters. Ms. Pelosi again was the star of hundreds of Republican ads that blanketed the country. In recent months, the president, who phoned Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday night to congratulate her on the Democrats victory, singled her out by name and savaged her during his raucous rallies. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday night that he planned to run for majority leader, the No. 2 position in the House, while Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina plans to run for whip, the No. 3 post. That lineup, if endorsed by Democrats, would preserve the top three positions in the partys House caucus as they currently are with none of the youthful sheen of the incoming class.","As Ms. Pelosi moves to line up the votes to resume her speakership of the House, she secured an endorsement from President Trump, who may relish the chance to spar with her over the next two years.",2018-11-07T17:12:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Nancy Pelosi for Speaker?

George Dvorsky,"Using a computer powered by an off-the-shelf Intel Core i5-6600 processor, a FedEx employee from Tennessee has discovered the largest prime number known to humanity. At 23,249,425 digits long, it’s nearly a million digits longer than the previous record holder. For those of you who failed or have long forgotten grade 3 math class, a prime number is any number that can only be divided by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.). It’s a freaky quirk of the Universe that has captivated mathematicians for centuries, as their appearance in the roll call of all integers defies prediction ( though biases have been detected in the distribution of consecutive primes ). Finding prime numbers thus requires a bit of trial-and-error, patience, and a lot of computing power. The new record-holding prime number, dubbed “M77232917,” was discovered by Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, on December 26, 2017. It was discovered as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a group that does exactly what its name implies. Mersenne primes—named after the 17th century French monk Marin Mersenne—are a rare class of primes that are one integer less than a number that’s been multiplied by itself, expressed as M n =2 n -1. In this case, the new prime was calculated by multiplying 77,232,917 by 77,232,917 and then subtracting one (2 77,232,917 -1). The new prime is the 50th known Mersenne prime. M77232917 contains 23,249,425 digits, which is practically impossible for the human brain to comprehend.

You get the point. According to GIMP, that’s big enough to fill an entire shelf of books totalling 9,000 pages. Or put another way, “If every second you were to write five digits to an inch then 54 days later you’d have a number stretching over 73 miles (118 km)—almost 3 miles (5 km) longer than the previous record prime,” writes GIMP. Pace, a long-time math enthusiast and a current employee at FedEx, does charity work as a SysAdmin, running Prime95 on all his PCs and servers; Pace is one of thousands of volunteers who are using free GIMPS software in the effort to continually find larger and larger prime numbers. The PC that Pace used to find the prime number required six straight days of computation on a quad-core Intel i5-6600 CPU to verify it. Indeed, the discovery of new primes is no small task; every candidate prime must go through the time-consuming and rigorous process of being cut-up by any potential divisors. Once a candidate prime is discovered, it has to be verified by outside sources. In this case, the prime was independently verified by four different programs running on different hardware configurations: Aaron Blosser verified it using Prime95 on an Intel Xeon server in 37 hours. David Stanfill verified it using gpuOwL on an AMD RX Vega 64 GPU in 34 hours Andreas Höglund verified the prime using CUDALucas running on NVidia Titan Black GPU in 73 hours Ernst Mayer also verified it using his own program Mlucas on 32-core Xeon server in 82 hours. Andreas Höglund also confirmed using Mlucas running on an Amazon AWS instance in 65 hours. The quest to find more prime numbers may seem frivolous, but they hold practical applications as well, such as the generation of public key cryptography algorithms, hash tables, and as random number generators. Further work into primes could also tell us a bit more about mathematics and why it’s so damned good at describing the universe. And as Carl Sagan speculated in Cosmos, transmitting streams of consecutive primes could also be used as a way of saying “hello” to an alien civilization. As exciting as this discovery is, the Holy Grail of primes is yet to be found: a prime number containing 100 million digits. The first person to find this elusive number will be awarded $150,000 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Good luck!

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Google’s claim that it doesn’t have a pay gap problem has once again been disputed, this time by a former preschool teacher who worked at the company’s childcare center. Former employee Heidi Lamar filed a complaint on Wednesday with the San Francisco Superior Court alleging that Google paid women in preschool and infant/toddler teaching positions less than men for similar jobs. The complaint was filed as an amendment to an existing class action lawsuit filed in September by former Google employees Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease, and Kelli Wisuri. Lamar is now included as a plaintiff on the lawsuit, which includes 30 different positions across six different categories, including product management, software engineering and sales. The lawsuit alleges that Google puts women in lower salary bands than men, places them in jobs that don’t pay as much as ones dominated by men, and promotes women “slowly and at lower rates than it promotes men.” It also alleges that female Google employees are paid less than men “performing similar work.” Additionally, the complaint claims that Google is or should have been aware of these violations. “Google’s failure to pay female employees the same compensation paid to male employees for substantially equal or substantially similar work has been and is willful,” the lawsuit states. According to the lawsuit, Lamar had a master’s degree in teaching, but was placed in a lower salary level than a male hired at the time who did not have a master’s degree in teaching or as much relevant job experience. Lamar was placed at salary Level 1, which paid $18.51 an hour, compared to the male who was hired for the same position and duties at salary Level 2, with an hourly rate of $21 an hour. Lamar was allegedly paid less than her male coworkers who performed similar positions as her from July 2013 until she was promoted at the end of 2016. Google employed about 150 preschool teachers at the time of Lamar’s employment, and about 147 were women. Of the three male teachers, two were hired into salary Level 2. “Ms. Lamar is only aware of one woman whom Google hired into salary Level 2 around or after Ms. Lamar’s start date, and that woman had over ten years of job experience,” the complaint states. “All the other women were hired into salary Level 1.” When Lamar discovered that she was underpaid compared to her male colleague in a similar position, she asked Google to compensate her for the wage gap from when she started through when she was promoted. Google declined to pay her for the discrepancy, and Lamar resigned in August of last year. Lamar’s claims follow a number of other pay gap allegations filed against Google over the past year. In April, the US Department of Labor accused the company of gender pay discrimination, which Google denied. The company also declined to provide the agency with requested historical salary records, claiming that the efforts were too costly. In September of last year, however, employees at Google took it upon themselves to compile their own wage data in a spreadsheet acquired by The New York Times, which revealed that men were on average paid more than women. Google spokesperson Gina Scigliano told Gizmodo at the time that its own data shows, when you take “location, tenure, job role, level and performance” into account, that “women are paid 99.7% of what men are paid at Google,” and characterized the Times story as “extremely flawed.” Shortly after the spreadsheet was publicized, Ellis, Pease, and Wisuri filed the class-action lawsuit that Lamar has since been added to as a plaintiff. Scigliano once again told Gizmodo that Google disagreed with the wage gap allegations. “We work really hard to create a great workplace for everyone, and to give everyone the chance to thrive here,” Scigliano said in September. “In relation to this particular lawsuit, we’ll review it in detail, but we disagree with the central allegations. Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions,” he continued. “And we have extensive systems in place to ensure that we pay fairly.” When Gizmodo reached out to Google to comment on the latest wave of allegations made by Lamar, Scigliano said that the company disagrees “with the central allegations of this amended lawsuit,” attaching her earlier statement from September.

LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ,"Any judicial decree entered in this action will have a direct, tangible, and long-lasting impact not only on the parties, but most importantly on Nychas tenants, wrote the judge, who was appointed in 1998 by President Bill Clinton. Because the Proposed Consent Decree is not fair and reasonable, and because its entry would disserve the public interest, the governments motion for approval is denied. Rather than fight the suit initiated by the United States attorneys office, the housing authority entered a settlement that would have imposed a federal monitor to oversee the Housing Authority, and the city also agreed to invest almost $2 billion to fix up the authoritys deteriorating buildings, where more than 400,000 poor and working-class New Yorkers live. But Judge Pauleys surprise ruling threw the future of the beleaguered housing authority into question. The ruling came after a remarkable hearing in September where dozens of tenants shared with the judge their accounts of the living conditions at Nycha, as the housing authority is known. The judge wrote that he could not ignore the residents harrowing accounts of the squalid conditions in their apartments and the indifference of Nycha management. He said the agreement is not fair, reasonable or consistent with the public interest. Judge Pauley cited what he depicted as vague enforcement provisions in the agreement, pointing out they would be developed by the monitor and are not subject to the courts approval.",The federal judge’s surprise ruling concluded that the agreement designed to fix Nycha’s systemic flaws is not “consistent with the public interest.”,2018-11-14T19:21:47Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Judge Rejects $2 Billion Deal to Overhaul City’s Public Housing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/nyregion/nycha-settlement-court-ruling.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/nyregion/00nychamonitor/00nychamonitor-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
Erica Klarreich,"""Nadie te quita lo bailado.” (No one can take from you what you’ve danced.) For Federico Ardila, this Latin American expression epitomizes his approach to life and mathematics. It’s the driving force behind the parties he DJs in venues across the San Francisco Bay Area, where people dance till morning to the beats of his native Colombia. The dance floor is a place “where you have your freedom and you have your power, and nobody can take that away from you,” Ardila said. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. He taught the expression to his students at San Francisco State University, where he is a math professor, after giving them a punishingly hard exam. San Francisco State has a highly diverse student body, and Ardila, who just turned 40, is a prominent voice in the mathematics community about how to make students from underrepresented groups— such as women and people of color—feel that they belong. But on this occasion, as he looked around at his students’ demoralized faces, he knew he had missed the mark. “Nadie te quita lo bailado,” Ardila told his students. “I think that’s a very powerful message—that nobody can take away from you the joy that you’ve had doing mathematics,” he told Quanta Magazine in an interview last month. “And people can give you grades, but that’s not going to take away the freedom that you felt and the fulfillment that you felt.” The expression also applies to Ardila’s research, though not always in ways he would have chosen. Four years ago in Portland, Oregon, a thief smashed his car window and made off with a backpack containing, as luck would have it, five years’ worth of work—all of Ardila’s notes from a sweeping new paper he was developing. Proofs, examples, counterexamples and conjectures were all gone. But the thief couldn’t steal the mathematics Ardila had “danced” in his mind. Over the past few years, Ardila and his coauthor, Marcelo Aguiar of Cornell University, have painstakingly reconstructed their work unifying the geometric and algebraic sides of combinatorics—the study of discrete structures like a social network, a sudoku puzzle, or a phylogenetic tree. They finally posted their 113-page paper online in September, and in January Ardila will be presenting their work in an invited address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the biggest annual math conference in the United States. Quanta spoke with Ardila at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, where he is visiting for the fall semester, about the mathematics he has danced and taught. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Your mathematical talent was identified quite early—in fourth grade, you got the highest score in your age group in a national math competition in Colombia. It was actually my sister, Natalia, who first showed great promise in mathematics. I was just the little brother. She and my cousin Ana María, they both performed really, really well in this national math competition. And I think the organizers probably said, “OK, these two women are very good, and then here’s the little brother who’s coming along to the awards ceremony. Maybe he’s OK also.” I feel like from a young age, they were paying attention to me. I never enjoyed mathematics in school very much, but my experience through the Math Olympics was much more creative and much more playful. Federico Ardila as a child in Colombia with his mother, Amparo, and his sister, Natalia. And it turned out that it was, as many of these spaces are, a very male-dominated space, and eventually both my sister and my cousin felt uncomfortable with this space. I mean, they’re doing amazing things now; my cousin is an engineer and my sister is a music pedagogy professor. But I do think it’s kind of interesting—that was a space where I felt very comfortable and that felt very nurturing to me, and it didn’t feel so to other people. It was a space that was very “othering” for them. I think that’s always served to remind me of the role of a mathematician, of an educator, in curating the culture of a place. That’s why that’s been such a theme in my work. You’ve said that you were surprised to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where you did your undergraduate and doctoral studies. What’s the story there? I had never heard of MIT. And it hadn’t crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and apply. At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not like being told, “Read this” or “Think this way.” I just kind of wanted to do things on my own terms. I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have applied with that kind of transcript. I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that we’re not eligible or that we’re not good enough. And especially if you’re somebody who feels “othered” in your discipline or who feels like you’re lacking confidence, it’s easy to close doors on yourself. There’s a lot of people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you can’t do it for yourself. When you came to the United States, as an undergraduate at MIT, it was your turn to feel like the “other.” It’s not that anybody did anything to mistreat me or to doubt me or to explicitly make me feel unwelcome, but I definitely felt very different. I mean, my mathematical education was outstanding and I had fantastic access to professors and really interesting material, but I only realized in retrospect that I was extremely isolated. There’s a system in place that makes certain people comfortable and others uncomfortable, I think just by the nature of who’s in the space. And I say that without wanting to point fingers, because I think you can be critical about the spaces that “other” you, but you also have to be critical about the ways in which you “other” other people. I think because mathematics sees itself as very objective, we think we can just say, “Well, logically, this seems to make sense that we’re doing everything correctly.” I think sometimes we’re a little bit oblivious as to what is the culture of a place, or who feels welcome, or what are we doing to make them feel welcome? So when I try to create mathematical spaces, I try to be very mindful of letting people be their full human selves. And I hope that will give people more access to tools and opportunities. What are some of the ways you do that in your teaching? In a classroom I’m the professor, and so in some sense I’m the culture keeper. And one thing that I try to do—and it’s a little bit scary and it’s not easy—is to really try to shift the power dynamic and make sure that students feel like equally powerful contributors to the place. I try to create spaces where we’re kind of together constructing a mathematical reality. So, for example, I taught a combinatorics class, and in every single class every single student did something active and communicated their mathematical ideas to somebody else. The structure of the class was such that they couldn’t just sit there and be passive. I believe in the power of music, and so I got each one of them to play a song for the rest for us at the beginning of each class. At the beginning it felt like this wild experiment where I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I was really moved by their responses. Some of them would dedicate the song to their mom and talk about how whenever they’re studying math, they’re very aware that their mom worked incredibly hard to give them the opportunity to be the first ones in their family to go to college. Another student played this song in Arabic called “Freedom.” And she was talking about how in this day and age it’s very difficult for her to feel at home and welcome and free in this country, and how mathematics for her is a place where nobody can take her freedom away. That classroom felt like no other classroom that I’ve ever taught in. It was a very human experience, and it was one of the richest math classrooms that I’ve had. I think one worries when you do that, “Are you covering enough mathematics?” But when students are engaged so actively and when you really listen to their ideas, then magic happens that you couldn’t have done by preparing a class and just delivering it. Mathematics has this stereotype of being an emotionless subject, but you describe it in very emotional terms—for instance, in course curricula you promise your students a “joyful” experience. I think doing mathematics is tremendously emotional, and I think that anybody who does mathematics knows this. I just don’t think that we have the emotional awareness or vocabulary to talk about this as a community. But you walk around this building and people are making these discoveries, and there are so many emotions going on—a lot of frustration and a lot of joy. I think one thing that happens is we don’t acknowledge this as a culture—because mathematics is emotional in sometimes very difficult ways. It can really make you feel very bad about yourself sometimes. You can be pushing on something for six months and then have it collapse, and that hurts. I don’t think we talk about that hurt enough. And the joy of discovering something after six months of working on it is really deep. Your own research is in combinatorics. And the paper you’ll be presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings connects two different ways of understanding combinatorial structures, through the lenses of geometry and algebra. How do those two approaches work? When you look at the geometric side of things, suppose, for example, you want to study the permutations (the ways of rearranging a collection of objects). It’s pretty well known that if you have n objects, the number of ways of putting them in a row is n factorial (the product n ( n -1)( n -2)…1). So it’s not a very interesting problem to count how many ways there are. But what is their inherent structure? The three-dimensional permutahedron, a geometric depiction of the ways to rearrange the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Two permutations are connected by an edge if one can be transformed into the other by swapping two consecutive numbers. If you look at when two permutations are related to each other by just swapping two elements, then you start understanding not only how many there are but how are they related to each other. And then, when you say, “OK, let’s take all the permutations, and put an edge between two of them if they’re a swap away,” then you find that you get this beautiful shape that’s a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides). I think it’s completely surprising initially that the inherent relations between permutations are captured in this beautiful polytope called a permutahedron. So all of a sudden you have this geometric model, and you can use tools from polytope theory to try to say new things about permutations. And that polytope has existed for a long time and is very well understood. And then you can also think of permutations algebraically—there’s a natural sort of “multiplication” on permutations, in which the product of two permutations is the permutation you get by doing one permutation after the other. This is one of the most important objects in algebra, this group of permutations. There are these two traditions, to take combinatorial objects and either make them geometric or make them algebraic. This project with Marcelo Aguiar was about trying to bring together these two points of view, and in fact we discovered that polytopes like the permutahedra have an additional related algebraic structure. I think we found a really beautiful connection between the geometric and the algebraic structure of combinatorial objects. We got a dozen results just from building this architecture and then reaping the benefits. For many, though by no means all, mathematicians, teaching takes a back seat to research. But for you, it seems that teaching and research are very much intertwined. You often give your students open-ended problems, and you’ve co-authored many papers with students. I love working with students. And I love sharing the joy of discovery with them. Most of my students are master’s and undergrad students, because San Francisco State doesn’t have a PhD program. I think that has steered my research to things that are more immediately accessible. But still, I need the questions to be very deep. I’m very excited about my research. I think I’m doing the most interesting research of my life right now. People tell you at 40 you start declining, and I feel like I’m getting good now. Federico Ardila DJing at the 2017 Life Is Living Festival in Oakland. Almost a decade ago you founded a DJ collective based in Oakland. How does that tie into your work as a mathematician and teacher? When I DJ I’m really looking for joy, and I’m looking to create an atmosphere where people can build bridges and connect. My professor side comes out a little bit, because I play a lot of stuff that people don’t know, and I try to play music from many places that they haven’t thought about. I also see music as a tool for social change. Some of the events I do are social benefits—it’s about music, but it’s also about feeding the soul and getting ready for the change that you want to make in the world. It feels very similar to the kind of atmosphere that I try to create in a classroom. I see all of these things as being connected.

The company used LG-made screens in previous Pixels, and while both companies produce fine OLED screens, Samsung screens do tend to be a little better. Note that it's quite possible that Google is sourcing OLED screens from both companies.

Virginia K. Smith,"For those of us who remember the early-ish days of the internet, today marks the official end of an era, that if we’re honest with ourselves, ended long ago: the heyday of AOL Instant Messenger. The chat service is shutting down for good today, though most of its enthusiastic early users had long since abandoned it for Gchat, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and the myriad other chat options now available to us. The citizens of the internet woke up to some shocking news this morning: AIM, a pioneer in the… Read more Read But for many of us, AIM helped us cut our teeth and feel out the still-developing etiquette of online chat; how to wield away messages for good and for evil; maintaining Snapchat-like “streaks of hours logged on; navigating group chats; sliding into the DMs of crushes (or strangers); and expressing ourselves with ever more elaborate emojis. In the name of a digital Irish Wake (BYOB, sorry), we asked you for your most potent AIM memories, and boy, did you deliver. Below, one last tribute to the chat client that started it all: You trolled your fellow students: Whenever I was in the college computer lab, I always made it a point to uninstall AIM from the station I was at. Drove the other students that used the lab to goof off insane. ﻿ You made serious missteps with screen names : I had several embarrassing stories. 2 in particular.1. I had moved to California from Texas when I was 14. All of my friends at my small private school decided to call me Tex, which I owned, despite being a short pudgy Jewish kid from the suburbs without any athletic prowess. I had created the screen name “TtoThaX.” It made much sense to me with the caps lock choices, but to everyone else, ttothax just sounded like Roger Daughtry’s “My Generation” stuttering with a lisp.2. I had gotten sick of that particular reaction so much that I was in desperate need of change. For some strange reason, my small private school wrote a school song, where one of the lines read, “More precious than a sparkling jewel.” Due to my extreme lack of self-confidence, and the unanimous “panning” of the song from the students at my school, I thought I’d be funny, creative, and gain some high school popularity points by changing my screen name to “MorePreciousThan.” If The Hobbit, had come out in theatres that year maybe I would have gotten less ridicule, but about the nicest thing my peers could say to me was that it was a screen name for an 11-year-old girl.All in all, I’m glad we use facebook messenger where we use many real names for communication. I do miss the individuality that we could show with a screen name. Good memories of the late night, generally hormonally exciting conversations with people on the periphery of our peer group.﻿ (More than one of you did this) : I remember my screen name being something like MysticRift, as I was into the RIFTS role playing game and the Mystic class within. One chat interaction that sticks with me: I was just going back and forth with people in one of the main, general chat rooms (hey, remember those??) when this occurred: Mysticrift: I dunno, I just feel funny SomeRandomDude: *starts rubbing MysticRift to find out why she feels funny* Mysticrift: dude, 18/m/CA SomeRandomDude: No wonder you felt funny. I’m turning 38 in a few weeks, and I STILL remember how much a laughed at that. And of course, you posted~~~~ embarrassing away messages ~~~~: AIM is partly responsible for how quickly I’m able to type. Because I felt it necessary to carry on as many conversations with my friends as possible at the same time I became a really good typist. I’ve had to take typing test for jobs at which they were impressed with my speed/accuracy. I mostly have my many hours on AIM to thank for that. Beyond that, my away message and whatnot was usually some lyric because of course it was. Most likely 3rd Eye Blind or Savage Garden. But I had several different handles on there that I switched between depending on what I was needing to use it for or who I wanted to talk to. ﻿ A bunch of you found love: AIM is the reason I’m married to my husband. When I was in college I had a free Match.com account (meaning I could receive messages but not send anybody). At the time that was fine with me, because I was just curious about online dating sites but not actually interested in dating anybody through it. I might as well have been a bot, except that these days bots probably actually reply to people who send their messages. My husband had the foresight to leave his AIM username in his first message to me, which worked out well because without that I never would have talked to him.﻿ Or you found... something else: Mutual masturbation with girls in LA who are no doubt actually guys from Iowa﻿ Or you loved and lost : It was 20 years ago, we were in middle school, doing our homework together and messaging over AIM. I was fortunate enough to have a couple hour block of the line to use the dial-up, her family had two lines to the house. So it was routine of ours after our respective soccer practices to chat on AIM for a while, most of the school knew I liked her. It was one fateful fall afternoon, she teased that she liked some boy and was going to tell me at the end of my allotted dial-up time, which for once took forever to come...she messaged, “the boy I like is...[ClemsonEE]. =P” and promptly signed off. My world was spinning and I loved it. As most middle school romances go, this was special, I asked her to be my girlfriend in 7th grade, and she said no. I asked her to be my girlfriend in 8th grade, and she said no. I asked her to be my girlfriend in 9th grade, and she said no. But it didn’t stop us from talking most nights over the infallible AIM, filled with flirting and intimacy. I skipped asking her in 10th grade, took one of her friends to Homecoming instead, that was finally the tipping point, she finally was ready! We started dating the summer before junior year. The beautiful, first-love relationship. Voted class couple, went to Clemson together, left using AIM and went to G-Chat. We got married, adopted the most adorable black lab, life was looking great. Now we’re divorced, and AIM is shutting down. Good riddance AIM. (and I kept the dog)﻿ You argued with chat bots, sometimes without realizing it: Similar to SmaterChild I had found an app (wait, we didn’t call them ‘apps’ back then unless they were on the first page of the Applebee’s menu)—I found a program that was a bot that interfaced with a simple website where you could key in specific words and what the responses should be. The rest of it was up to the AI. A friend of mine at college managed to get some dormmates of his to add the bot as a friend, presumably not knowing what the setup was. I came home one night to a long drawn out argument in which the bot won. The bot was neutral, not instigating, so when it brought up its affection for the person’s mom I just about fell out of my chair laughing.﻿ You used it to get through more serious crises : on 9/11, I used it to let my friends know I was OK...and learned of several friends who were unaccounted for (later learned they didn’t make it)﻿ I remember helping a depressed guy get some treatment in the mid-90's. My wife thought it was super creepy and weird that you could chat with some stranger across the country, especially about personal things. I actually helped this guy though, and feel good about it.﻿ You hosted gift exchanges: avorite memory of AIM, group of friends, one year we all decided that we will host each other’s xmas list. One person will have another person’s list, post it on the profile, and when someone decided to get that gift, they will notify the person who has the list, and the item will be crossed out. I religiously stalked a friend’s profile to see what I am getting for Xmas. Great to be a teen again. Memory 2, how long people can stay on AIM without logging out.﻿ You pranked your friends for no reason: I remember when one of my college roomates hooked his AIM up to his phone for the first time. Shortly after, I wanted to get his attention so I just spammed him with something like 50 messages, all just “hey” or some variation of that. A minute or two later he stormed in all sorts of angry and pleading me to stop— apparently each of those messages cost him money since they were technically text messages. Whoops.﻿ You geeked out in role playing rooms: So many memories from the role playing rooms. Between the various niche communities like Xavier Institute ( X-Men RP ) and free form areas like Rhydin (Red Dragon Inn/The Forest). The place was like the nexus of existence where anyone or anything could show up. A gothic vampiress could be sipping bloodwine at the bar beside a 4 armed felidae prince who is the last of his kind while a dwarf was off in the corner snoring all cuddled up to his space pirate gf. Best memory besides meeting my first love in chat was the hour long battle I had with the Hulk that sent us from chat room to chat room crashing through the Rhydin Streets, Rhydin Falls, Rhydin Mall (I don’t know why there was a Mall but it was a hang out for skater rpers), etc. The saddest memory besides people trying to constantly force their own dice rules (your clan dice only work in your clans rooms, newb! 2d20 or GTFO) was when anime began invading. That and the realization of how many people were really just looking for cyber sex.﻿ And finally, you asked the tough questions: A/S/L?","For those of us who remember the early-ish days of the internet, today marks the official end of an era, that if we’re honest with ourselves, ended long ago: the heyday of AOL Instant Messenger.

Chris Welch,"Google’s March security update for Pixel phones also includes some much-needed functional improvements for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, as noted by Android Police. The company seems to have heard complaints from users about its latest phones becoming sluggish over time — especially the camera app. This month’s update promises to improve startup times and general responsiveness for the Pixel 3’s camera app. The March update also “improves storage performance on Pixel 3 devices,” meaning Google has been able to further optimize read and write speeds for the phone’s flash storage. Someone posted screenshots comparing storage performance before and after the update, and it does seem like a nice improvement. Both of those fixes are needed. Some owners have grown displeased with the Pixel 3’s inconsistent user experience several months after launch. Droid Life went off on the phone last month. And in his latest video, MKBHD detailed some of the frustrations he’s faced when using the Pixel 3. “I’ve had all kinds of various lag and performance issues with this Pixel after a couple of months,” he said. Google’s decision to give the devices just 4GB of RAM continues to draw criticism; many Android phones had already moved to 6GB or 8GB at the time the Pixel 3 launched, and the new Galaxy S10 can be purchased with up to 12GB RAM. Google fixed some of the worst early issues, like audio apps unexpectedly closing in the background. Not everyone is running into these problems — my own review device works about as well as I expect — but there are also others: Google has yet to completely fix a “screen flash” bug that makes the display brightly flash white when accessing the lock screen. But the camera fix is important, as the most notable thing about Google’s phone continues to be its best-in-class shooter. Back to this latest update: Google says it “improves Bluetooth reliability” on Pixel 3 and 3 XL. But Bluetooth seems to be a confounding technology for this company at times — just ask Pixelbook and Pixel Slate owners — so keep your expectations in check. And last, the March security update improves the recovery process if an OTA update fails, and it “improves playback of encrypted media on some video apps.” All of these improvements only apply to the Pixel 3, with no mention of the Pixel 2 or original Pixel. To download the March update, just head to settings, check for an update, and the installation process should begin automatically.","Google’s March security update for Pixel phones also includes some much-needed functional improvements for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, including faster startup speeds for the camera app.",2019-03-04T22:28:11Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Google tries to address complaints of sluggish Pixel 3 with latest update,https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250583/google-pixel-3-march-update-camera-storage-fixes,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGzjC-VaKQpfmsvc_3wz-fjpYYM=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13278387/jbareham_181010_2989_0217.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-2,1
Jonathan Shieber,"At the heart of our current President’s criticism is a claim that Amazon is making a mint and leaving a *failing* U.S. Postal Service holding the bag. It’s not a new critique from the Twitterer-in-Chief, but it is one that’s worth unpacking given the crippling effect technologies have had on the USPS — where email is even more reliable than a carrier undeterred by “ snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night. “ Is it failing? “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?” This infantile question was posed by President Trump on Twitter in December 2017. While it’s not clear what exactly prompted Trump’s criticism, the tweet did spark a wave of debate as to whether the Postal Service is indeed failing and, if so, whether Amazon is to blame. First of all, it’s true that the Postal Service is “losing billions of dollars a year” – $2.7 billion in 2017, to be more precise. In fact, the Postal Service has been losing money for over a decade. And the USPS does have a curious relationship with Amazon. While competitors UPS and FedEx charge the e-commerce giant $7-$8 per package, USPS only charges for $2 for the service. However, as with most stories, that of USPS is more complicated. USPS and Amazon The USPS-Amazon relationship may be seen as “dumb” by the 45th president, but to many it’s a piece of shrewd business on the part of the Postal Service. As of 2017, Amazon was USPS’s biggest customer, and an intelligent way for the independent agency – that traditionally made its money by having a monopoly on first class mail – to get a piece of the increasingly profitable package delivery pie. It’s not the first time that the Postal Service has tried to muscle its way in on the growing package delivery industry. Back in 2010, the entertainment company Netflix accounted for $600 million from its DVD subscription service. Of course, the Netflix DVD delivery service is fast fading and being replaced by on-demand streaming; and Amazon look to be preparing their own delivery service. It seems that the USPS may have to prepare itself to be jolted by another wave of disruption. One-Two Punch of Email and a Financial Crisis The Postal Service’s first major battle against the age of innovation came with the rise of email, and it didn’t take the beating that you might expect. Despite the fact that in 2002 the majority of Americans used email, the Postal Service still managed to make profit between 2003 and 2006. During this time, people were still writing letters, sending greetings cards and, perhaps most importantly, bills were still sent by post. It wasn’t until the 2007 global financial crisis that the Postal Service took a hit that, arguably, it still hasn’t recovered from. After thousands of businesses suffered from the crisis, they started to cut back on expenses wherever possible, and one such place was mail. Back in 2000, nearly two-thirds of bills were delivered by USPS, and the total revenue from bill payments in this year was estimated at between $15 and $18 billion. Between 2006 and 2010, USPS volume fell by 42 billions pieces, with 15 billion of those being caused by electronic billing. And if that weren’t enough, the rise of social media further confounded USPS’s problems. Between 2010 and 2014, postcard volume fell by 430 million. As more and more people began logging into Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat to send virtual Christmas cards and birthday wishes, fewer people were sending mail, and therefore fewer profits for the agency that had had its fair share of knocks in the 21st century. Innovating within a Risk-Averse Government To suggest that those in charge at the Postal Service have been idly watching as new technologies disrupt and threaten the agency would be unfair. It is an organization that looks to engage with the latest technology. For instance, in 2014, it released a white paper on the impact that 3D printing could have on the industry and how the Postal Service could benefit; and again in 2015 it released another on the Internet of Things. Both papers were clearly commissioned with a degree of prescience, being published before either technology had begun to pervade the public consciousness. Unfortunately, though, forward-thinking initiatives such as these have been blocked before they can enter the action stage. USPS’s status as a quasi government entity may have its benefits, such as a monopoly on all first class post, but in return Congress has a say in how the agency is run. It can outline the products and services provided by the Postal Service, and set its prices. However, unlike other Federal agencies, USPS receives no funding, and hasn’t done since 1982. In 2016, the Postal Service wanted to make the most of its relationship with Netflix and other video rental business, but the proposal was blocked by the Postal Regulatory Commission. In 2013, USPS attempted to end Saturday letter delivery – a change that would have saved $2 billion a year. The proposal was blocked by Congress. And in 2016, it was ordered to lower the cost of postage stamps from 49 cents to 47 cents, resulting in a $2 billion annual cost. At the heart of the troubled USPS-Congress relationship lies the problem. A big existential question mark hangs over the Postal Service’s head: what exactly is it? With 2.7 million people working for it, it’s the biggest employer in the US ( Walmart, by comparison had 2.2 million as of 2017). It also delivers to remote locations that private companies like FedEx and UPS won’t touch. For these reasons, it exists out of necessity. There are also those who want to see the Postal Service fully privatized or even abolished, believing it to be an outdated relic of nostalgia. Understandably, those within the Postal Service are equally unsure as to what they should be. On one side, they’re being encouraged to innovate and drive up profits, and on the other they’re being blocked making the changes necessary. As it stands, the USPS motto “neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds” still holds true. Their resilience through massive shifts in consumer behavior is nothing short of remarkable. They are at the service of the American people, and so it’s up to them to decide what they want it to be. Although it may be true to say the Post Office is losing money thanks to Congress and cutting Amazon a more-than-fair deal, its importance is far more nuanced and complex than he gives it credit. And without the Postal Service, it would be more than just Amazon that would be losing out. As the world moves to more and more virtual communication channels it will be fascinating to see USPS evolve.","Cyrus Radfar Contributor Cyrus Radfar is a founding engineer of AddThis, which was acquired by Oracle.

TEA, NEWS AND PREP When I wake up at 7, the city is quiet. You almost feel like the only one up, and I like that feeling. I am not a breakfast person, so Ill have a cup of tea and catch up on news, engage with the social media community; Ill go over my Nets scripts to prepare for games that week.

GET PUMPED I go to the 9:30 service at Redeemer Downtown on 14th Street, and I love hearing the sermon. It grounds me, reminds me how great God has been to me, my family and friends, and I leave more knowledgeable. Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer in Manhattan, is a well-known author, so I knew I wanted to check out his teaching when I came to New York. I found Redeemer and fell in love with the Bible-based teaching. Thats a priority to me. We can all preach on feelings, but teaching on truth is what I live for, and learn from.

SPIRIT AND BODY Right after church, I walk to 23rd Street and teach a 12:45 class at Peloton. Its a live class that is broadcast to all bikes and app members. Its literally my Feel Good Ride the name of the class as it allows me to bridge the gap of how great I feel from church and being on the bike, working out with thousands of riders at the same time, inspiring them through uplifting and encouraging language. I love Peloton because of its community. Its not only the leader in the hybrid of technology and fitness, but we are able to build social relationships that are magnified both on the bike, which uses a leader board that syncs with other riders, and off the bike, through real friendships across the country.
A LITTLE BUSINESS Ill get off my bike around 1:30 and meet with Faye Farrales, who helps me run Love Squad. Its really informal on Sundays, but were a small business, so its important to work in those off-peak hours and get ahead of the game so we know what were doing and build a strategy for the upcoming week.

HANG I meet my friends around 2:30 or 3 for afternoon brunch. My favorite place is Joseph Leonard on Waverly Place in the West Village. Theres usually a wait, so we have some drinks at the bar before sitting down. And it really depends on how much fun were having, but brunch can end anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30. When its over, Ill go home to change and meet my boyfriend, Andrew.

THE BOYFRIEND Andrew and I see each other every day. I start my mornings with him, and sometimes on Sundays he joins for church, and he often comes to class, as well, but we always meet up for comedy and dinner. At 8 we go to the stand-up show at the Village Underground on Third Street. We love to laugh, so comedy is perfect we thoroughly enjoy and respect those who can get up, live, and make people laugh. Making people laugh on the spot is real talent. Anyone can tell one good joke, but very few people can thread jokes together to tell a story, be impactful, and just make it super funny. My favorite comics include Hasan Minhaj, Stephen Colbert, Kevin James. After the show, we always go around the corner to Mint Masala on Macdougal Street for amazing Indian food. We love the curry chicken and lamb rogan josh.

Sean Keane,"The Airbus A350-900ULR will take the world's longest flights from Oct. 11 Singapore Airlines The first Airbus A350-900ULR arrived in Singapore over the weekend as Singapore Airlines prepares to launch the world's longest flights. Journeys between Singapore and New York will begin on Oct. 11, the airline said in a release, covering a distance of around 9,000 nautical miles (10,400 miles or 16,700 km) in about 18 hours and 45 minutes. It'll take the title of the world's longest commercial flight from Qatar Airways. The current title holder is a 18-hour nonstop journey between Doha, Qatar, and Auckland, New Zealand. The route will have a two-class layout, with 67 business-class seats and 94 premium economy-class seats. The A350-900ULR (for Ultra Long Range) completed its first flight in April, and can fly 20 hours nonstop with a full load of passengers. The airline will run three flights in the first week, increasing to daily from Oct. 18, Bloomberg reported. It'll use subsequent deliveries of the A350-900ULR for non-stop services to Los Angeles from Nov. 2.

STEPHANIE SAUL and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS,"Many districts and schools that are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation in what organizers call the National School Walkout are also calibrating their approach for their youngest students. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out. At Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized. Photo Craig Sampsell with his fifth-grade students at Case Elementary as they made posters for the upcoming walkout. Credit Dustin Franz for The New York Times “We’re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,” said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA. In suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join. In an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. “Sometimes I think when you’re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” he said. “Just to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I’m not sure what that is really teaching.” Even within Akron’s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all — students had not expressed an interest, according to the district. Elise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University’s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students — from kindergarten to second grade — and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: “Schools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.” Children in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. “They are reaching a point where having something that’s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,” she said. Ms. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students. “And if you can create that space,” she said, “whether that’s in the classroom or in the hallways or in the schoolyard or out at a protest or a march, that’s the most beneficial space for young kids to be in.” Photo Notes on a whiteboard about the coming walkout at Case Elementary, where activities will vary by grade. Credit Dustin Franz for The New York Times Some school districts, generally in conservative areas, are trying to discourage any type of school walkout, regardless of age, warning that any student who participates will be marked as absent from class. Even some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone. Ms. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly — the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. “We are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,” she said. “Whatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.” If some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. “The way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,” Ms. Peterson said. Joel Pelcyger, head and founder of the PS1 Pluralistic School, a private school in Santa Monica, Calif., consulted with parents before deciding that observing the walkout was not a political statement, but a way to empower his students and make them feel safe, regardless of age. “The way you make people safe is by feeling that like they’re part of something larger than themselves,” he said. But in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest. This is being organized by groups that want to ban all guns and are demanding congress act. Kids shouldn’t be used as props. — Julie Gunlock (@JGunlock) March 2, 2018 “My elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,” the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women’s Forum, said in an interview. “Some of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And it’s frightening to them.” Maeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names. Still, she thought it was time for children to do something. “Adults have been protesting against things,” she said on Monday, “but nothing has changed that much.” Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

Tribune News Service,"Jammu, March 8
A teenager who allegedly lobbed a grenade at the Jammu bus stand, killing two men, is under 16 years of age and he told interrogators that ""he was paid Rs 50,000 by a Hizbul Mujahideen militant for it"", officials said on Friday.
This signals that terror groups have again started using underage boys for creating terror among the people in Jammu and Kashmir.
The boy, who will turn 16 on March 12, was apprehended while fleeing after hurling the grenade at the bus stand that left two people dead and 31 others injured Thursday.
During interrogation, the juvenile told the police that he had been paid Rs 50,000 by a Hizbul Mujahideen militant for throwing the grenade, the officials said.
The officials said his Aadhaar card and other identity proofs, including school records, show his date of birth as March 12, 2003.
The interrogators will now conduct an age test on the boy before initiating legal proceedings against him, they said.
According to the investigators, self-styled district chief of Kulgam's Hizbul Mujahideen outfit Fayaz had passed on a grenade to an overground worker, Muzammil, for lobbing at a crowded place anywhere in Jammu.
Muzammil had developed cold feet and refused to throw it. He was then instructed to pass on the grenade to the boy who was codenamed ""chotu"".
The picture of juvenile was shown to Muzammil, who is at present in police custody, and he identified him as the person who had received the grenade, the officials said.
This was the third grenade attack by terrorists on Jammu bus stand since May last and it comes just three weeks after the Pulwama terror strike on February 14 that killed 40 CRPF jawans, bringing India and Pakistan on brink of war.
The attack was carried out around 11.50 am resulting in the death of Mohammad Sharik, 17, and and injuries to 32 others, including 11 from the Valley, 10 from Jammu and others from outside the state. One more person identified as Mohammad Riyaz succumbed to his injuries this morning.
The arrest of juvenile indicated that militant groups will be using underage boys for throwing grenades as they can escape the stringent punishment from law.
The boy is the eldest among the three children. He was studying in class ninth and his father is a painter by profession.
As per the law, he will be sent to a juvenile home and the state government might file a petition before an appropriate court asking for his trial under stringent anti-terror law provisions.
Terror groups in the state had been hiring underaged boys in early 2000 who were used for throwing grenades at security forces for a handsome monetary considerations.
However, the practice had come to an end by 2009 after police carried out effective counselling of parents in areas highly-infested by terrorism.

Stefan Etienne,"The way it should be done Dell’s latest 15-inch XPS 2-in-1 is a high-end laptop that appeals to creative users: people who need power and portability, and might also appreciate a touchscreen and a stylus. It plays in the same field as HP’s Spectre x360 15, Microsoft’s Surface Book 2, and Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Pro. Right out of the box, Dell gets most things right with the XPS 15 2-in-1, with a just few areas that need improvement. Its build quality, attention to detail, power, and flexibility add up to a high-end experience that matches its premium price. It’s fair to say you get what you pay for with the XPS 15 2-in-1. It starts at $1,299, but the model I’ve been testing costs nearly a grand more at $2,199. That price gets a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB of storage, a 4K touchscreen, and AMD’s integrated Radeon Vega M graphics. The most costly part of that is the 4K screen, so you can save quite a bit by opting for the 1080p panel. No matter which model you buy, the Vega M graphics come along for the ride. It’s a solid package that I’ve been able to live and work with — mostly in harmony. Looking at the XPS 15 2-in-1’s chassis is well, an unimpressive viewing — Dell’s XPS laptops have been using the same basic design language for years now and it looks dated. Most of the laptop is covered in metal topped with a silver finish, and when opened up, a faux carbon fiber palm rest. It has a rubberized, smooth texture that makes it by far one of the most comfortable palm rests I’ve used and despite being prone to fingerprints, it’s easy to clean. Dell’s build quality is unmatched Overall, the design might be boring, but the XPS makes up for that with excellent build quality. The palm rest, display, touchpad, and keyboard hardly exhibit any noticeable give — there are no wobbly underside or clicking fans here. However, the Dell XPS 2-in-1 isn’t a lightweight, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That’s more than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, Surface Book 2, and even some full-fledged gaming laptops. I don’t think anyone wants to walk around with a four-plus pound tablet, because it’s cumbersome and awkward to use, but since the XPS is a convertible, you can do that if you want. No one wants a four pound tablet The 360-degree hinge also lets you use the XPS in an easel or movie-watching mode, both of which are probably more practical than as a tablet. The hinge is quite sturdy and doesn’t have the horrible screen wobble so many 2-in-1s are plagued by. On the flip side, it’s very hard to open the XPS 15 2-in-1 with one hand, thanks to that stiff hinge and no cut out to slip your finger into. When it comes to ports, the XPS 2-in-1 reminds me of the not-so-loved 15-inch MacBook Pro: two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB-C 3.1 ports with DisplayPort, an audio jack, microSD card slot (I’m not sure what to do with it), lock slot, and a battery level indicator. There’s no full-size USB-A port — which is a travesty — and while I appreciate the forward-thinking of including USB-C, user adoption still isn’t high enough for me to swear it off, then have to buy a dongle. Dell does get your dongle collection started by including a USB-C to A adapter in the box, but I’d much rather just have the port built into the machine itself. Fortunately, you can charge the laptop using any one of the four USB-C ports. The screen on the Dell measures 15.6 inches (with a 16:9 ratio), has thin bezels, and supports Dell’s included stylus. It’s the highlight of this XPS 15 2-in-1 unit, because this 4K display pops. By default, Dell sets Windows 10’s display scaling to 250 percent, which makes everything comically large — moving it down to something like 225 or 200 percent lets you better take advantage of the screen’s real estate. It’s a gorgeous 4K screen Colors are bright, with tons of pop and contrast without too much image sharpening. The 4K option has 100 precent Adobe RGB certification (with some variance between displays), which is useful if you’re planning to do any serious image editing with it. Dell advertises 400 nits of brightness and while eyeballing it next to the Spectre 15-inch x360, the Dell definitely appears to be the brighter and better looking 4K experience. Dell deserves credit for including a capable stylus with the XPS 15 2-in-1, unlike HP, which throws in a basic one, or Microsoft that doesn’t give you any stylus at all. The included pen has 4,096 levels of pressure and is the closest equivalent to the Surface Pen I’ve tested. It’s a great stylus, has good weighting, and draws with precision. It also supports angle input for shading. The XPS 15 2-in-1’s keyboard is nearly as shallow as the MacBook Pro 15-inch, but other than that, there isn’t anything like it. It’s clickier, has better tactile response, and I find it more enjoyable to type on, overall. Also, it’s hopefully more reliable than Apple’s issue-prone keyboard. However, the backlight brightness is not as bright as I hoped and the Page Up and Page Down keys are unceremoniously located above the left and right directional keys — it’s just asking for an incorrect entry. Shallow keys, but they’re okay The trackpad is Precision-enabled, but is a tad small considering the overall real estate on the palm rest. Regardless, it has a fast, accurate input with support for all of Windows 10’s gestures, and the results are exactly what I look for: smooth. Dell makes it very easy to log in to the computer by supporting both fingerprint sign-in — via the power button — and facial recognition via the IR camera, located at the bottom of the display, under the “Dell” logo. The webcam placement is a sacrifice made for the thin bezel design, but as I’ve found out before ( and more than once ) it’s entirely possible to have thin bezels and place the webcam where it belongs — at the top of the screen. It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again: Dell’s camera placement means that all of your video calls will have horribly unflattering up-the-nose angles and your fingers will block the camera when you type. “This Dell rips,” are words that I’d rarely ever say, but they are true about this XPS 15 2-in-1. Processor-wise, the Core i7-8750G is a speedy quad-core processor — that part is well-known — but there is little (if any) crapware installed upon first booting the XPS 15 2-in-1. So your first few times using the system is clear-headed and uncluttered, as it should be. Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and other Adobe suite apps should have no issue running in large batch operations here. Didn’t expect light gaming performance Where the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me in terms of performance was with graphically intensive apps, or rather, games. League of Legends can run at a consistent 60 fps and full 4K resolution. Counter Strike: Global Offensive runs just as well, but a graphics-intense title like Rainbow Six: Siege requires some settings tweaks, to a lower resolution with less eye candy. It won’t hold a candle next to a purpose-built gaming laptop, but it’s still impressive because the XPS 15 2-in-1 wasn’t designed for gaming to being with. I’m used to seeing just five hours of battery life with 2-in-1 computers that have 4K touchscreens, but the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me with seven hours of use between charges. It’s not as long as you’ll get with an ultrabook or Microsoft’s Surface Book 2, but it’s on par with the 15-inch MacBook Pro and other powerful laptops. The light-up battery gauge on the left side offers limited info as to how much battery is left, but it is useful for eyeballing it. Dell has established the XPS 15 2-in-1 as one of the best laptops in its class. The XPS 15 2-in-1 blends all the benefits of having a 4K display, powerful chipset, and aesthetic integrity, without the user having to sacrifice too much battery life, excessive heat, or poor build quality. While the design choices of Dell still seem a bit dated, everything else about the XPS 15 2-in-1 performs as you’d expect… which is the right way. The 4K screen is an expensive upgrade The biggest issue might be the XPS 15 2-in-1’s price, which isn’t as high as a MacBook Pro or Surface Book 2, but still a significant cost. You can skip the 4K screen for a 1080 panel and save quite a few hundred dollars, while still maintaining many of the other qualities that make this XPS so good to use. You might even get better battery life and performance with the lower-resolution screen, but 4K just makes it that much better because of the Adobe RGB support and resolution. Although the XPS 15 2-in-1 is a very expensive laptop with a boring design, it does most everything it’s supposed to well, which might be enough to make you forget about its cost and sleepy styling.

""Of the required design disclosures (drawings), 26-percent have been issued, and the program is on a path to have 83-percent issued by construction start,"" Bill Couch, spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command, told Warrior Maven. The Columbia class is to be equipped with an electric-drive propulsion train, as opposed to the mechanical-drive propulsion train used on other Navy submarines. In today's Ohio-class submarines, a reactor plant generates heat which creates steam, Navy officials explained. The steam then turns turbines which produce electricity and also propel the ship forward through ""reduction gears"" which are able to translate the high-speed energy from a turbine into the shaft RPMs needed to move a boat propeller. ""The electric-drive system is expected to be quieter (i.e., stealthier) than a mechanical-drive system,"" a Congressional Research Service report on Columbia-Class submarines from earlier this year states. Designed to be 560-feet long and house 16 Trident II D5 missiles fired from 44-foot-long missile tubes, Columbia-Class submarines will use a quieting X-shaped stern configuration. The ""X""-shaped stern will restore maneuverability to submarines; as submarine designs progressed from using a propeller to using a propulsor to improve quieting, submarines lost some surface maneuverability, Navy officials explained. The Ohio-class ballistic missile sub USS Tennessee returns to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia on Feb. 6, 2013. Reuters Navy developers explain that electric-drive propulsion technology still relies on a nuclear reactor to generate heat and create steam to power turbines. However, the electricity produced is transferred to an electric motor rather than so-called reduction gears to spin the boat's propellers. The use of an electric motor brings other advantages as well, according to an MIT essay written years ago when electric drive was being evaluated for submarine propulsion. Using an electric motor optimizes use of installed reactor power in a more efficient way compared with mechanical drive submarines, making more on-board power available for other uses, according to an essay called ""Evaluation and Comparison of Electric Propulsion Motors for Submarines."" Author Joel Harbour says that on mechanical drive submarine, 80-percent of the total reactor power is used exclusively for propulsion. ""With an electric drive submarine, the installed reactor power of the submarine is first converted into electrical power and then delivered to an electric propulsion motor. The now available electrical potential not being used for propulsion could easily be tapped into for other uses,"" he writes. Research, science and technology work and initial missile tube construction on Columbia-Class submarines has been underway for several years. One key exercise, called tube-and-hull forging, involves building four-packs of missile tubes to assess welding and construction methods. These structures are intended to load into the boat's modules as construction advances.

Naval Base Kitsap/Flickr ""Early procurement of missile tubes and prototyping of the first assembly of four missile tubes are supporting the proving out of production planning,"" Couch said. While the Columbia-Class is intended to replace the existing fleet of Ohio-Class ballistic missile submarines, the new boats include a number of not-yet-seen technologies as well as different configurations when compared with the Ohio-Class. The Columbia-Class will have 16 launch tubes rather than the 20 tubes current on Ohio boats, yet the Columbias will also be about 2-tons larger, according to Navy information. The Columbia-Class, to be operational by the 2028, is a new generation of technically advanced submarines intended to quietly patrol the undersea realm around the world to ensure second-strike ability should the US be hit with a catastrophic nuclear attack. Formal production is scheduled for 2021 as a key step toward fielding of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines to serve all the way into and beyond the 2080s. General Dynamics Electric Boat has begun acquiring long-lead items in anticipation of beginning construction; the process involves acquiring metals, electronics, sonar arrays and other key components necessary to build the submarines. Both the Pentagon and the Navy are approaching this program with a sense of urgency, given the escalation of the current global threat environment. Many senior DoD officials have called the Columbia-Class program as a number one priority across all the services. ""The Columbia-Class submarine program is leveraging enhanced acquisition authorities provided by Congress such as advanced procurement, advanced construction and multi-year continuous production of missile tubes,"" Couch added.","US Department of Defense The Navy has now issued at least one-fourth of the design work and begun further advancing work on systems such as a stealthy ""electric drive"" propulsion system for the emerging nuclear-armed Columbia-Class ballistic missile submarine…",2018-06-19T18:14:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Themaven.net'}",The Navy is making progress on the stealthy 'electric drive' system that will power its new Columbia-class missile sub,https://www.themaven.net/warriormaven/sea/navy-columbia-class-submarine-quieting-electric-drive-stealthiest-sub-ever-Fp7ECemSWkutRMTV1Gv5tg/,https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/54aea15fecad04044ac2714d-2732-1366.jpg,,Themaven.net,class-2,1
Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Lyft Inc’s initial public offering on Thursday marked the latest chapter in the seven-year journey of the U.S. ride-hailing app, from a startup backed by seed funding to a publicly traded company worth more than $27 billion. 
Early investors along for the ride now stand to make what they invested dozens of time over. Lyft’s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, now hold stakes valued at $675 million and $415 million, respectively. 
The following is a list of the biggest winners from the IPO. Valuations of the Lyft stakes are based on the company’s share price as of midday Friday: 
Logan Green 
Value of Lyft stake: $675 million 
The co-founder and chief executive officer of Lyft owns 684,591 class A shares and 7,689,182 class B shares and holds a 2.9 percent stake in the company. Class B shares have the same economic value as class A shares but 20 times the voting rights. 
John Zimmer 
Value of Lyft stake: $465 million 
The co-founder and president of Lyft owns 684,591 class A shares and 5,090,527 class B shares. He holds a 2 percent stake in the company. 
Rakuten, Inc 
Value of Lyft stake: $2.5 billion 
The Japanese e-commerce company, which invested $300 million in Lyft in 2015 at a $2.5 billion valuation and then made subsequent cash infusions, is the company’s largest shareholder with an 11 percent stake. Its chief executive officer, Hiroshi Mikitani, sits on Lyft’s board. Rakuten owns 31,395,679 class A shares. 
General Motors 
Value of Lyft stake: $1.5 billion 
The Detroit automaker invested $500 million in Lyft in 2016. The companies have partnered on autononmous driving efforts, but have become more competitive partly as a result of GM’s acquisition of Cruise Automation, an automated driving startup, later in 2016. GM owns 6.5 percent of Lyft. 
Fidelity Investments Inc 
Value of Lyft stake: $1.5 billion 
The Boston-based financial services company has invested more than $800 million in Lyft, partly the result of leading a $600 million investment round in 2018 that valued Lyft at $15.1 billion. It owns 18,544,716 class A shares and has a 6.5 percent stake in the company. 
Andreessen Horowitz 
Value of Lyft stake: $1.2 billion 
The Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm led a $60 million investment round in Lyft in 2013 and invested more capital the following year. Its co-founder, Ben Horowitz, sits on Lyft’s board. It owns 15,040,924 class A shares and holds a 5 percent stake in the company. 
Alphabet Inc 
Value of Lyft stake: $1 billion 
Alphabet led a $1 billion financing round for Lyft in 2017 that valued the company at $11 billion through its Capital G venture capital arm. Alphabet also invested a small amount through its Google Ventures. It owns 12,828,964 class A shares and David Lawee, a partner at Capital G, sits on Lyft’s board. Alphabet owns 4.5 percent of Lyft.

Jeff Powers,"What if I told you that, just like modern VR was born from smartphone technology, the next generation of smart homes will share technology with autonomous vehicles? The centerpiece is machine learning-based activity prediction. We’ll get to how that works and what it means, but first, let’s look at what’s wrong with today’s smart homes. Smart homes today consist of smart devices connected to one or more hubs, often with voice interfaces via smart speakers or smartphones. There may be cameras, but they are largely for monitoring and security. Turning on lights with voice feels magical at first, and remotely checking home devices like thermostats is useful. We’ll call current smart homes “Class 1”: a collection of internet-connected devices that respond to direct commands, and have basic responsiveness. Have you visited TNW's hype-free blockchain and cryptocurrency news site yet? It's called Hard Fork. There’s a problem with Class 1 homes: the operational complexity grows with each new device. New voice commands. New device names. New errors. Besides the novelty, the complexity growth negates the value of the smart home, also making them unusable to older generations who didn’t grow up using computers. But there’s a solution: “Class 2” smart homes. A smart home with new technologies that are each complex, yet culminate in a simple system…even as device count grows. Class 2 homes will be distinguished by always-on predictive assistance – a system that enhances the day-to-day interactions that comprise our relationship with where we live. Unlike current smart homes where we rely on devices (like smartphones) for control, Class 2 homes will have built-in interfaces using cameras, displays and speakers. You’ll express intent with movements, gaze, gestures, and voice (but we’ll eliminate wake-up commands like “Alexa.”) Class 2 homes will learn and map your house – including inanimate objects like the 19th century heirloom dresser, making “dumb” objects interactive via computer vision (and possibly robotic assistance). Why predictive ? When you do things at home, you have intent which is conveyed by your location, movements, gaze, gestures and (quite rarely) voice. Imagine a Class 2 home that measures these supplemental signals in addition to your voice. Imagine this home is set up for your grandparents. Grandma won’t need to memorize the den lights’ name. Rather, she can say “Turn on the lights.” Meanwhile, when she’s in the den for too long, her home can realize she left the stove on in the kitchen, and give her a reminder, or turn the stove off itself. Via automatic activity recognition, the smart home could remind grandpa to water the plants by the front door, as he’d done it every week until now. No complex setup. No syntax to remember. For older generations, this Class 2 home is, finally, simpler to operate than the good old fashioned way. For younger generations, the Class 2 home enhances ordinary tasks as if you’re Batman with Alfred in your earpiece. For instance, you might find a few ingredients in your fridge, gesture at them and ask, “what can I make?” A recipe will appear on a display for an exotic dish. Because your smart home is already aware of what is missing from your pantry, a doorbell ring will alert you to the arrival of a rare spice required for the finishing touch. So how does this all work? Remember the three cutting-edge technologies we referenced in the title? Here they are: visual perception, semantics, and, most importantly, activity prediction. Let’s look at each one. Visual Perception and Mapping: Class one smart homes largely rely on audio assistants to enable capabilities. These assistants analyze 44,000 samples per second to understand commands. While that seems impressive, it pales compared to the billions of pixels a class two smart home continuously consumes to inform its model of your home. The compute required for this processing exceeds that inside a fleet of the most powerful self-driving cars. Semantics and Activity Recognition: While our homes may appear to be static, the people and situations within are highly varied and changing. Identifying, classifying and tracking this ever-growing set within a home requires machine learning that goes beyond today’s ML classifiers. In particular, combining an understanding of people (and, in the case of homes, pets) and what they do requires a new branch of ML: activity recognition. For instance, if you’re on the couch and looking towards a television, you’re probably watching TV. In addition, we need not just train a system on the activities people do, but also who in a home partakes in which activities. Activity Prediction: This is it – the cornerstone of the class two smart home. It is also the most sophisticated element, and making it work requires integrating research at the cutting edge of machine learning. While activity recognition adds new levels of classification tasks to multi-factor problems, activity prediction goes one step further to be informed by complex webs of learned patterns, behaviors, and other contextual information unique to each person and scenario. This prediction requires an incredible amount of training data. It took Microsoft 300,000 images to train the original Kinect to track human body motion from a single frame. It will take orders of magnitude more data to understand and predict activities. Does any of this sound familiar? Surprisingly, these are the same underlying technologies that are starting to power self-driving cars. Roadways and obstacles are mapped, activities and types of vehicles and pedestrians are recognized, and self-driving systems predict the future to find the best route and avoid unsafe situations. We’re not far off from realizing these technologies in the home. Compute power is increasing at an incredible pace, consumers can now map their homes in 3D, and home robots are reaching consumer adoption. Complex technology aside, this won’t matter if it doesn’t simplify life for everyone. How long until that happens? You’ll know the Class 2 smart home has arrived when grandma doesn’t call to ask for tech support for her smart home, but instead tells you how to get it to do something you didn’t even know was possible.","What if I told you that, just like modern VR was born from smartphone technology, the next generation of smart homes will share technology with autonomous vehicles?

Eric Berger,"Enlarge / Robb Kulin, at Ellington Field. reader comments 2 A little more than a year ago, NASA introduced its newest class of 12 astronaut candidates. These talented men and women were chosen from a deep pool of 18,300 applicants, and after two years of training they were to join the space agency's corps for possible assignment on missions to the International Space Station, lunar orbit, or possibly the surface of the Moon. However, one of those 12 astronauts, Robb Kulin, will not be among them. On Monday, NASA spokeswoman Brandi Dean confirmed to Ars that Kulin had resigned his employment at NASA, effective August 31, ""for personal reasons."" Sources described Kulin as a ""family man,"" confident in his abilities. A native of Anchorage, Alaska, Kulin was a mechanical engineer who came to NASA from the rocket company SpaceX, where he had been a senior manager for flight reliability. ""Hopefully, I will one day fly on a vehicle that has components that I got to design,"" Kulin said in June 2017, during a news conference announcing the new astronaut class. It is rare for an astronaut ""candidate,"" or ascan in space agency parlance, to drop out of training before completing this work and becoming assigned to the astronaut office, said Robert Pearlman, a space historian. “The last time that a NASA astronaut candidate resigned before being qualified for a potential spaceflight assignment was 50 years ago, in 1968,"" said Pearlman, editor of the space history news website collectSPACE. ""Chemist John Llewellyn, a member of NASA's sixth group of trainees and second scientist-astronaut group selected in 1967, withdrew from the program a year later after realizing he was not cut out for flying jets. An August 1968 NASA release announcing his departure stated, 'Dr. Llewellyn said it became apparent several weeks ago that he was not progressing as he should.'"" NASA's 2017 class of 12 astronauts, seven men and five women, were the space agency's 22nd group of trainees since the original Mercury 7 astronauts were selected in 1959. They group ranged in age from 29 to 42 at the time.

Brian Pascus,"In an effort to increase customer comfort and get a leg up on the competition, Delta Air Lines recently renovated all of the seats within its fleet of Boeing 777-200s. On Monday, Delta announced a ""full fleet interior renovation"" that has made the width of its economy class seats 18.5 inches. For comparison, American Airlines and United Airlines seats are 17 inches wide. ""The upgraded 777 design is part of Delta's multi-billion dollar investment in the overall customer experience,"" the airline said in a statement on its media website. The biggest change for travelers is in economy class (known as Main Cabin extra). Fliers in those seats now have more room to spread their legs. Previously, Delta used an industry standard 3-3-3 seat arrangement for economy class — that being three seats at the left window, four in the middle, three at the right window. Delta's new Main Cconfigurationation will feature nine seats across — three in each section, nine total — rather than the standard 10 across issued by American Airlines and United Airlines. ""The comfort of our customers—across all cabins—is a top priority,"" Delta spokesperson, Savannah Huddleston, said in a statement to Business Insider on Thursday. ""That's why we've committed to remain at 9-abreast seating in the Main Cabin as we modify our 777s, versus the new norm of 10 across. With 9-abreat, we're able to offer wider Main Cabin seats - the widest of our international fleet - and more preferable seat options."" The wider seats come with a personal power outlet for passengers and an 11-inch TV screen for them to watch movies or shows. This sounds pretty impressive, especially when considering earlier this year American Airlines announced it will be eliminating screens on the back of seats in its 737s. Another cool improvement is Delta's premium economy section, called Premium Select. This smaller section of the plane has only eight seats across (structured in a 2-4-2 format) to ensure greater legroom and more space for passengers to move around the cabin. Finally, Delta's first class cabin (known as ""Delta One Suites""), now has sliding door accesses to a private cove filled with entertainment options, a personal table, and a 24-inch wide reclining seat. According to Forbes, the newly renovated Delta 777-200 will have 296 total seats: 220 seats in Main Cabin, 48 in Premium Select, and a precious 28 in Delta One Suites.

Shannon Liao,"I couldn’t decide if I wanted to play MapleStory 2 when it was released globally in October. I had eagerly anticipated it since its South Korean launch in 2015, but now that it was here, I needed to see if my friends and boyfriend — whom I met in the original MapleStory — wanted to join, so that I would have a guild and people to party up with on quests. It wasn’t long before they seemed bored by it. During the beta testing phase this May, hardly anyone was approved to be a beta tester, so the worlds of Maple were lonesome. Then in the weeks leading up to MapleStory 2 ’s global launch, nobody said a word in my Discord channel. Nobody, it seemed, cared. That included me — I planned to spend this winter getting comfy with my PS4, trying some visual novels. During this time, at the end of September, I was out on vacation for three weeks, surfing the web on a VPN, not interested in Google or Discord while I was in China. I may have missed the increasing hype around MapleStory 2 as old fans decided to pick up the game. My obsessions while in China were the shopping app Taobao and the food delivery app Meituan, which gets you midnight snacks for a 2 to 3 RMB service fee ($0.29 to $0.44). Little did I know that my entire Discord horde was busy buying founders’ packs that grant you extra boosts, designing their little Lego-like houses, buying cute clothes, and upgrading weapons in MapleStory 2. Image: Nexon But once I landed in New York again, I saw that my friends had their real names as usernames. Short, crisp, five-letter names that contain references to early anime, Twitch streams, and company values. (The last one was my boyfriend, who bought his founder’s account off the black market after he returned from China, struggled to find a username, and settled on using his company’s value of accountability. He got his other username by looking at his jury duty summons. Yeah, I know.) Getting my account up to speed became of paramount importance. So immediately I began training and leveling my character — a priest — to level 50, only to be irked by her insufficient damage. I started over and set my sights on a different character, a more powerful class. I debated whether I should play an assassin, a wizard, or a weird hybrid of the two: a rune blader. I randomly went with the wizard and got stuck on picking a username. This is when the delight of playing MapleStory 2 unexpectedly revealed itself. I’ve already beta tested MapleStory 2. I know what this game is and what happens when you get to the end — you’re bored and lonely, and there’s nothing left to do but to explore the world. But what the beta version was missing — the enormous MapleStory community of children and teenagers now grown up as college students and young professionals — meant that I was only playing a shell of a game. It’s the thrill of knowing others are also striving to make their characters the silliest-looking or the most lovable, that clever names are well sought after, and that when you are looking for a party quest, five other strangers at any time will immediately join you. These are the things that make this game meaningful. I sat there for hours trying every nice word I could think of until I finally landed on a four-letter word username that others hadn’t taken yet: Leit, as in leitmotif. (I also created characters named Enlarge and Colonial, but those don’t have quite the same appeal for obvious reasons.) Image: Nexon In beta, virtually any word was available, which sucked the joy out of this exquisite hunt. The same goes for building a house. You’re afforded so much free space and furniture, but the act of laying the bricks and intricate details is tiresome if nobody ever knocks on your door. I’ve come to the conclusion that MapleStory 2 lives or dies by how many people are playing it together. And while that’s true for most massive multiplayer games, it’s especially true for Maple, because its fan base is largely people who grew up with the original, and enjoy the nostalgia factor. No one really plays Maple for its quests and content. One of the most popular activities in the original MapleStory, and it remains that way in the sequel, is letting your character stand in the middle of a town square while you’re physically away from the game. You might not be playing, but you’re showing off your appearance and stats to onlookers. That doesn’t have quite the same appeal when nobody is looking.",MapleStory 2 was released globally in October. This version of Maple is somehow a lot more fun than the beta in May.

Janaki Jitchotvisut,"If you travel frequently for business, you've probably wished for the convenience and luxury of a private jet at least once. The allure of ample legroom, gourmet meals, and top-flight spirits — along with strong WiFi — is powerful in the extreme. Now imagine you could have an experience like this — but at prices closer to what you'd pay for first-class commercial aviation. That's the experience that Aura plans to launch in 2019. Initially, flights will go between six major US cities: NYC, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Denver, and Los Angeles. Aura is using specially redesigned Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft to seat just 29 passengers per flight — 21 in the lower-tier First class and just eight in the higher tier Wave class. They're streamlining the airport experience. Aura is contracting with private airports in the cities it serves — which will translate to passengers needing to arrive a mere 20 minutes before boarding. If you're a frequent air traveler, the time savings alone could be worth it to you. Aura has two ticket tiers. The seats in First allow plenty of room to stretch. AURA Currently, Aura plans to launch with both member and non-member pricing schemes — and like any similar service, subscribers will pay less for tickets. Subscribers — known as Keyholders — will pay $100 per month, which allows unlimited flight access at fixed fares that are, at most, half the cost of what non-subscribers will pay. Since non-member flight prices will fluctuate with demand, Keyholders may actually pay less than half that price. The First seats fully recline, too. Fly Aura Customers purchasing seats in First will find an experience similar to first class on a commercial flight — only on a smaller, more luxurious plane. Seats are placed in a 2 to 1 configuration with legroom at a 44 inch pitch. If that's not luxe enough, Wave class will allow you to fully recline on special AÏANAWAVE zero-gravity seats that were designed in consultation with sleep psychologists and aero-medical scientists. Food, drink, and other amenities will give you a sense of home while flying A seasonal rotating menu of what Aura calls ""fusion tapas"" and sushi will be available to all passengers. A full bar including both soft and alcoholic beverages will also be available to all passengers. There are plenty of amenities. AURA Wave class passengers will also have full dining service available from Aura's Meatlocker.

Daniel Bader,"Best Overall Google Pixel 2 See at Verizon See at Google Store For two years, the Pixel has been the quintessential Google phone, and the HTC-made Pixel 2 is our top recommendation for shoppers in need of a small phone. The Pixel 2 wields the same Snapdragon 835 processor as almost every other 2017 flagship, but sits in a class of its own when it comes to performance. It's comfortable to hold thanks to a relatively small 5"" 1080p display, and features front-facing speakers, water resistance, and one of the best cameras on the market. Despite a seemingly small 2700 mAh battery, it even manages impressive battery life. Bottom line : For the Google purist in search of a small phone, the Pixel 2 is the pretty much the complete package. One more thing : The Pixel 2 lacks a headphone jack and wireless charging, though it does include a USB-C audio dongle in the box. Why the Google Pixel 2 is the best It's Kinda Just Clearly the best Android phone money can buy. There's no better way to experience Android the way Google intends it than with a Pixel phone. The Pixel 2 dispells the notion that small phones can't offer a flagship experience, with the same specsheet and performance as the larger Pixel 2 XL — without its various known issues. The Pixel 2 is the first Google-branded phone with IP67 water resistance, and the first to offer front-facing speakers since the Nexus 6P. It also takes some of the best photos we've ever seen from a phone with its 12.2 MP primary camera, and the front-facing camera can capture great-looking selfies, even offering Portrait Mode by making use of machine learning. Google also sweetens the deal by including free unlimited backups on Google Photos for Pixel 2 owners. You can buy the Pixel 2 in one of three attractive colors (Kinda Blue, Just Black, and Clearly White), and two storage options (64GB or 128GB), though there's no microSD expandability so choose wisely. Best for camera buffs Huawei P10 See at Amazon Not feeling what Samsung and Google have to offer? Try the Huawei P10 instead. This 5.1-inch device comes packed with a whole host of goodies, including 64GB of storage, Android 7.0, and a dual camera that's made in partnership with Leica. The P10 also boasts Portrait Mode, which works a lot like what you see produced by your friends who utilize it on the iPhone X, and it's equipped with optical image stabilization, too. All this runs on Huawei's own Kirin 960 processor and 3200mAh of all-day battery. Bottom-line: The Huawei P10 is a worthy choice if a good camera and all-day battery life are you main concern. One more thing: The Huawei P10 will only work with GSM carriers. Verizon and Sprint are not compatible with this phone. Best affordable phone Moto G5 Plus See at Amazon The Moto G5 Plus is one of the best smartphone deals today. It's compact but not tiny, with a 5.2-inch Full HD display, and it packs a lot for that metal chassis, including a Snapdragon 625 processor and an excellent 12MP rear camera. The 3000mAh battery lasts a while, and the ultra-simple Nougat-based software is about as good as you'll get for the price. Bottom-line: The Moto G5 Plus is an excellent choice if you're looking for an affordable unlocked phone in a compact size. One more thing: If you want to save a bit of money, you can go with the Amazon Prime Exclusive version. Best ""really tiny"" phone Xperia XZ1 Compact See at Amazon Sony's Compact line has always offered flagship-tier specs and features in small phones, and the Xperia XZ1 Compact is no exception. With a Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, and a 2700mAh battery, its spec sheet is identical to the larger Xperia XZ1. Its display is only 720p, but at 4.6"" it still has a respectable 319 ppi. The XZ1 Compact has an excellent 19MP camera with a physical shutter button, IP68 water resistance, microSD expandability, and Quick Charge 3.0. Even better, the XZ1 Compact is one of the few devices available right now with Android 8.0. Bottom-line: You won't find another sub-5"" phone with such high-end specs, and it's made even better with Android 8.0 Oreo on board. One more thing: The fingerprint sensor integrated into the power button is excellent, but it's disabled by the U.S. firmware. Conclusion The Pixel 2 is simply the best compact Android experience around. You get pure Google software, a best-in-class camera, water resistance, front-facing speakers, and top-end specs, all in a small form factor that can easily fit in your hand or pocket. As always, it can be a bit difficult to find certain configurations in stock, but once you get your hands on one, the Pixel 2 leaves little to be desired — except maybe a headphone jack and wireless charging.

Sherisse Pham,"Wixen Music Publishing accused Spotify of using artists' music ""without a license and without compensation,"" according to documents filed in a California court on Friday. Wixen handles copyright management and royalty compliance for artists including Tom Petty, The Doors, Neil Young and Missy Elliot. Petty's ""Free Falling,"" Rage Against the Machine's ""Calm Like A Bomb"" and more than 10,000 other songs are listed in the lawsuit. Wixen is seeking damages of $150,000 per song, the maximum award possible under the U.S. Copyright Act. Related: Siri, what's that song? Apple buys Shazam According to that act, there are two separate copyrights for every recorded song: one for the sound recording and one for the musical composition (the song's words and musical notation). Wixen says Spotify ""took a shortcut"" when it struck deals with major labels to get the necessary rights to the songs' sound recordings, but then failed to obtain the equivalent rights for compositions. Spotify, which is based in Sweden, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday outside of regular business hours. Related: Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' sells a million copies in four days The lawsuit is just the latest copyright headache for the music-streaming service. In May, Spotify settled a class action lawsuit with a group of songwriters for $43 million. The songwriters had accused Spotify of using their songs without a license and without paying royalties. Wixen handles copyright management and royalty compliance for artists including Tom Petty. Spotify is currently facing three other lawsuits in Tennessee that were filed by songwriters and music publishers. In those cases, Spotify is also being accused of using songs without paying royalties to publishers and songwriters. Spotify is reportedly valued at $19 billion. The company is expected to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange this year.

"Steve Garrison steve.garrison@nwi.com, 219-853-2563","CROWN POINT — A man faces charges after his toddler daughter shot her pregnant mother with his gun Tuesday outside Plato's Closet in Merrillville, court documents state. Menzo M. Brazier, 21, of Michigan City, was charged Thursday in Lake Criminal Court with two counts each of criminal recklessness and neglect of a dependent. Police were dispatched about 3:38 p.m. Tuesday to Plato's Closet, 359 E. 81st Ave., for reports of a gunshot wound. Officers found Brazier at the store holding a blood-soaked towel against his pregnant girlfriend's chest, according to court records. The woman had a gunshot wound that entered the upper right side of her back and exited near her collar bone. The woman was transported to Methodist Hospitals Southlake Campus and then Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois, where she was treated in their intensive care unit, records state. She told police in a statement her 3-year-old daughter accidentally shot her with her boyfriend's gun. The father told police his girlfriend was sitting in their vehicle with their children, ages 3 and 1, while he was shopping for pants inside Plato's Closet. He said he did not want to bring his loaded 9 mm handgun into the store, so he put it between the front passenger seat and center compartment. He said he was inside shopping when someone entered the store and said a woman outside was bleeding. He went outside and found his wounded wife leaning against the side of their car. Brazier allegedly admitted the gun was loaded, but claimed a bullet was not chambered. He said he told his daughter not to touch his guns or knives, records state. Brazier was wanted by police on a warrant for failure to appear in Porter County Superior Court on traffic violations, records state. The defendant was arrested on the warrant. He remains held without bond at Lake County Jail, records state.

Spotify is going after podcasts in a major way in 2019.
The music streaming service confirmed that it has snapped up two podcast networks Gimlet and Anchor in undisclosed deals. But thats not all: Spotify also said it has plans to spend a further $400 to $500 million on multiple acquisitions in 2019 to get even deeper into the space.
2. Meditation app Calm hits unicorn status with fresh $88 million funding
As meditation grows in popularity across the U.S. the CDC says it tripled from 4.1 percent in 2012 to 14.2 percent in 2017 Calm has capitalized on the craze by offering a suite of mindfulness and wellness tools, from guided meditation sessions to a product called Sleep Stories, via a subscription.
3. Instacart faces class-action lawsuit regarding wages and tips
The suit alleges Instacart intentionally and maliciously misappropriated gratuities in order to pay plaintiffs wages even though Instacart maintained that 100 percent of customer tips went directly to shoppers. Based on this representation, Instacart knew customers would believe their tips were being given to shoppers in addition to wages, not to supplement wages entirely.

Ahrendts joining Apple in 2014 was massive news, with her having served as the CEO of the luxury fashion brand Burberry from 2006 to 2014. She led the charge to reimagine Apples retail stores, shifting them to what she hoped felt more like a modern-day town square.

Whats the difference between Main Stage interviews and Q&amp;A Sessions? So glad you asked. Main Stage events occur in the largest auditorium and are live-streamed on TechCrunch.com around the world. Q&amp;A Sessions are specifically for Disrupt SF attendees to extend the conversation with speakers and take place in a smaller, more intimate space. A TechCrunch editor moderates a panel of experts, and they take questions submitted from the audience. Its the perfect time to take a deeper dive into a topic or to follow-up on an issue raised during a Main Stage or Extra Crunch Stage presentation.
Main Stage events are recorded, live-streamed and theyre also available later, on demand not the case with Q&amp;A Sessions. The only way to benefit from the content is to be there in person. Better plan to arrive early if you want a seat. Theyre very popular, space is limited and admission is strictly first come, first served.

Rita Liao,"China’s largest search engine Baidu is getting an offline revenue boost after it led a $300 million strategic round in Xinchao Media, a company that shows people ads when they’re waiting for an elevator – or stuck in one. The tie-up will see the partners collaborate on data integration that knits reams of search data from Baidu with Xinchao’s offline data. Baidu also says it will “empower” Xinchao with its big data algorithms and artificial intelligence technology, which, in other words, could make elevator ads more relevant as Xinchao has now deciphered people’s online behavior. Xinchao will also join Baidu’s expanding network of “screen” ads distributors that target audience across cinemas, office buildings, smart TVs, or the little display screen at one’s local supermarket. The partnership appears to show promise given that Baidu commands 80 percent of China’s search market, according to Q1 data from market research firm Analysys. Xinchao, on the other hand, claims to run ads in 700,000 elevators in more than 100 Chinese cities. The funding comes on the heels of Alibaba’s hefty $2 billion investment into Focus Media, a main rival to Xinchao that claims to have a reach of 200 million middle-class consumers across 300 cities in China. Like Baidu, Alibaba makes a big chunk of its revenues by charging marketing fees. Despite its pivot to an “AI-first” firm, which has given birth to projects from autonomous driving to smart speakers, Baidu still devises most of its revenues from search ads. In the third quarter, online marketing made up 80 percent of Baidu’s total revenues. Though Alibaba and Baidu do not compete directly in their main business – ecommerce and search engines, respectively – they do grapple with each other for the advertising market. Baidu’s alliance with Xinchao could help it fend off Alibaba’s growing partnerships with brick-and-mortar retailers, a setup that could potentially expand the ecommerce firm’s advertising footprint. As of 2017, Alibaba controlled 33 percent of China’s online advertising market, while Baidu trailed behind at 24 percent, according to Analysys. Tencent held a less significant share at 13 percent.","China’s largest search engine Baidu is getting an offline revenue boost after it led a $300 million strategic round in Xinchao Media, a company that shows people ads when they’re waiting for an elevator – or stuck in one.

The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark’s first visit to the last 16 since 2002. • Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland. • With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game. • One of Denmark’s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, “What I can say about Eriksen is, he’s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He’s the most important player for Denmark.” The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension. • These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Denmark won theat game, with Peter Schemichel, father of current keeper Kasper Schmeichel, in goal. • Croatia is a comfortable favorite to win, with Denmark 4-1 or so.

No, this isn't a shot of someone's quarters on NCC-1701D, it's is a promo shot of Singapore Airline's new first class suite. Lee Hutchinson says he's determined to try out the suite (or maybe Emirates version) at least once before he's too infirm to leave the sofa. ""Preferably without even a stopjust get off one plane and get back on the other. that way i dont even have to care about the time zones or do any clock adjustment,"" he told Ars. 
Yet another insane Singapore Airlines A380 suite. I think I agree with Lee on this one 
Ok, you saw the official Singapore Airlines press shots, now this is what it actually looks like. 
This is what a Singapore Airlines first class suite looked like in 2009. 
Singapore Airlines also has a rather fancy bathroom in first class upstairs.

This must be downstairs on a Lufthansa Airbus 380 because it's a 3-4-3 layout. 
On Valentine's Day, Airbus confirmed that production of the massive A380 airliner will come to an end, breaking some plane nerds' hearts. When it was unveiled to the world in 2005, Airbus touted its efficiency over twin-engined long-haul planes, but this mighty carbon-fiber double-decker never lived up to expectations. Not all airports could accommodate its physical size, and getting the self-loading cargo on and off could take a while.
Unlike the 747, it doesn't appear set to have a continued career carrying cargo, either. You'd expect the biggest passenger plane of the skies to make a pretty decent freighter. But there's no folding nose variant, so you can't take full advantage of its commodious interior to carry really big stuff. In 2021, the last A380 will depart final assembly in Toulouse, France. By then, more than 300 of these carbon composite skywhales should have been delivered, and so we expect they'll remain a regular sight at airports they already service.
The Airbus superjumbo never really captured the public's heart the way the 747 has, and there's no denying the decision to put the cockpit on the lower deck gives the plane a hydrocephalic appearance. But the complex curvature of the wing is a thing of beauty, and it's always wonderful to see something so large land so gracefully. (If you time your visit to the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy annex for the right time of day, you can watch them come in up on the observation deck.)
Flying long-distance in an A380 can be an opulent affair. Both Singapore Airlines and Emirates have private first class suites on board, and the flying barfirst seen on the original jumbo jethas made something of a comeback, too. The promo shots have a certain air of ""crew quarters on NCC-170D,"" although you'll see from the gallery(or on YouTube) that they're a little smaller than that. Further aft things are more spartan, and pick the upper deck because the 2-4-2 layout is less cramped than downstairs' 3-4-3.
I've only been fortunate enough to fly an A380 once (of late 747s appear to be the preferred type for Dulles to Heathrow). But that one trip made me fall for the big plastic bird. It was a quiet and smooth ride, and the bathrooms at the front of the upper deck were bigger than the bathrooms of some houses I've lived in. Here's to you, you majestic flying cruise liner.

TINA ROSENBERG,"The Netflix model is an example of delinkage: pricing schemes that decouple rewards for pharmaceutical innovation from a drugs price. Another example is to offer a drugmaker a big prize for new drugs that matter to society. Prize funds could provide lower prices, broaden access to medicines and incentivize the creation of important drugs rather than big-selling drugs. Senator Bernie Sanders regularly introduces the Medical Innovation Prize Fund Act and another bill proposing a fund for H.I.V. drugs. The legislation goes nowhere.
Theres one category of drugs where delinkage is no longer controversial, and thats antibiotics. The world desperately needs more antibiotics, as even some second-line ones are failing because of overuse. 
But any new antibiotic must be used extremely sparingly only when all current antibiotics fail in order to stave off its own failure. The current pricing model rewards selling as much as possible, which is the opposite of what you want. Thats why we havent seen a new class of antibiotics in 30 years.
A prize fund could persuade companies to work on antibiotics. Democratic legislators regularly introduce a bill to lower medicine costs that includes a $2 billion prize for new antibiotics. A different, bipartisan bill would reward a company that makes a new class of antibiotics with a years patent extension on another of its drugs potentially worth billions.
Less dramatically, theres an organization named CARB-X, for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, founded in 2016 at Boston University School of Law. CARB-X members include the United States, British and German governments, foundations like Gates and the British Wellcome Trust, and a network of scientific and business experts. It offers funding and scientific and business help to small companies. Kevin Outterson, a law professor who directs CARB-X, said six companies are already in human trials with new drugs.
The new ingredient in all this is public outrage, which can help apply a counterweight to the might of the pharmaceutical industry. Political will matters. Australia said were not going to settle for 10 percent coverage, said Dr. Moon, the lead author of the study of Australias program. Were going to find a way to 100 percent. If other governments were to follow that course of action, theyd get results, too.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by George Dvorsky to Gizmodo","Thanksgiving will never be the same for families in Flint, Michigan, the city that made national news in 2015 for its lead-contaminated drinking water. Mae Collins, 50, is no exception. Her annual family tradition has changed drastically since 2014, when city officials switched the city’s drinking water source to the Flint River, turning tap water into brown filth. Since then, using tap water—for cooking, bathing, drinking—has felt like a gamble for Collins, a risky rolling of dice, even now when the state deems the city’s water lead levels acceptable ( while still recommending residents use a filter ). “Why you gon’ tell us to use our filters, but you say all the lead is out the water?” Collins told Earther, speaking to the city’s recommended water instructions. “It’s been a long time since we sat at home and really ate a good holiday dinner.” In the years before the water crisis, Collins used to spend Thanksgiving at home. She kept it more intimate, cooking for her seven kids and her husband’s five kids, not worrying about water bottles or lead. She misses cooking elaborate dinners—homemade mac and cheese, boiled green beans, and, of course, turkey. Since last year, Collins and her family have been heading to her sister’s house in Flint. Everyone is responsible for a single dish. That way, no one has to deal with the overwhelming stress that comes from cooking an entire Thanksgiving dinner water bottle by water bottle. Collins only has to worry about the water required to boil green beans; her husband will handle the frying of the turkey. “It’s been a long time since we sat at home and really ate a good holiday dinner,” Collins said. “Because you don’t feel like moving all that water and cooking.” Water’s not the only new factor, though. Health and nutrition now take a larger seat at the dinner table, too. The menu hasn’t changed much, but there’s a newfound respect for what family members put into their body. There’s also a fear of what will come if families don’t take care of themselves, as some research points to food as a way to keep lead from traveling through the body. “You don’t know, you probably so scared, you wanna’ stay protected,” Collins said about her new habit of eating healthy. “As long as you in Flint, you wanna’ stay protected.” Throughout the city, doctors and nutritionists are offering families a sense of protection through food. Aside from taking extreme caution with the water, fresh fruits and vegetables might be the only way to keep further lead poisoning at bay—especially for the city’s youngest warriors. Junetta Eubanks is another mom in Flint. She knew something was wrong with her water in 2014, as soon as she noticed a rash on two of her children. She’s a 33-year-old mother of six, so she took no risks. She knew the city had switched its water source. From that day on, the family bathed only with a Brita shower head filter and drank only bottled water. “We started doing bottled water instantly, and within a few months, we got a water cooler in our house,” Eubanks told Earther. She’s grateful she and her husband reacted proactively: She was pregnant during the water crisis, and three of her children were younger than 6. Junetta Eubanks and her husband, Ladell. Photo Courtesy of Junetta EubanksDrinking lead-contaminated water that young can change a child’s life forever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say no level of lead in blood is safe for a kid that young, but blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter put a child at an even higher risk for impacts to their brain and nervous system that can delay development and cause comas, convulsions, and even death. Junetta Eubanks and her husband, Ladell. Photo Courtesy of Junetta EubanksAt the time, residents still had no idea how severe the contamination was. Before the water source switch, roughly 2 percent of kids in Flint tested positive for elevated blood levels, according to state data. After? A whopping 7 percent. Flint kids were 50 percent more likely to see their blood levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter while the city was connected Flint River water. Eubanks’ kids saw low blood lead levels, which she attributes to her family’s proactiveness. Still, she won’t take any chances. The family is more committed now to healthy eating than ever, which has instilled a new appreciation for all types of plants. Like kale. The mom never ate the hearty vegetable before she was made aware of its nutritional value. Now she’s always cheffing it up. “I started cooking it like I cook my greens,” she said. “The kids can’t tell difference, and it tastes great.” Everyone knows they should eat healthily; this is true around the world. In Flint, however, eating healthy represents hope. Scientists are just beginning to explore the science behind keeping lead already in the body out of the bloodstream. They do know that low iron is associated with elevated blood lead levels, at least according to some studies. So foods high in iron—like spinach and lentils—should, in theory, help mitigate some negative lead health impacts. Vitamin C is another potential lead fighter, as various bodies of research have shown that children with higher vitamin C intakes have a lower chance of elevated blood lead levels, especially when coupled with high-iron diets. “Some of the recommendations, although they’re good recommendations, they’re not different from what I would recommend, as a nutritionist, to anyone.” Calcium is another mineral that might help mitigate the effects of lead exposure, but the research is conflicting. “It makes sense that low calcium intake would be related to greater lead absorption,” per one analysis, but studies are inconsistent in whether calcium actually keeps lead in the bones and away from other organs. No food, however, can reverse lead exposure. And most lead mitigation studies have been done on kids with higher blood lead levels than those Flint has seen or on animals, as the aforementioned analysis pointed out. To Michigan State University Professor of Food Science and Human Nutrition Amy Saxe-Custack, the science still feels too flimsy to make specific recommendations. “Some of the recommendations, although they’re good recommendations, they’re not different from what I would recommend, as a nutritionist, to anyone,” she told Earther. Saxe-Custack directs nutrition activities with the Pediatric Public Health Initiative Group, a partnership between Michigan State University and the Hurley Medical Center Children’s Hospital that came together last year in light of Flint’s health crisis. The group wants to make sure the city’s children have the best chances for success. Lead in particular poses dangerous risks to a child’s development. It can impact a child’s IQ, ability to pay attention, and academics. Nutrition and early childhood education are what Saxe-Custack and many other professionals say children exposed to lead really need. In Flint, this is easier said than done, though, especially when it comes to good food. The city is what we’d call a food desert. These are neighborhoods the U.S. Department of Agriculture defines as ones that “lack healthy food sources.” For some families, that might look like a grocery store that’s more than a mile away—without access to public transportation. Or maybe a family’s grocery store options are very limited. Flint has seen a pattern of grocery stores closing in recent years. But in wake of the lead crisis, the city isn’t standing by: Community members and public health advocates have rallied to bring fresh healthy foods into Flint. Chef Sean Gartland hosts a six-week long nutrition and cooking class every Tuesday at the Flint Farmers Market. The market’s modernized lead-free water pipe infrastructure makes it an ideal location to prepare food. The catch with the class? It’s just for kids. The current class has 10 kids who range from 8 to 17 years old. Most of them live in Flint, and most are black. The Public Health Initiative Group has been offering the class to parents at the Hurley Medical Center since October, after the group received a $50,000 grant from an anonymous foundation to make it happen. The idea is to teach kids what makes a healthy meal and then give them the tools they need to cook it themselves—after they decide on what they want to cook, of course. This class is indicative of a food revolution in Flint. It’s a culmination of work that kicked off in 2015, immediately after the greater public became aware of the water crisis. Saxe-Custack is there every week to analyze the class, take photos and video, and conduct focus groups. “The kids are really enjoying it,” she said. “We have several picky eaters whose parents want them to come to the class to get them to try more foods and try new foods, so the perception at least is that that’s working. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped expose the blood lead levels of Flint’s children, helped spearhead the effort as part of a broader push to help eradicate the city’s food desert issue and foster a sense of wellness. In 2015, the Hurley pediatric clinic, where she works, moved to the new farmers market location downtown. With the farmers market, the clinic, the new cooking class, and the YMCA all near each other, the Wellness Hub was born. Already, research has shown that this new farmers market location drew more residents from “the most distressed neighborhoods,” as a study published last year put it. Now that people like Hanna-Attisha and Saxe-Custack are working together to make this food more affordable, they expect even more low-income and residents of color to buy their groceries at the farmers market. “You don’t have to spend your money on a lot of fruits and vegetables.” One of the ways they’re doing this is through fruit and vegetable prescriptions. Hurley pediatric clinic patients receive a $10 prescription—which is increasing to $15 around December—for fresh fruits and vegetables at the farmers market. Any time they come in for a checkup or doctor’s visit, patients receive a prescription. Saxe-Custack explains that many have come to expect it and ask if a medical resident or doctor forgets to offer. “The parents are reminding them,” Saxe-Custack said. “So they’ll come to the clinic and say, ‘Hey, aren’t I supposed to get a fruit and vegetable prescription?’ And that’s kind of nice, too, that the families are getting used to it and expecting it.” The farmers market is only open on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, but parents can also pick up a produce bag the market produces at the clinic. In 2016, the medical center handed out roughly 4,221 prescriptions with more than 61 percent of parents redeeming the vouchers, per data Saxe-Custack provided Earther. And this isn’t the only place where Flint residents can go to find the foods necessary to cook their Thanksgiving dinner. Two mobile food markets have set up across the city. Flint Fresh, a local food nonprofit, is behind the mobile markets, and it even offers online orders. Saxe-Custack is working with the nonprofit to see how the prescriptions could be used through it, too. This is food that technically costs money, though, even if through a prescription. Free food options exist, too, especially for people who are already receiving federal food assistance. There’s Double Up Food Bucks, which gives users even more money to spend toward fresh fruits and vegetables when they buy foods at participating locations. There are also food pantries; some are even mobile. Two mobile pantries exist in Flint, providing free fruits and vegetables to any resident who wants them. “This is something that’s been going on in the community for a long time,” said Yvonne Lewis, the outreach director for the Genesee Health Plan, to Earther. “But as a result of the water crisis and the lack of access to grocery stores that have fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis, more churches and community groups started having them on weekly basis.” Collins is a fan of the food pantries. The food is free, so it makes her life a little bit easier, especially since her household relies on just her husband for income. “There is some good in it,” she said. “You don’t have to spend your money on a lot of fruits and vegetables.” Collins still looks at the holiday season with joy. The memories are deeper than a turkey that required bottles and bottles of water to clean. The time Collins gets to spend with everyone—like her seven sisters—is priceless. She looks forward to her cousins coming in from New York. They didn’t make it last year because of, well, the water. “It was sad, but hopefully they’ll come this year,” she said. If not, she won’t be alone. She’ll have the rest of her family and the love that’s flourished in their homes regardless of what’s spewing out of their faucets. No amount of lead—or empty plastic water bottles—can diminish that.","Thanksgiving will never be the same for families in Flint, Michigan, the city that made national news in 2015 for its lead-contaminated drinking water.

In this article, you can learn how to build the animated note display from the Awwwards website. It discusses the HTML5 SVG circle element, its stroke properties, and how to animate them with CSS variables and Vanilla JavaScript.
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is a standard XML-based markup language for vector graphics. It allows you to draw paths, curves, and shapes by determining a set of points in the 2D plane. Moreover, you can add twitch properties on those paths (such as stroke, color, thickness, fill, and more) in order to produce animations.
Since April 2017, CSS Level 3 Fill and Stroke Module allow SVG colors and fill patterns to be set from an external stylesheet, instead of setting attributes on each element. In this tutorial, we will use a simple plain hex color, but both fill and stroke properties also accept patterns, gradients and images as values.
Note: When visiting the Awwwards website, the animated note display can only be viewed with browser width set to 1024px or more.
A demo of the final result (Large preview)
File Structure
Lets start by creating the files in the terminal:
 mkdir note-display
 cd note-display
 touch index.html styles.css scripts.js
HTML
Here is the initial template that links both css and js files:
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Note Display&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./styles.css""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;script src=""./scripts.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Each note element consists of a list item: li that holds the circle, the note value, and its label.
List item element and its direct children: .circle, .percent and .label. (Large preview)
The .circle_svg is an SVG element, that wraps two &lt;circle&gt; elements. The first is the path to be filled while the second is the fill that will be animated.
SVG elements. SVG wrapper and circle tags. (Large preview)
The note is separated into integer and decimals so different font sizes can be applied to them. The label is a simple &lt;span&gt;. So, putting all of this together looks like this:
&lt;li class=""note-display""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
The cx and cy attributes define the circles x-axis and y-axis center point. The r attribute defines its radius.
You have probably noticed the underscore/dash pattern in classes names. Thats BEM, which stands for block, element and modifier. It is a methodology that makes your element naming more structured, organized and semantic.
Recommended reading: An Explanation Of BEM And Why You Need It
To finish the template structures, lets wrap the four list items in an unordered list element:

You must be asking yourself what the labels Transparent, Reasonable, Usable and Exemplary mean. The more acquainted you get with programming, you will realize that writing code is not only about making the application functional, but also assuring that it will be long-term maintainable and scalable. That is only achieved if your code is easy to change.
The acronym TRUE should help decide if the code you write will be able to accommodate change in the future or not.
So, next time, ask yourself:
Transparent: Are code changes consequences clear?
Reasonable: Is cost benefit worth it?
Usable: Will I be able to reuse it in unexpected scenarios?
Exemplary: Does it present high quality as an example for future code?
Note: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz explains TRUE along with other principles and how to achieve those through design patterns. If you havent taken some time to study design patterns yet, consider adding this book to your bedtime reading.

By combining the rules display: flex in the body and margin-auto in the .display-container, its possible to center the child element both vertically and horizontally. The .display-container element will also be a flex-container; that way, its children will be placed in the same row along the main axis.
The .note-display list item will also be a flex-container. Since there are many children for centering, lets do it through the justify-content and align-items properties. All flex-items will be centered along the cross and main axis. If youre not sure what those are, check out the alignment section at CSS Flexbox Fundamentals Visual Guide.
.note-display {
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 margin: 0 25px;
}
Lets apply a stroke to the circles by setting the rules stroke-width, stroke-opacity and stroke-linecap that altogether style the stroke live ends. Next, lets add a color to each circle:
.circle__progress {
 fill: none;
 stroke-width: 3;
 stroke-opacity: 0.3;
 stroke-linecap: round;
}
.note-display:nth-child(1) .circle__progress { stroke: #AAFF00; }
.note-display:nth-child(2) .circle__progress { stroke: #FF00AA; }
.note-display:nth-child(3) .circle__progress { stroke: #AA00FF; }
.note-display:nth-child(4) .circle__progress { stroke: #00AAFF; }
In order to position the percent element absolutely, its necessary to know absolutely to what. The .circle element should be the reference, so lets add position: relative to it.
Note: For a deeper, visual explanation on absolute positioning, please read How To Understand CSS Position Absolute Once And For All.
Another way of centering elements is to combine top: 50%, left: 50% and transform: translate(-50%, -50%); which position the elements center at its parents center.
.circle {
 position: relative;
}
.percent {
 width: 100%;
 top: 50%;
 left: 50%;
 position: absolute;
 font-weight: bold;
 text-align: center;
 line-height: 28px;
 transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
.percent__int { font-size: 28px; }
.percent__dec { font-size: 12px; }
.label {
 font-family: 'Raleway', serif;
 font-size: 14px;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 margin-top: 15px;
}
By now, the template should be looking like this:

Fill Transition
The circle animation can be created with the help of two circle SVG properties: stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset.
stroke-dasharray defines the dash-gap pattern in a stroke.
It can take up to four values:
When its set to an only integer (stroke-dasharray: 10), dashes and gaps have the same size;
For two values (stroke-dasharray: 10 5), the first is applied to dashes, second to gaps;
The third and forth forms (stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 and stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 3) will generate dashes and gaps in various sizes.
stroke-dasharray property values (Large preview)
The image to the left shows the property stroke-dasharray being set from 0 to 238px, which is the circle circumference length.
The second image represents the stroke-dashoffset property that offsets the beginning of the dash array. It is also set from 0 to the circle circumference length.
stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset
 properties (Large preview)
To produce the filling effect, we will set the stroke-dasharray to the circumference length, so that all of its length gets filled with a big dash and no gap. Well also offset it by the same value, so it gets hidden. Then the stroke-dashoffset will be updated to the corresponding note value, filling the stroke accordingly to the transition duration.
The properties updating will be done in the scripts through CSS Variables. Lets declare the variables and set the properties:
.circle__progress--fill {
 --initialStroke: 0;
 --transitionDuration: 0;
 stroke-opacity: 1;
 stroke-dasharray: var(--initialStroke);
 stroke-dashoffset: var(--initialStroke);
 transition: stroke-dashoffset var(--transitionDuration) ease;
}
In order to set the initial value and update the variables, lets start by selecting all .note-display elements with document.querySelectorAll. The transitionDuration will be set to 900 milliseconds.
Then, we iterate through the displays array, select its .circle__progress.circle__progress--fill and extract the r attribute set in the HTML to calculate the circumference length. With that, we can set the initial --dasharray and --dashoffset values.
The animation will occur when the --dashoffset variable gets updated by a 100ms setTimeout:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
 progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = 50, 100);
});
To get the transition starting from the top, the .circle__svg element has to be rotated:
.circle__svg {
 transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
Stroke properties transition (Large preview)
Now, lets calculate the dashoffset value — relative to the note. The note value will be inserted to each li item through the data-* attribute. The * can be switched for any name that suits your needs and it can then, be retrieved in JavaScript through the elements dataset: element.dataset.*.
Note: You can read more about the data-* attribute on MDN Web Docs.
Our attribute will be called data-note:
&lt;ul class=""display-container""&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""7.50""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;

 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Exemplary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The parseFloat method will convert the string returned by display.dataset.note into a floating point number. The offset represents the percentage missing to reach the maximum score. So, for a 7.50 note, we would have (10 - 7.50) / 10 = 0.25, which means the circumference length should be offset by 25% of its value:
let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
Updating the scripts.js:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
 progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
});
Stroke properties transition up to note value (Large preview)
Before we move on, lets extract the stoke transition to its own method:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
- let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
- let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
- let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
- let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
- progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
- progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
- setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ strokeTransition(display, note);
});
+ function strokeTransition(display, note) {
+ let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
+ let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
+ let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
+ progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
+ progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ }
Note Value Increase
There is still the note transition from 0.00 to the note value to be built. The first thing to do is to separate the integer and decimal values. We will use the string method split() (it takes an argument that determines where the string will be broken and returns an array containing both broken strings). Those will be converted to numbers and passed as arguments to the increaseNumber() function, along with the display element and a flag indicating if its an integer or a decimal.
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let [int, dec] = display.dataset.note.split('.');
+ [int, dec] = [Number(int), Number(dec)];
strokeTransition(display, note);
+ increaseNumber(display, int, 'int');
+ increaseNumber(display, dec, 'dec');
});
In the increaseNumber() function, we select either the .percent__int or .percent__dec element, depending on the className, and also in case the output should contain a decimal point or not. Weve set our transitionDuration to 900ms. Now, to animate a number from 0 to 7, for example, the duration has to be divided by the note 900 / 7 = 128.57ms. The result represents how long each increase iteration will take. This means our setInterval will fire every 128.57ms.
With those variables set, lets define the setInterval. The counter variable will be appended to the element as text and increased on each iteration:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
 element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Infinite counter increase (Large preview)
Cool! It does increase the values, but it kind of does it forever. We need to clear the setInterval when the notes achieve the value we want. That is done with clearInterval function:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
+ if (counter === number) { window.clearInterval(increaseInterval); }
element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Finished project (Large preview)
Now the number is updated up to the note value and cleared with clearInterval() function.

Bush, California agreed to adopt more stringent standards for light bulbs two years ahead of the rest of the nation. There are still an estimated 250 million incandescent bulbs in use in California and replacing them will save $1 billion in electricity costs annually, according to estimates published by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental advocacy group. “There’s been an LED revolution — your computer, the headlight in your car, your flashlight, you name it,” said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the council. “It’s just a superior technology.” There are a few exceptions to the ban. Incandescent bulbs will still be allowed to illuminate the inside of ovens and clothes dryers.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","Because getting a college education isnt expensive enough, the fees for taking the SAT and ACT tests as part of the admissions process can be a hardship for many high school students and their families.
Vox breaks down the costs:
Currently, it costs $47.50 to take the SAT ($64.50 with the Essay portion), and $22 for each of the SAT subject tests, not including the $26 registration fee. The ACT costs $50.50 ($67 with the Writing portion), and for each test there are extra costs for late registration. Advanced Placement (AP) tests cost $94. 
Add in the fact that many college counselors recommend taking the test multiple times to use the best scores, and the numbers can get out of hand very quickly.
Some colleges and universities are de-emphasizing the need for SAT and ACT test results, particularly if students meet a minimum grade point average or class rank. Functionally speaking, however, these tests are still very much ingrained in the college application process. 
Low-income high school students may qualify for fee waivers, though, if they meet certain requirements. The College Board details who is eligible for SAT fee waivers, as well as how to apply:
Youre eligible for fee waivers if you say yes to any of the following:
Youre enrolled in or eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
Your annual family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
Youre enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., Federal TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
Your family receives public assistance.
You live in federally subsidized public housing or a foster home, or are homeless.
You are a ward of the state or an orphan.
Similarly, the ACT fees are waived for students who meet these criteria:
1. They are currently enrolled in high school in the 11th or 12 grade.
2. Are testing in the United States, U.S. territories or Puerto Rico.
3. Meet one or more of these indicators of economic need:
Are enrolled in a federal free or reduced-price lunch program at school, based on the USDAs income levels.
Are enrolled in a program for the economically disadvantaged, such as federally funded programs like GEAR UP or Upward Bound.
Reside in a foster home, is a ward of the state or is homeless.
Family receives low-income public assistance or lives in federally subsidized public housing.
Familys total annual income is at or below USDA levels for free or reduced-price lunches on the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.
Contact your childs school counselor for help with the fee waiver application process or to determine whether you qualify.

I’m out.” Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times Twitter feuds claimed another high-profile casualty on Tuesday when the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates deleted his account after sparring with the Harvard professor Cornel West. It started on Sunday, when Mr. West published an article in The Guardian calling Mr. Coates “the neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle,” and accusing him of “fetishizing white supremacy” while ignoring “Wall Street greed, U.S. imperial crimes or black elite indifference to poverty.” Mr. West, a professor of philosophy at Harvard (and a sporadic Twitter user), then posted about his article, calling Mr. Coates’s views about race in America “dangerously misleading.”. @tanehisicoates fetishizes white supremacy. His analysis/vision of our world is too narrow &amp; dangerously misleading, omitting the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies, &amp; the complex dynamics of class, gender, &amp; sexuality in black America https://t.co/FytA7mLmNV — Cornel West (@CornelWest) Dec. 17, 2017 The tweet drew hundreds of responses from friends and supporters of Mr. Coates, including the New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb, who picked apart what he called Mr. West’s “threadbare commentary.” 2.

But it was also retweeted by the white supremacist Richard Spencer, who added, “He’s not wrong.” It feels like this might have been the straw that broke the camel's back for Ta-Nehisi Coates -- Richard Spencer endorsing Cornel West's criticism of him. pic.twitter.com/GrlZEcnzMj — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) Dec. 19, 2017 Late on Monday, Mr. Coates, who had more than 1.25 million Twitter followers as of earlier this month, tweeted, “Peace, y’all. I’m out. I didn’t get in it for this.” And at some point after that, he deleted his account. Richard Spencer agreed with Cornel West’s article about Ta-Nehisi Coates, and TNC had enough, said, “peace, y’all. I’m out.” Then deactivated. pic.twitter.com/bIdkozg9hs — Zachary (@zatchry) Dec. 19, 2017 It wasn’t the first time Mr. West had taken aim at Mr. Coates.

Gabe Gurwin,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar’s latest evolution of the open world formula, as it aims to deliver a living world that you explore naturally. In the latest gameplay trailer, we get to see just what kind of activities Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang will get to do in the Wild West. As an outlaw, Arthur Morgan won’t be involved in the most legal of errands as he’s out and about in the open world. The trailer shows the various ways Morgan can rob the average citizen, including a train or bank heist, stagecoach robbery, or just by holding up a shop owner at the local store. You can even just sneak into a house to steal what you find, or “go loan sharking” — in this case, that seems to involve beating someone up until they give you the money you’re owed. Unlike in Grand Theft Auto V, where only the police chase after you if you’re “wanted,” in Red Dead Redemption 2 you’ll also have to worry about bounty hunters. They don’t particularly care about taking Arthur in alive, and they might ambush him when he least expects it. You can also chase down bounties yourself, if you feel like playing on the other side of the law. As Rockstar previously mentioned, the “deadeye” sharpshooting system seen in Red Dead Redemption has been expanded in the sequel, allowing for even more badass moments. In addition to targeting enemies’ body parts to do more damage, you can slow down time after setting off an explosion to take out baddies in the aftermath. Of course, if you’re not interested in theft or murder, there are still plenty of options in Red Dead Redemption 2. We get a taste of these in the video, including wood chopping, table games, fishing, riding a mine cart, dancing, and doing that dumb knife trick from Aliens. We can’t wait to see if Red Dead Redemption 2 can deliver on the very lofty promises Rockstar has set. We’ll find out when the game launches for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on October 26. No PC release has been announced yet, and it’s unclear if the game will come to the platform at all.","The latest gameplay video for Red Dead Redemption 2 shows off a huge number of side activities and missions, including bounties, train robberies, duels, dancing, fishing, gambling, and more.

Steven Dufresne,"Levers are literally all around us. You body uses them to move, pick up a pen to sign your name and you’ll use mechanical advantage to make that ballpoint roll, and that can of soda doesn’t open without a cleverly designed lever. I got onto this topic quite by accident. I was making an ornithopter and it was having trouble lifting its wings. For the uninitiated, ornithopters are machines which fly by flapping their wings. The problem was that the lever arm was too short. To be honest, as I worked I wasn’t even thinking in terms of levers, and only realized that there was one after I’d fine-tuned its length by trial and error. After that, the presence of a lever was embarrassingly obvious. I can probably be excused for not seeing a lever right away because it wasn’t the type we most often experience. There are different classes of levers and it’s safe to say that most people aren’t even aware of this. Let’s take a closer look at these super useful, and sometimes hidden mechanisms known as levers. Levers Are One of the Oldest Mechanisms Archimedes Claw lifting ship. Image source Drexel University Technically speaking, levers predate humanity. You find them in biology — your forearm is a good example which I’ll go into later in the article. When it comes to man made mechanisms, levers are suspected to have been used as long ago as Ancient Egypt for lifting large block and obelisks but the earliest writings of their working principle come from followers of Aristotle and from Archimedes, both dated around 300 BC. Archimedes gave this static description of it: Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights. He also famously said, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.” Putting this into practice, he’s reputed to have devised a defensive weapon called the Claw for fighting off ships attacking city walls. Historical accounts seem to describe a crane sitting on the wall which lowers a grappling hook onto attacking ships and lifts them out of the water, capsizing or sinking them. Lever Principles As shown here, a lever consists of a beam which pivots on a fulcrum. A force, called the effort F e is applied at some distance a from the fulcrum. And a load F l exists at some distance b from the fulcrum. The law of the lever states that: The ratio of the force at the load to the effort force is equal to the ratio of the distances of those forces from the fulcrum. Mathematically, it can be stated as: MA = F l /F e = a/b MA stands for Mechanical Advantage and is a measure of how much the force is amplified. The formula shows that if length a from the fulcrum to the effort is greater than length b from the fulcrum to the load, then the mechanical advantage will be greater than one. Note that we’re not talking about free energy here. The power input is equal to the power output, ignoring losses due to friction, wear, and bending of the lever beam. Power is force multiplied by velocity and they differ proportionately from each other. If a &gt; b then the load will move more slowly than the point where the effort is applied (which must move a greater distance in the same amount of time). Classes of Levers Levers can be arranged in different ways and are described in three classes, all of which follow the law of the lever. Class 1 Levers Class 1 is perhaps the most familiar. Examples of that are a seesaw, a crowbar as well as any time you’ve picked up a stick and placed it on a handy pivot point to lift something heavy at the other end of the stick. A pair of pliers are class 1 levers which we use very often but rarely recognize them as such. Class 2 Levers With a Class 2 lever, the fulcrum is moved to one end of the lever, with the load in the middle and the force at the other end. Every time you pick up a wheelbarrow you use a class 2 lever, with the wheel’s axle is the fulcrum. Class 3 Levers The arrangement of the class 3 lever can be the most difficult to visualize. The fulcrum is still at one end of the lever, but the effort is now in the middle, with the load at the opposite end. It’s harder to think of everyday class 3 examples but we’ll see three of them below. When we look at an exoskeleton arm, a human arm, and a rubber band driven ornithopter wing we’re viewing class 3 levers. James’ Exoskeleton Levers I searched for a great example of a lever in a hacker made project and came up with a great one by our very own [James Hobson]. He built an exoskeleton with arms for lifting heavy loads. Interestingly, each arm contained both a class 1 and a class 3 lever. The arm is actuated by pistons. The main difference between class 1 and class 3 levers is that the load and the fulcrum have been switched. Here you can see that the location of the rear piston creates a class 1 lever, the location of the front piston creates a class 3 lever. You can see him use the rig to curl a 170 pound barbell. Human arm as a class 3 lever. Image source: Robotpark Levers In The Human Body With all its muscles, bones, and joints, it should be no surprise that the human body makes abundant use of levers. However, they’re not always used for mechanical advantage. In the case of lifting a load by raising the lower arm and using the elbow as the fulcrum, the effort is provided by a muscle in the upper arm. This muscle is attached to the lever (the bone) very close to the fulcrum, meaning that a is short compared to b, which extends from the fulcrum to the load in the hand (in the diagram, R stands for Resistance). Therefore the mechanical advantage a / b is less than one. Instead, the benefit here is that a small movement of the bone at the muscle produces a large movement at the hand. This makes for a compact and agile arm which can be useful in tight spaces. A lifting muscle which instead extends from the shoulder to near the wrist would get in the way much of the time. Note that James has done a similar thing with his exoskeleton arm, though he added the second piston to push while the other pulls/lifts. The Ornithopter’s Lever The typical rubber band powered ornithopter has a fuselage running down the middle that acts as the main body to which all the parts are connected. At the bottom of the ornithopter’s fuselage is a crank which is turned by a twisted rubber band. Connecting rods connect the wings to the crank. Turning the crank raises and lowers the wings through the connecting rods. This raising and lowering can be seen clearly in the animated GIF. Looking at the diagrams, the fulcrum is in the middle of the ornithopter, at the top of the fuselage. It’s there where each wing pivots as they flap up and down. The load is actually the air pressing on a wing membrane as the wing is pushed up or pulled down, though my issue was most evident when pushing up. The effort is applied from below, where the connecting rods connect to each wing. The non-obvious lever in my ornithopter turned out to be a combination of two different classes of levers, a class 2 and 3 lever, both of which exist in each wing. Class 2 Lever The class 2 lever is the section from the fulcrum to where the effort is applied by the connecting rod connected to the wing. The load which makes it a class 2 lever is the air pressure on the section of wing extending back between those two points. This fits the definition of a class 2 lever because the load is in the middle, between the fulcrum and the effort. Class 3 Lever The class 3 lever is again formed by the fulcrum and the effort at the connecting rod, but the load is the air pressure on the wing on the side farther from the effort in the opposite direction of the fulcrum. This fits the definition of a class 3 lever because the effort is in the middle, between the load and the fulcrum. Seeing Levers Everywhere So while levers don’t always stand out, they are found in a large number of places. That’s doubtless due to how useful they are. We’d like to hear in the comments below where you’ve used levers or which surprising places you’ve found them in.","Levers are literally all around us.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. Airlines are getting much more parsimonious about upgrades. Where once it would happen almost automatically, now even miles and privileges won't necessarily get you very far. A British novelist, however, believes she has a secret. Which, now that she's revealed it, may not become much of a secret at all. Tilly Bagshawe told Bloomberg that there are two little words that can move the upgrade mountains. They are revenue management. This is the secret department of anti-senitmental actuaries who try to ensure that every seat is sold for the maximum price. Bagshawe, who says she flies a lot on Virgin Atlantic, insists that dropping these two words to a reservation agent on the phone will reveal whether or not there are First Class upgrades available for miles. She has a ready-made script if the reservation agent is being unforthcoming. ""When they say no, ask them to check or just be put through to revenue management so you can ask when they will release some, as well as how many seats are left,"" she said. She suggests absolute politeness. Surely you know this helps. With a reasonable tone, you can find out how many seats might still be available and when the revenue management department might be prepared to release its grip on them. ""We've had a pretty much 100 percent success rate,"" Bagshawe insisted. She must, though, have a huge heap of miles in order to achieve this startling success rate. I would caution, however, that this might work with some airlines and not with others. I suspect, too, that if everyone starts doing it, the airlines might see everyone coming. Personally, I often find that you either strike up a rapport with an airline employee or you don't. Some decide that they like you and want to help you. Just because. Others are sighing inside and wishing you'd just go away. Life is mercurial. Sometimes, you might get lucky. Often? Now that's pushing it.","Oh, but what if everyone starts doing this?",2018-02-22T19:24:31Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",The 2 Words That Will Get You an Upgrade to First Class (According to Someone Who Keeps Doing It),https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/the-2-words-that-will-get-you-an-upgrade-to-first-class-according-to-someone-who-keeps-doing-it.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_505890462_346504.jpg,,Inc.com,class-2,1
Jonathan Shieber,"Foot Locker, the mostly mall-bound retailer of mass market sneakers, has invested $100 million in the sneaker marketplace and retailer of primarily rare and exclusive high-end athletic and lifestyle shoes, GOAT Group.
The companies said that the investment would eventually lead to Foot Locker and Goat Group combining their efforts across their digital and physical retail platforms.
GOAT said in a statement that the company would use the investment to accelerate its global operations, expand its omnichannel experience and its technologies.
IT Manager Clint Arndt, CEO Eddy Lu
In an interview, GOAT co-founder and chief product officer declined to disclose the company’s valuation, its revenues, how sales break down across geographic regions, or how it will work with Foot Locker going forward.
In 2018 several top sellers on GOAT sold over $10 million worth of sneakers up from $2 million in 2017, according to the company. GOAT Group now counts over 600 employees, up from 200 a year ago, with 12 million users currently active on the platform. That figure is up massively from last year when 2.5 million folks were on the platform.
Over the same period GOAT boosted its sneaker listings to 750,000 from 200,000 and now has 150,000 vendors selling to over 12 million customers. With growth like that no wonder Foot Locker wants a sip of that GOAT stew.

In 2015, we pioneered the ship-to-verify model with a mission to bring a seamless and safe customer experience to the secondary sneaker market, said Eddy Lu, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of GOAT Group. With over 3,000 retail locations, Foot Locker will support our primarily digital presence with physical access points worldwide, bringing more value to our community of buyers and sellers. Having Foot Locker as a strategic partner will also expand our business as we continue to scale our operations both domestically and internationally.
Last year, GOAT raised $60 million as it announced its largest strategic move to date — acquiring the physical retailer Flight Club to begin pushing into real-world in-store experiences.
Scott Martin is joining the GOAT Group’s board of directors and extends Foot Locker’s investments in startup companies and brands, which already included the womens luxury activewear brand Carbon38; tactical play and childrens lifestyle brand Super Heroic; and footwear design academy PENSOLE.
GOAT has raised $197.6 million since it was launched it 2015. The company competes with other vendors like Stock X.

Devin Coldewey,"It’s finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy’s first mission, and SpaceX’s heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time. The launch will take a major communications satellite into orbit, and as an encore all three of the first stages will attempt to return to Earth and make soft landings. Success means the inauguration of a new era in spaceflight.
Falcon Heavy was first tested last February, with a dummy payload of a Tesla Roadster and a mannequin dubbed “Starman,” now somewhere past the orbit of Mars. Since then the rocket has gained a few improvements, including a reinforced center core that should help enable it to return safely.
In addition to taking an enormous satellite to orbit, SpaceX will be attempting to recover all three first stages and the fairing that covers the payload as well. The side stages will be guiding themselves to Landing Zone 1 and 2 nearby the launch complex, while the center core, having traveled much further, will land on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship Of Course I Still Love You. Other boats will attempt to catch both pieces of the falling fairing.
It bears mentioning here that not only are there essentially no launch vehicles in Falcon Heavy’s class, but certainly none that can autonomously return to Earth and be used again. SpaceX is very far out ahead of the competition here, though the next few years will see new entrants in the field. But this will be a first for several reasons.
The 230-foot assembly, all brand new rockets (rather than reused), is currently standing up at Launch Complex 39A, the site of many historic launches, from Apollo to Space Shuttle. T-0 is this evening at 6:35 local time in Cape Canaveral. You can watch it live below or at the SpaceX webcast site.
The important events we’ll be on the watch for will occur roughly as follows, in approximate minutes and seconds after takeoff:
1:09 after launch: Max-Q, the point at which the launch vehicle is under the most strain. As reliable as rockets have become, every launch is a white-knuckler until after this point.
2:30: BECO, or booster engine cutoff, when the side cores shut off and detach.
3:31: MECO, or main engine cutoff, when the central core shuts down and detaches from the second stage, which ignites a few seconds afterwards. The fairings will detach about 30 seconds later.
7:51: Side cores descend at LZ for landing.
8:48: Second stage first burn concludes and cruise phase begins.
9:48: Main core descends at drone ship for landing.
???: Fairing descends over ocean to be caught. Timing is unclear on this, but it probably will be a few minutes after the main core lands.
27:34: Second stage second burn begins, lasting 1:26.
34:02: Arabsat-6A detaches from launch vehicle and continues under its own power. At this point SpaceX will have completed its mission, though it will take some time for the satellite to arrive at its geosynchronous orbit.
We’ll be watching too, and will update this post with any relevant new info.","It's finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy's first mission, and SpaceX's heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time.

Heather Dockray,"Many comedians will attempt to do an impression of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but few will ever succeed. Thankfully, we finally found someone who has mastered the art. 
Comedian Alyssa Limperis recently posted her impression of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to YouTube and Twitter on Thursday. Limperis imagines how Ocasio-Cortez might respond to Tan France, the stylist from Queer Eye, and his infamous French tuck (France's preferred method of tucking shirts).
The cast of Queer Eye, sans Karamo Brown, recently visited Ocasio-Cortez and other Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill.
SEE ALSO: AOC invited Bobby from 'Queer Eye' to help decorate her office
The impression is terrifyingly spot-on. Limperis captures Ocasio-Cortez's emphatic way of announcing her syllables and characteristic hand movements. She knows exactly where she places her gaze and just how often she twists her neck in a mini-fit of irritation.
Kudos to Limperis for further addressing one of the show's greatest injustices the excessive amount of labor Bobby Berk performs compared to others on the show. 
People on Twitter felt similarly.
This is without uncertainty the only AOC impression History will remember

EMILY S. RUEB,"Although Mr. Beierle had searched online for pornographic yoga content as well as locations and schedules of yoga studios in Tallahassee, the department concluded that there was no evidence he had specifically targeted any individual.
But Mr. DeLeo said it was likely that Mr. Beierle targeted a familiar community in Tallahassee, where records show he had been arrested at least twice, including separate cases in 2012 and 2016 in which he was accused of groping a woman. Both of those cases were dismissed.
The department also obtained communications from 2013 between Mr. Beierle and a woman named Jennifer whom he had met online and who mentioned that she had attended a hot yoga class in Tallahassee. The relationship soured after Mr. Beierle sent her sexually suggestive messages, according to the police.
Chief DeLeo said Mr. Beierle suffered severe financial stress because he had been fired at least twice from substitute teaching jobs and sought mental health counseling on a number of occasions. Chief DeLeo said that records could not be released because of privacy laws.
Days before the shooting, Mr. Beierle purchased a yoga mat and ear plugs at a Walmart and checked into a hotel, according to the police. He canceled his psychiatry appointments with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
On Nov. 2, the day of the shooting, Mr. Beierle left two hotel keys in his room, a sign that he was not planning to return, Chief DeLeo said.
Then Mr. Beirele went to Hot Yoga Tallahassee, arriving at 5:29 p.m.

Alex Macheras 20-year-old Alex Macheras is a broadcast aviation analyst who flies around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even available to the public. He flew on the delivery flight for the Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft on December 13. Says Singapore Airlines' A380 first class suite is the ""hands down winner"" of all the competitors — including Emirates — for several reasons. Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. As a broadcast aviation analyst, he spends his time jet setting around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even open to the public. Last week he took an empty flight from the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France to Changi Airport in Singapore for the delivery of Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft, and shared his experience via his Instagram. Here he is being greeted by the cabin crew ahead of the 13-hour flight. Macheras told Business Insider that on these kinds of trips he spends the duration of the journey examining every aspect of the plane's cabins. ""I'm usually on my hands and knees in the suites testing out what it's like to work on the dining table, use the blinds, dim the lights, etc.,"" he said. His experience sounds similar to YouTube star Casey Neistat's when he took a trip in one of Emirates' newly-launched first class suites its Boeing 777 aircraft. After checking out all of the private cabin's features, Neistat called it the ""all-time greatest airplane seat."" However, Macheras, who has experienced the first class offerings from the likes of Emirates, Etihad, and Cathay Pacific, said there were a number of things about Singapore Airlines' new private suite that make it the ""hands down winner."" Here are the six reasons Singapore Airlines wins, according to Macheras. 1. The bed and seat are separate The core reason Singapore Airlines' A380 first class cabin is ""miles ahead of Emirates'"" is its concept, Macheras said. ""These days 99% of business class cabins feature a big seat that reclines into a fully flat bed — it's so common nowadays — but this suite has a seat and a bed,"" he explained. Alex Machers 2. It's more spacious than a 'central London apartment' The second reason is the space, he said. ""When we talk about spacious cabins in first class, it's usually about how much movement you have in your seat. ""With Emirates first class, it's a small area that is taken up pretty much by the seat, so you can just stand on the spot, but in the Singapore suite there was space to walk around. I'm known for my pacing on the phone — in fact I'm doing it right now — and I found myself pacing during the flight at 43,000 feet."" ""People have tweeted me saying it looks bigger than their central London apartment,"" he added. Alex Macheras 3. It has an understated, elegant style ""With all these airlines offering beds in their first class cabins, they have to differentiate themselves from competitors through the small details and quirks,"" Macheras said. ""Emirates is known for its glitziness and sparkly gold products, whereas Singapore is understated and elegant. It's low-lit like a boutique hotel, which appeals to many more people than the wild lights show of Emirates."" 4. The amenity kits are luxurious Luxury French brand Lalique has designed the new amenity kits as well as the pajamas and bedding for the first class suites. ""The new amenity kits were another thing that impressed me,"" Macheras said. ""But this isn’t just a plush blanket, it’s white crisp Lalique bedsheets that you might expect in a hotel room. The amenity kits are packed with Lalique fragrances, creams, balms, moisturisers, and even a scented candle. 5. The seat has a 'swivel' mechanism so you can face the window Alex Macheras The plush armchair featured in the Singapore Airlines' suite has an electronic swivel mechanism that means you can face any direction you want. ""What's the bonus in having this function? It's something I hadn't considered before I took this flight, but when you fly as much as I do, you've often seen all of the movies on offer,"" he said. Being able to reposition your seat means that you can soak up the views while aboard, he explained. ""When we flew over the Middle East it was 6 p.m. on the ground and the sun was setting and I caught this impressive sunset with so many different tones of orange,"" he said. ""I could just relax and watch it with my headphones in, without getting neck ache."" It also just so happened to be the peak of the Geminid meteor shower while he was on the flight, so while flying over Iran the aircraft was surrounded by shooting stars. ""In the space of about four minutes, I saw about 10 shooting stars,"" he said. 6. There's a 32-inch flat screen TV ""Finally, there's a 32-inch flat screen mounted on the wall of the suite, which is controlled by the tablet and can move left or right — it's like being in someone's living room.""

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","By Ray Sanchez, CNN Updated 11:30 AM ET, Sun February 18, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. This account of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is based on official statements, interviews with survivors, their relatives and law enforcement officials, as well as other CNN reporting. (CNN) -- On Valentine's Day morning, Nikolas Cruz's 5-foot-7-inch, 120-pound frame couldn't be shaken from his bed in suburban Parkland, Florida. Cruz, 19, lived on a lush street dotted with tropical plants with a family who had opened their home to him after the death of his adoptive parents. The father, James Snead, normally delivered Cruz to his adult GED class on the way to work. Wednesday was different. ""I don't go to school on Valentine's Day,"" the freckle-faced Cruz insisted. At his former high school five miles away, a new day was beginning. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's free breakfast was winding down. The 7:40 a.m. bell signaling the start of first period loomed. The ""daily morning affirmation"" that day on the public school's website came from the late self-help author Louise Hay: ""Life supports me in every way possible."" Lori Alhadeff dropped off her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, at the sprawling campus, home to more than 3,000 students. ""I love you,"" she told Alyssa. That day, teachers collected applications for the National English Honor Society. Members of the tennis teams raised money with the sale of hoodies, yoga pants and other items. Classmates exchanged Valentine's Day carnations sold for $1 in a cafeteria. At lunchtime, some students left $60 deposits for graduation rings. The school day went on as normal. But before the last bell of the day could ring, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School -- whose motto tells students to ""be positive, be passionate"" -- would be the scene of one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. It was no secret to those that knew him that Cruz was fascinated with guns and violence. He posed with guns and knives on Instagram, showed guns to a former classmate and kept a semiautomatic rifle in a lockbox in his room. A former classmate said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a ""school shooter."" The orphaned youth also battled mental illness and depression, his attorneys said later, exacerbated by the recent death of his adoptive mother. She had repeatedly called police to the home to help deal with his violent outbursts. A defense attorney called him ""a broken child."" Cruz eventually made it out of bed that Valentine's Day. He exchanged a number of unremarkable text messages with the son of the family he stayed with and called an Uber. At 2:19 p.m., a gold-colored Uber vehicle dropped him off at the school he once attended. A school employee recognized him. Cruz had been expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons. Now he was back, with a.223-caliber AR-15 rifle concealed in a soft black case. The employee alerted a colleague that the former student was ""walking purposefully"" toward a school building. The school, like many across the US, had made active shooter training drills its protocol. Cruz entered the school building at the east stairwell. He pulled the rifle out of its bag. At some point, Cruz activated a fire alarm. Nicole Baltzer, 18, was in trigonometry class. In 10 minutes, the school day would be over. Why was the fire alarm blaring again? There had been a fire drill earlier in the day. This second one sowed confusion, and students began to scurry from classrooms. Cruz began the massacre, initially targeting people on the first floor. Bursts of semiautomatic fire echoed in the corridors. ""So many shots,"" Baltzer said. ""They were very close."" Freshman Kelsey Friend and her classmates in geography class rushed back into their classroom once they heard the shots. Her teacher, Scott Beigel, 35, unlocked the door for them. There he stood, like a sentry, ushering his students to safety. She thought Beigel would follow her inside. He didn't. The sound of gunfire grew louder. Friend wanted to believe this was just another drill. A more realistic one maybe, with police officers shooting blanks. Other students thought firecrackers were causing the staccato bursts. Then Friend realized this was no drill. Beigel's body crumpled to the floor at the classroom door. Later she would say, ""I am alive today because of him."" The first 911 call came at 2:23 p.m. The shooter's identity was already known. ""I'm being told, advised by the employees, that it should be a student,"" an officer at the school radioed to dispatch. ""Nikolas Cruz, Nikolas Cruz, who came in on campus with a backpack."" Another transmission provided more information: ""I'm being advised by ROTC students that he was kicked out last year. We're still looking for a photo -- he worked at a Dollar Store on Magnolia. Last name spelling is C-R-U-Z."" 'I'm in a school shooting right now' Terrified, the students turned to the familiar: cell phone cameras, text messages, Snapchat and Twitter. They gave the world a glimpse into their horror as it unfolded. Trembling hands. Blood-curdling screams. Bullet-strewn classrooms. Blood-stained floors. Bodies. ""I'm in a school shooting right now."" He hunkered down under a desk in a dark classroom. The shooter stalked the corridors outside. Minutes later, Aidan tweeted again. ""My school is being shot up and I am locked inside. I'm f***ing scared right now."" The tweet included photos of students huddled on the floor. They checked their phones between desks. One appeared to be texting. In 17-year-old Hannah Carbocci's Holocaust history class, a bullet pierced the wall. She thought of her big sister, her protector. Pop-pop! Pop-pop! Screams. More gunshots. Hannah, under a teacher's desk, texted her 19-year-old sister Kaitlin. kaitlin there is a shooter on campus kaitlin i am not joking they just shot through the walls someone in my class is injured 'The Kevlar would slow the bullet down' Assistant coach and security guard Aaron Feis, a graduate of the School, put himself between three students and the shooter, an act of bravery that surprised no one. Feis was shot. He died after he was rushed into surgery. Colton Haab, a 17-year-old junior and football player, would say later, ""That's Coach Feis. He wants to make sure everybody is safe before himself."" As the shots rang out, Haab ushered 60 to 70 people to shelter in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps room. They shielded themselves behind sheets of Kevlar used for Junior ROTC marksmanship practice. ""The Kevlar would slow the bullet down,"" Haab thought. Teacher Melissa Falkowski hid in a large closet with nearly 20 students. She brought them in from the hallway. Some were crying. Other were calling or texting family with words of gratitude and love. Cruz wasn't done. He roamed the first-floor halls before going to the second floor. He shot a victim in another room. On the third floor, he dropped his rifle and bag. He then ran out of the building, blending in with students and staff who were pouring out of the school, many with their hands in the air. Responding officers suspected as much. ""Someone checking the IDs of those kids before they get up and leave the area?"" an officer radioed to dispatch. Later came another transmission: ""Attention all units, be advised -- a repeat of the last instruction -- juveniles being loaded onto the buses are going to park. The IDs need to be checked of the juveniles before they get on the buses. Make sure that Nikolas Cruz isn't part of this group."" 'I knew at that point she was gone' But Cruz slipped away. He bought a drink at a Subway sandwich shop inside a nearby Walmart. Later, he sat at a McDonald's for a few minutes. Police helicopters buzzed overhead. Tearful students reunited outside the school with their parents. Lori Alhadeff, hours after dropping off her daughter Alyssa, raced back to the school when she learned of the shooting. ""I knew at that point she was gone,"" she said. ""I felt it in my heart."" Alyssa didn't make it. Other students remained on lockdown. Not taking chances, some called 911 before letting SWAT teams members enter. ""Student in Classroom 1255 says somebody's pushing on her door -- is that a police officer? Any units pushing on 1255?"" a police dispatcher asked. ""Yes, yes, 1255, that's going to be us,"" an officer responded. ""You want them to open it or do you want me to tell them to stand down?"" ""Tell her to open her door, have her open her door right now!"" As student Masiel Baluja evacuated, she put her book bag on her back just in case she got shot from behind. She ran toward students and teachers. She jumped a fence before police escorted her to a group of students assembled near Walmart. She could see her mother, but Masiel was suspicious of those around her. ""I didn't know if any of them were shooters or not,"" Masiel said later, fighting back tears. ""I felt very uncomfortable because anybody can be a shooter."" 'He looked like a typical high school student' A police officer made contact with Snead, the father who had taken in Cruz after the teen's mother died last fall. Snead said he had spoken with Cruz, who told him he was at the McDonald's near campus. Nearly 80 minutes after the first 911 call, a police officer from nearby Coconut Creek spotted a young man walking along the side of a residential street. The description and clothing matched the shooter's. ""He looked like a typical high school student,"" officer Michael Leonard said. ""For a quick moment I thought, 'Could this be the person? Is this who I need to stop?'"" Leonard pulled over and Cruz, wearing a maroon polo shirt with the school's eagle mascot on the sleeve, surrendered without incident. ""We have the suspect detained,"" came the radio call at 3:41 p.m. The suspect in the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook was caught and 17 people were dead.",It felt like a normal Valentine's Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","In Celebrity Recipes, we tackle a favorite recipe from a beloved star, past or present. Celebrities! They’re just better than regular people. Not only do they have the life we all dream of, sometimes they take that downtime between movie shoots or recording sessions to become great at something else we plebes long to master. Like cooking! Honestly inspired by the revelation that Vincent Price once cooked a fish in a dishwasher many moons ago, we decided it would be fun to dive into some legendary recipes by famous types. It’s been said before that just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you necessarily should… Read more Read Price was a bit of a gourmet, after all, and had his own cookbook, where he favored different types of pie. Writer/director Nora Ephron included loads of recipes in her first novel, Heartburn (which was about her divorce from Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein), including at least three different potato dishes. Keith Richards apparently included a bangers-and-mash recipe in his autobiography, and we’ll be sure to feature the famous Elvis fried banana and peanut butter sandwich. Hey, even original One Day At A Time star and Van Halen ex Valerie Bertinelli has a cooking show nowadays. (And if you have any celeb recipes you’d like to see us cover, please feel free to suggest them in the comments!) To kick things off, we decided to go with the greatest celebrity recipe of them all: Katharine Hepburn’s brownies. This recipe was first published in The New York Times after Hepburn’s death in 2003, and has a pretty terrific story behind it. Turns out writer Heather Henderson’s father lived in the same new York neighborhood as Miss Hepburn. When Heather wanted to drop out of Bryn Mawr, her father got his famous neighbor and fellow Bryn Mawr alumna to talk her out of it, and they became if not friends, then friendly acquaintances. When Miss Hepburn suffered a fall, Mr. Henderson brought her some brownies. His charity was immediately greeted with a critique that his brownies were too floury by the famously brusque and candid star, who quickly rattled off her own brownie recipe, repeated below. We can only imagine that a force of nature like Katharine Hepburn—fond of brisk, miles-long walks in the woods, never slowing down for an instant—did not have a ton of time to mess around in the kitchen. Subsequently, her brownies are simple, no-nonsense, and can be thrown together in about 15 minutes. But like her, simple does not mean plain here, but classic: The immediacy and brevity of these brownies does nothing to deter how wonderful they are. The melting of the butter means they couldn’t be easier to stir together, and the minimal flour does indeed result in brownies that are exceptionally chewy and moist, almost fudgy. They’re a little hard to handle, but delicious—just like Kate The Great herself. We don’t favor walnuts, which Hepburn probably harvested herself from her own New England farmland, but threw in some mini-chocolate chips instead. We might be tempted to add some heavy-duty cinnamon if we weren’t afraid that she would come back from the grave and haunt us for messing with her famous recipe. Since the ingrates we live with are going to demolish anything chocolate-related, we took Miss Hepburn’s brownies to the Onion staff for a more discerning opinion. They were as big a hit at the office as they were as home. Our colleagues agreed that the brownies tasted fudgy, “velvety,” “torte-like,” “like a cross between fudge and a brownie”; one taster rightfully called them “medium rare.” Another enthused over that softness of the brownie, as “most are over-baked”; this one “tastes the way a brownie should,” a “grown-up brownie” (that our kids loved anyway). Likely the most inspired comment came from the taster who surmised that the recipe was obviously from “someone with class.” We couldn’t agree more. 1/2 cup cocoa 1 stick butter 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup flour 1 cup broken-up walnuts or pecans (and/or chocolate chips) 1 teaspoon vanilla pinch of salt Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Melt butter in saucepan with cocoa and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Mix in eggs, one at a time. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, flour, nuts, vanilla and salt, and add to the egg/chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased 8""x8"" square pan. Bake about 35 minutes, being careful not to overbake; they should be gooey. Let cool and cut into bars. This is a small batch, makes about 12.","In Celebrity Recipes, we tackle a favorite recipe from a beloved star, past or present.

"kcorcoran@businessinsider.com (Kieran Corcoran), Kieran Corcoran","The Radcliffe Camera, part of Oxford University's campus. Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui, 39, said that his failure to get a first-class Oxford degree held him back. He attempted to sue the university for damages over his missed career opportunities. The judge said his lacklustre career was his own fault, and suggested that he ""lower his expectations."" An Oxford graduate, who tried to sue the university for £1 million ($1.4 million) because it gave him a lower degree result than he thinks he deserves, has had his case thrown out of court. Faiz Siddiqui, 39, missed his goal of getting a first-class degree after studying law at Brasenose College in 2000. He said he missed out on a glittering and lucrative career as a result, and tried to take Oxford to court, claiming that it was their poor teaching which denied him the qualification he allegedly deserved. But, despite the case reaching the High Court in London, the judge threw out the case on Wednesday, according to legal documents reviewed by Business Insider. Mr Justice Foksett said Siddiqui had failed to prove his case, and was essentially responsible for his own poor academic performance. News outlets including The Times newspaper pictured Siddiqui at a hearing earlier in the trial: Siddiqui was offered a training contract with law firm Clifford Chance after graduating and worked for a string of other law firms. He also had a spell at Ernst and Young, though he was later dismissed and is now unemployed. It fell far short of the career he desired: Siddiqui wanted a post-graduate qualification from Harvard, and envisioned making large sums of money from subsequent employment. Earlier in the trial, Siddiqui's lawyer described his client's 2:1 grade (an ""upper second-class"" degree, one below first-class) as an ""inexplicable failure"" which was cited as a reason he failed to get accepted as prestigious schools. However, the judge ruled that there were other factors at play. Oxford admitted that there were some flaws in its teaching during the time Siddiqui was a student, but argued that it wasn't reasonable to conclude that these faults were legally responsible for a students' lacklustre career 17 years later. Foksett agreed. In the conclusion to his judgment, he noted that Siddiqui has ""a firmly entrenched belief that all his post-Oxford problems lie with what occurred there. I have been unable to accept that this is so."" He suggested instead that he ""lower his expectations at least for the time being and start using his undoubted intelligence to create a worthwhile future for himself.""","Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui, 39, said that his failure to get a first-class Oxford degree held him back.

Ben Lovejoy,"The Next Web has an interesting piece talking about what Jeff Powers refers to as ‘Class 2 smarthomes.’ With today’s tech – Class 1 – we do have things liked timed automations, but a lot of the time we’re controlling things manually. Class 2 smarthomes would, he argues, be truly smart, and figure out a lot more things on their own. Some of what he proposes would be pretty complex, but there’s one idea in there which Apple could fairly easily implement, and which would make HomeKit a lot friendlier for non-techies … One of the difficulties with HomeKit generally is that it doesn’t always scale well. When you have one smart light per room, or a set you always want to control in tandem, then it’s easy. Turn on the living room lights But as you add more devices, things get messier. For example, we have a combined living-room and dining room. If we want ambient lighting, we use the ‘living room lamps’ – which are floor lamps. If we want more light, we will also put on ‘living room yellow lamp’ and ‘living room side lamp.’ If we want task lighting, we’ll use the overhead lights which, for simplicity, we’ve called ‘dining room lights.’ Even for me – the guy who named them – I sometimes have to think for a second before I voice the request to Siri. My partner took longer to get comfortable with the idea that you sometimes have to be very specific about light names. And for guests, well, basically forget it. They rely on wall-mounted Wi-Fi switches or the Home app. What Powers references is the grandmother test. Imagine this home is set up for your grandparents. Grandma won’t need to memorize the den lights’ name. Rather, she can say “Turn on the lights.” In theory, Siri does this to some extent. Because HomePods know the room to which they’ve been assigned, you can simply say ‘turn on the lights’ and – in theory – it will do so for that room. Though you’ll always get all of them, and in practice it doesn’t always work reliably. Our bedroom HomePod, just told to switch on the lights, switched on every light in the apartment … What I’d like to see is HomeKit able to work with iBeacons. Dot these around the house, and then when you tell Siri to turn on a light or turn off a fan, it will be able to work out exactly where you are and respond accordingly. For example, if I’m sat in an armchair on the right side of the living room and ask Siri to ‘turn on the lamp,’ it should turn on the one nearest to me. If we’re sat at the dining room table and tell it to ‘turn on the light,’ it should switch on the overhead light above the table. The obvious next step is to track the locations of family members as they – or at least, their watches and phones – move around the home. When it sees that all devices have left a room, it should switch off lights and fans automatically, restoring the exact mix of lights when someone returns. AirPlay 2 could also interface with iBeacons. For example, if two of you are in the bedroom listening to music in the morning and one of you walks through to the kitchen, it could add the kitchen HomePod, so that the music is playing on both. When the second person joins you, it could switch off music to the bedroom HomePod. It’s not difficult to think of a whole bunch of ways that this kind of location-tracking within the home could make smart homes a great deal smarter than they are today. Albeit only if everyone is wearing an Apple Watch or takes their phone with them as they move around the home. What’s your view? Useful or not?

Jamie Rigg,"Sony is currently able to claim bragging rights on a few shooting modes you don't get elsewhere. They might be special from a technical perspective, but they're not relevant to the end user. One of these is 1080p super-slow-mo video. Last year, Sony's XZ Premium introduced us to 960 fps clips shot at 720p, though you can only capture them in 0.2-second bursts. But Samsung's Galaxy S9 and Huawei's P20 Pro can do that now too, so Sony's upped the resolution stakes. The trade-off at 1080p is that the slow-mo window has been halved to 0.1 seconds. Don't get me wrong, the feature is cool, but you have to predict what you want to shoot before it happens or you'll miss it -- a bird taking flight, for example. Timing it correctly is like winning the lottery. You can play as much as you want, but you're unlikely to be successful. Shooting at 1080p instead of 720p is like halving your odds, which are already slim. The second unique feature is being able to record 4K HDR video. Again, it sounds cool, but remember you need an HDR TV or monitor to play your movies to get the full benefit. And I can't see any benefit to HDR in this scenario. On the XZ2, the clips I captured were horribly overexposed. These were shot on a sunny day, which is important. Filming the same landscape on an overcast day on the XZ2 Compact resulted in the opposite: dark, underexposed clips. The feature seems to take the dominant characteristic of the scene, light or shadow, and accentuate it massively. Regular 4K clips are much prettier and reliably lit, making the HDR toggle something to avoid. The front-facer is a serviceable, if slightly underwhelming 5-megapixel camera. It depends on how often you imagine using it as to whether this is important or not, as you might understandably expect more from what's effectively a brand-new flagship. It does work with Sony's 3D creator app, though, if you're into rudimentary 3D scans of your face. Performance and battery life User experience is where the XZ2 Compact shines. It has all the top-tier guts of the XZ2 -- including, most importantly, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 chip. It's the Rolls Royce of smartphone processors. Whatever games you prefer, they'll play at the highest graphics settings without skipping a beat. Apps, meanwhile, load up straight away and run smoothly. It's what you wish every phone you'd had before it was like. I found the XZ1 Compact to be frustrating to use, with apps constantly crashing, weird hangs and such. This new little powerhouse is very much a return to form. Perhaps Android 8.0 Oreo has something to do with that, though Sony's slapped its Xperia skin with extra visual customization features on top. But other than a bit of bloatware and a couple of duplicative apps, it's not far off the stock experience. The Compact's battery is a bit smaller than the XZ2's. There's only so much space in that little frame, you see. It still has to power just as many pixels, though, so you'd think battery life might be different across devices, but it's not. In fact, I found that the Compact went a little bit further, draining slightly less charge per round of PUBG Mobile, YouTube session, etc. The contrast isn't stark, and if you're constantly on your phone you'll have to plug it in before the day's out. In other words, battery life is nothing special but also fairly typical. The competition There are two ways you can look at the XZ2 Compact: either as a flagship or as a rare breed of small smartphone. If you think of it as the former, then its main rivals are its bigger brother, the XZ2, and Samsung's Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. I say that because these are the only phones on the market with a Snapdragon 845 chip at the moment. I wouldn't spend my money on anything less at this stage, being seriously impressed with the power of Qualcomm's latest processor. The XZ2 Compact launches in the UK on April 6th for £549, and unfortunately we're still in the dark as to US pricing and availability. I'd guess it will retail for around $650 when it eventually arrives stateside, making it significantly cheaper than its rivals. The XZ2 costs £699 in the UK, so it's a pretty significant savings you're making it you go down the Compact route. The gulf is even wider between the Compact and Samsung's newest phones, which start at £739. If price is important, then the Compact wins out. If size is important, the Compact also wins out. The whole point of the Compact is to serve the underserved. There isn't anything quite like it. The iPhone SE is small, but that hasn't been updated in two years. The Nokia 1 and 2 are small, but they are affordable entry-level devices with spec sheets the Compact laughs at. The iPhone 8 and Pixel 2 are both 5-inch devices, so they're in the mix. The displays on these phones are of the 16:9 variety, though, so both are much bigger than the XZ2 Compact, not to mention offer lower resolutions at substantially higher prices. Wrap-up Sony's Xperia XZ2 Compact is in a class of its own, packing every meaningful feature and component of the XZ2 into a petite, translucent body. I'd even say the device's 5-inch full HD+ display is better than the 5.7-inch equivalent on the XZ2. What's more, the Compact is reasonably priced, which is unusual for Sony. Anyone generally in the market for a new flagship should put it on their short list, and lovers of small but high-performance machines should think about taking the plunge. It's the Compact you've been wanting.","<!-- TAG START { player: ""Eng: Sideview, autoplay, muted"", owner: ""Engadget AOL"", for: ""Engadget AOL"" } --> <!-- TAG END { date: 04/06/18 } --> Smaller smartphones have fallen out of fashion.

David Slotnick,"A new Italian airline launched its first long-haul route on Friday, with its maiden flight from New York's JFK airport to Milan's Malpensa airport. As Air Italy's Airbus A330 received the traditional ""water cannon salute"" upon landing at JFK, the airline's stakeholders and leadership celebrated the beginning of what many hope will be a swift and effective expansion of routes throughout the world. The flight represents a major milestone for the airline, which aims to grow from a small niche carrier to major international airline over the next several years, starting with six long-haul routes in 2018. The airline has more than 50 aircraft on order. Air Italy is actually a rebranding of legacy Italian regional carrier Meridiana, which was itself the product of mergers with several other small Italian carriers. While the airline had flown successfully, promoting its brand and launching new routes as recently as 2014, the airline faced financial difficulties. In late-2017, Qatar Airways — the top-ranked airline in the world in 2017— announced that it was acquiring a 49% stake in Meridiana, which it planned to overhaul and rebrand as Air Italy. The other 51% is held by the previous sole shareholder Alisarda, which is in turn owned by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, as reported by aviation news website The Points Guy. The two companies — Qatar Airways and Alisarda — have formed a new holding company for Air Italy, AQA. Marco Rigotti, Air Italy's Executive Deputy Chairman, before the inaugural flight from JFK to Milan. David Slotnick/Business Insider According to Marco Rigotti, Air Italy's Executive Deputy Chairman, the airline is poised to grow quickly. It recently took possession of the first of 20 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft for intra-Italy flights from the Milan hub, and has 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order — the first will be delivered in Spring 2019 — to operate its long-haul network. Until the Dreamliners are ready, Air Italy is flying Airbus A330 aircraft from Qatar for its long-haul flights. In addition to the Milan-JFK route, Air Italy is launching a nonstop flight between Milan and Miami on June 8th. Flights to Bangkok and Mumbai will launch this fall, and two more long-haul destinations will launch in 2018 — these have not yet been announced. Air Italy's launch and ownership by Qatar represents a unique opportunity. Current Italian flagship carrier Alitalia has been in financial straits for several years and is currently in bankruptcy, despite a 2014 move by Qatar competitor Etihad Airways to invest in the airline. As Alitalia continues to struggle, Qatar Airways and Air Italy's leadership see an opportunity to rise as a new Italian long-haul standard bearer. David Slotnick/Business Insider In an interview with Business Insider and several other outlets, Rigotti said that the investment by Qatar provides Air Italy the framework, inspiration, and impetus to build the new airline around service, style, and passenger experience. ""Without [Qatar Airways and their chief executive Akbar Al Baker], this project would not exist,"" he said. ""Not in just in terms of the financial aspects; they have been fundamental inspiration in terms of how to create a high-quality product."" The onboard experience Air Italy's long-haul economy class seats will all be equipped with personal in-flight entertainment screens, at a time when airlines have been eliminating those monitors in favor of a ""bring your own device"" system, sometimes with streaming available from an onboard entertainment server. Flights will be equipped with Wi-Fi, and all passengers will have access to live satellite TV — including matches during the World Cup this summer. Economy seats, which are laid out in a 2-4-2 configuration, have 31"" of pitch — comparable to most full-service long-haul carriers — and are equipped with USB charging ports. Economy class meal service, meanwhile, will feature Italian wines and dishes, with meals like gnocchi and lasagna, and snacks including pizza and focaccia with aubergines. Air Italy Business class cabins feature lie-flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. With 78"" of pitch, they can be turned into beds for overnight flights. All business class passengers get amenity kits stocked with comfort products for the flight, as well as a turn-down service with mattress pads for ""bed mode,"" as well as a more robust catering service throughout the flight. A hub in Milan Air Italy's launch and use of Milan as its hub provides an opportunity to draw tourism and business traffic to the city and northern Italy. And it also serves international business travelers traveling anywhere in the country. ""We chose Milan for a couple of reasons,"" said Rigotti. ""Notably, Alitalia used it as a hub until several years ago, but the airline abandoned it due to financial difficulties. We see the city as an opportunity."" ""More then that, we're creating a hub from today because we are feeding connections on to Rome, Naples, and Palermo, and more. The passengers on the first flight are not just heading to Milan — they're going on to other destinations."" The two goals — building a new, customer-centric, service-focused airline, and building Milan as a hub for the entire country, go hand-in-hand, according to Rigotti. ""These goals are coherent with what Milan represents in Italy,"" he said. ""Milan is truly the most modern, contemporary town in Italy between fashion, its financial district, its activity, and its design. We have the same values, and that's how we'll operate."" Air Italy Deputy Executive Chariman Marco Rigotti (right) and Port Authority of NY and NJ official John Selden, cut the ribbon before Air Italy's first flight from JFK airport. David Slotnick/Business Insider While early reception has been positive — reporters from Airways Magazine on board the first flight from JFK gave the airline's business class a rave review — one thing is clear for travelers: competition for the Milanese and Italian markets seems to be a good thing. As of publication, flight searches found that Air Italy currently offers the least-expensive service to Milan and Rome for this summer and fall.","A new airline — Air Italy — made its maiden voyage on Friday between its hub in Milan and New York's JFK airport.

Steve Dent,"Fujifilm X-H1 Fujifilm's $1,900 X-H1, announced just last month, is a big leap over the X-T2, especially when it comes to video. It's Fujifilm's first camera with 5-axis in-body stabilization and can shoot photos at 14fps and handle true DCI 4K video (4,096 x 2,160). It has a brand-new, class-leading 3.69-million-dot EVF, excellent handling, thanks to dual dials and a chunky new grip, and a ""near-silent"" shutter mode. As for drawbacks, it lacks the 10-bit, 4:2:2 video of the like-priced GH5, and is a lot heavier than Sony's A6500. If that's too much : For a bit less, the $1,600, 24.3-megapixel X-T2 is essentially the predecessor to the X-H1 and offers similar performance and excellent handling, but no image stabilization. Panasonic GH5 I liked the $2,500 GH5s a lot, but as a video-specific camera, it's hard to recommend it to photographers. The $2,000 GH5, however, does both things well for less money. You can shoot DCI 4K video (and even 6K anamorphic) with 10 bits (billions) of colors and a 4:2:2 gamut, the best specs for a consumer camera. And with a 20.1-megapixel sensor and 12fps shooting speed, it won't limit photographers, either. As for shortcomings, the GH5 has mediocre contrast-detection autofocus and a smallish Micro Four Thirds sensor. If that's too much : The $1,700, 20.3-megapixel G9 is now Panasonic's flagship photography camera, offering 20fps shooting with continuous autofocus, 5-axis stabilization and, of course, 4K video -- without the GH5's 10-bit color and HDR. DSLRs Nikon D850 The $3,300 D850 is Nikon's first full-frame 4K camera, but it was worth the wait. With a 45.7-megapixel sensor, it's among the highest-resolution DSLRs on the market, bested only by Canon's 50.6-megapixel, $3,500 5Ds models. That gives the D850 unsurpassed image quality, but you still get decent speed (7fps burst shooting) and an excellent phase-detect autofocus system. The main negatives of the D850 are mediocre 4K video quality, slow and indecisive contrast-detect autofocus in live and video mode and autofocus tracking that's a step below Nikon's (excellent) D5. If that's too much : Consider Nikon's D7500. For just $1,200, you get excellent image quality from the 20.6-megapixel, DX (APS-C) sensor, decent 8fps shooting speeds and 4K video (with a 1.5X crop of the already-cropped DX sensor). If you don't mind an older camera, Nikon's $1,800 D750 offers a full-frame sensor, fast shooting speeds and great autofocus for nearly half the price of the D850. Canon 5D Mark IV Having arrived in 2016, Canon's 5D Mark IV is due for a refresh, but it's still one of the top enthusiast DSLRs on the market. The 30.4-megapixel full-frame sensor with dual-pixel autofocus provides excellent quality for professional portrait or landscape work, and it performs well even at high ISOs. For video, you get 4K with autofocus tracking that's widely considered the best in the business. A big downside for video, however, is the 1.64x crop factor in 4K and lack of a flippable screen for vlogging. If that's too much : Canon's $1,200 80D offers excellent Dual Pixel autofocus for video and live view, 7fps shooting speeds and, for video shooters, microphone and headphone ports. Sony Alpha A99 II Yes, Sony does make a DSLR, albeit one with an SLT translucence mirror that doesn't flip out of the way when you shoot, as on Nikon or Canon DSLRs. The $3,200 A99 II 's hybrid-like nature gives it some incredible specs, like a 12 fps shooting speed with eye tracking -- not bad for a camera with 42.2 megapixels of resolution. You also get 5-axis image stabilization, DSLR-like handling and excellent-quality 4K video. On the downside, the autofocus system, especially the subject tracking, doesn't work so well for video, and because of the SLT mirror, the A99 II doesn't perform as well in low light as the A7R II and III models. If that's too much : Take a look at Sony's aging $1,200 A77 II APS-C SLT camera. It offers equally quick 12fps shooting speeds with 24.3 megapixels of resolution, in-body stabilization and an effective autofocus system. Compact cameras Fujifilm X-100F Fujifilm's compact, fixed-lens cameras have been popular since the original Finepix X100 launched nearly seven years ago. The latest model, the $1,300 X-100F, has refined the formula to a T. You get a 24.3-megapixel X-Trans CMOS III sensor (with no low-pass filter), an f/2.0 35mm (full-frame equivalent) lens, more ergonomic button layout and gorgeous looks. All of that comes in a pocketable size, making it an ideal street-photography or vacation camera. There's no 4K video, but it can handle 1080p 60fps shooting, and video is not really the point anyway. Sony RX10 Mark IV The 20.1-megapixel RX10 Mark IV with a Type 1 (1-inch) sensor is not pocketable and, at $1,700, ain't cheap either. But it's incredibly fast and versatile for a compact superzoom, with a 24–600mm (full-frame equivalent) f/2.4–f/4 lens and unbelievable 24fps RAW shooting speed. Naturally, it shoots 4K and slow-motion video at up to 960fps (912 x 308). If you can handle its large form factor and price, you'll be able to shoot both landscapes and the look on your kids' faces when they score a goal -- even if you're in the nosebleed section. Sony RX1R II For $3,200, the Sony RX1R II is clearly not for everyone. But it's the only compact camera on the market with a full-frame sensor (other than the 24-megapixel, $4,000 Leica Q), and it packs an incredible 42.4 megapixels of resolution. With a 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens, retractable 2.4-million-dot OLED viewfinder and 102,400 max ISO, this is aimed at street photographers. As such, unlike with other Sony compacts, you don't get 4K video, and will have to settle for 1080p at 60fps. Wrap-up Enthusiast cameras do offer it all, but in different doses, depending on what you want. More so than any category, pure photographers might want to focus on DSLRs, while videographers will probably run toward mirrorless cameras.

Kieran Corcoran,"All Souls College at Oxford University. Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui got a 2:1 from Oxford in 2000, which he claims is too low. Siddiqui said the grade amounts to a failure and harmed his career. He is suing Oxford in the High Court for £1 million in damages. A lawyer who says his career failed to live up to his full potential is suing Oxford University for not giving him a good enough grade. Faiz Siddiqui, a 39-year-old graduate of Brasenose College, Oxford, is currently fighting the university in Britain's High Court, where he hopes to extract £1 million ($1.32 million) in damages. According to The Times newspaper, Siddiqui's lawyer described his client's 2:1 grade (an ""upper second-class"" degree, one below a first-class) as an ""inexplicable failure"" which scuppered his career. At the opening of the trial, he claimed that inadequate teaching, and the university's failure to adjust for his poor health during exam season, led to him missing the first-class degree he would otherwise have achieved. The court reportedly heard that Siddiqui was offered a training contract with Clifford Chance, one of the top London law firms, after he graduated. He then worked for three other law firms, and later for EY, before being dismissed ""essentially for poor performance"" in 2011, since which time he has been unemployed. Siddiqui's lawyer reportedly said this fell significantly short of the career his client had hoped for: A postgrad degree from an Ivy League university followed by a high-flying legal career either in the UK or US. A lawyer for Oxford dismissed Siddiqui's alternative career trajectory as ""fanciful,"" The Times said, and maintains that he, not the university, was responsible for his lacklustre career. The university asked last year for his case to be struck down, but a judge ruled that a trial should take place. It is not clear how Siddiqui funded his degree, but standard undergraduate tuition in England when he was studying cost £1,000 a year, less than one ninth of current levels.","Faiz Siddiqui got a 2:1 from Oxford in 2000, which he claims is too low.

Cherlynn Low,"But there are a few key differences. The Versa doesn't have GPS built in -- you'll have to use your phone if you want to track your running route. Also, in the US, the basic version of the Versa is missing NFC for Fitbit Pay. You'll have to shell out an extra $30 for the special edition to get that function. These are the tradeoffs you'll have to accept for the $100 drop in price. If you think you'll want to run outside without bringing your phone, you should probably pick the Ionic. In use As for the Versa's actual performance -- again, there are no surprises here. The watch does a good job of noticing when I've started any activity, as long as I've been at it for about 10 minutes. I wore it to a boxing class, and the Versa accurately recognized, thanks to my elevated heart rate, that I worked out for about 45 minutes. If I wanted to capture more information from that session, like calories burned and cardio performance, I could also launch Workout mode from the watch's Exercise app. Otherwise, it just logs those 45 minutes as ""active time."" When I went out for a run, it took the Versa about 10 seconds to connect to my phone so I could use the GPS. On the Ionic, you won't have to wait as long before you can start running, but it still needs a moment to find your location. One of the main differences between the Versa and the Ionic is the updated operating system. The Versa will ship with Fitbit OS 2.0, which the Ionic will get later this year. The new software places a dashboard under the Home screen, so you can see your day's stats just by swiping up. To do that on the Ionic you had to swipe to the left to pull up your apps, then launch the Today app. OS 2.0 just reduces the steps to one. This actually encouraged me to check my daily progress more often, and motivated me to stay on target. Notifications also got an overhaul. You can swipe down from the home screen or long press the top right physical button to pull down a list of your notifications. When an alert comes in, it peeks down from the top, and you can flick it away. But if you're paired to an Android, you'll be able to reply to messages from your wrist with one of five customizable templates. Too bad quick replies isn't live yet and won't roll out until May. Another feature that won't arrive till May is ""female health tracking"" -- as in, tracking your menstrual cycle so you can look out for symptoms or when you're ovulating. You can already download apps on your phone that do this, but it'll be nice to see this on your wrist and integrated with the rest of the information Fitbit already has. In addition to the built-in fitness-tracking features, you can also make the Versa more useful by installing third-party apps. Since the Ionic launched, Fitbit has grown its app store, although it's not clear how many of these have been tweaked to fit the Versa's wider face. You'll find nifty options like Yelp, Nest, Philips Hue for smart light control and The New York Times for news updates. I particularly enjoyed playing 2048, even on the Versa's teeny screen. I also appreciate the Versa's relatively long battery life. Fitbit promises you'll get ""four-plus"" days out of it, and indeed the watch conked out after close to five days of use, during which I tracked at least two workouts and four nights of sleep. The Ionic lasts slightly longer, but the difference is not significant. Competition For the price, the Versa's primary competition are the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro and the Apple Watch Series 1 (which costs $250). While both offer similarly robust fitness-tracking tools, the Versa has the edge on battery life -- it's the longest-lasting of the lot. Those who must have built-in GPS should consider the Gear Fit 2 Pro. It looks nothing like a watch, but has almost all the features the Versa does with a bigger, brilliant display. You can play Spotify tracks offline, monitor your swims and map your runs phone-free. We haven't reviewed it yet, so we can't vouch for the battery life, but Samsung promises it will last three to four days. Owners of iPhones may prefer an Apple Watch, although the Series is getting old. It lags behind the Fitbit in battery life and probably won't be available for that much longer. If you're after an Apple Watch and its superior compatibility with iOS, you're better off shelling out the $80 extra it'll cost to get a Series 3 model with GPS.

"Kevin Makice on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","Once upon a time, I was a wizard named Gandalf. It is an unimaginative moniker, admittedly, but it came from a tween who just finished reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy. As Gandalf, I knew a few common spells, for protection and attack, and could speak dwarvish. I declared my alignment to be Lawful Good, naturally, and went about my business seeking gold and magical treasure. By the time I rolled ability scores for Gandalf—my first role-playing game character—Dungeons &amp; Dragons had been out a couple years. My most geeky friends and I would get together on Saturdays or during sleepovers to pretend we were medieval fantasy heroes, battling Lizardmen and Beholders in search of the elusive +2 Vorpal Blade. Even as I stashed my 20-sided die into storage when I headed to college, I couldn’t wait for the day I could get it back out and role-play with my kids. It’s a good time to get into Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the role-playing game featured in Stranger… Read more Read In 2010, I bought my two sons the Fourth Edition starter kit for D&amp;D, which is made of a collection of nuanced rules. The game lost my kids’ interest before their first characters could swing an axe. I could empathize. Arguing fine print is as much a signature of the game as the crazy dice. Many of my D&amp;D sessions as a kid and an adult wasted lots of time trying to get an adventure started, or looking up specific rules as situations surfaced. To make my childhood pastime more accessible to my kids, I had to iterate. Keep It Simple, Sorcerer At the time, my solution was coming up with a stripped-down version of D&amp;D (“DnDish”) that threw out all but the most essential parts of the experience. In doing so, I gutted the rules and only kept the crucial parts: Create a character, Roll the dice, Level up. The rest relied on our collective imagination. With the release of the Fifth Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons in 2014, the official rule set now addresses some of the obstacles my family encountered trying to learn the game. However, there are still some things you can do to simplify 5E and improve the experience for your kids. The biggest threat to an enjoyable RPG session is attention span, so all of your house rules should be implemented with three goals in mind: Quicken the pace to first action. Minimize reference lookups. Keep players engaged at session end. These goals can be achieved with a combination of rules omissions and game preparation by the Dungeon Master, the person most responsible for moving the adventure forward. Hide What You Don’t Use Battling some easy monsters early will help a new player learn how their armor, weapons and magic work. That knowledge will last into future sessions, but the little-used bits will likely to force a DM to consult the books. While you thumb through one of the three main D&amp;D guides or surf an online resource, your kids may find more interesting things to do. To avoid costly reference checks, don’t play with the parts that prompt research. When you can’t eliminate reference checks, consider making the information you need easier to find. Create simple one-page cheat sheets that contain only the most useful information. Try to reduce all the books into four key pages—Character creation, Player actions, a Shopping list, and Leveling up. If something doesn’t fit on a sheet, don’t use it. Decisions Are an Investment In D&amp;D, a lot of decisions are required to create your character. For new players or those attempting to use an unfamiliar character class or race, those options can delay the start of action for everyone. The quicker you can get to the first monster, the better. There are 9 core races and 12 classes in 5E, though most are rarely used. You can reduce a lot of complexity by making everyone use a Human Fighter as a character template, but let them play as anything they can imagine. In my own kids’ adventures, we had Oracle Ducks, Toddler Plumbers, and Walking Goldfish Chef Wannabes. Under the hood, though, is a single D&amp;D archetype. Some boxes on the standard D&amp;D character sheet are vital. You need a name, of course, and an alignment. (Kids usually choose Lawful Good, but play Chaotic Neutral.) Ability scores and their modifiers drive most of the game play. There are also a handful of derived stats—like initiative, passive wisdom, armor class, speed, and hit points—that are used regularly. The rest of the sheet looks open-ended but is actually backed by a lot of structure found in the Player’s Handbook. If you replace that structure with negotiation, kids’ imaginations will create their own constraints. Don’t offer an option to play a pre-rolled character. While that will certainly get you to game action quickest, players tend to be less invested in characters they didn’t create. That makes it easier for them to disengage later or make reckless choices in game. Let Weaknesses Become Strengths When creating characters, it isn’t uncommon to see a bunch of low numbers and hear, “That didn’t count.” Re-rolling to get an acceptable set of high numbers guarantees your character will start strong, but playing with low scores inspires creativity. In FATE, another RPG platform, character traits are treated as double-edged swords. Every strength can be a weakness, and vice versa. This is a valuable perspective to take when encouraging kids to play with bad rolls. The DM has the power to make use of ambiguity to reward weaker characters for embracing their faults, or to turn strengths against others. The smartest tactician can overthink a plan, and the dumbest tank can be insightful. Playing tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder thankfully doesn’t carry the same… Read more Read Use Fewer Dice More Often Rolling dice is the most enjoyable part of an RPG. It combines player control with destiny. Since the dice only come out when there is some challenge to overcome, there is always an anticipation that the story could take a dramatic turn. Players shouldn’t be rolling dice for every action, but asking a character to roll when player attention wanes will increase engagement for everyone without having to rely on endless monster battles. In D&amp;D, there are typically seven dice—d4, d6, d8, 2d10, d12 and d20—but most of the action can revolve around just two. A 20-sided die is used heavily in battle and in skills checks. Rolls of 20 (critical success) and 1 (critical failure) allow the DM to augment an outcome to cause extra joy or pain to a character. d20 is the signature die for D&amp;D. The rest of the dice are most often related to damage inflicted by different weapons or to facilitate larger lookup tables. By replacing these dice with the most familiar one—d6—you can reduce the frequency of the common question, “Which dice to I use?” Clearly Separate the Context of Conversations Bored kids get goofy and say funny things. There is a difference, however, between Susy insulting an Orc and her character Pickles the Bard doing it. Within a game, poor behavior can have deadly consequences. Out of the game, the DM and players can talk more freely without their characters picking an unwise fight. Use of conventions like “In Game” and “Out of Game” help to delineate what is exploratory or offhand and what is a game decision that could impact the narrative. End Before They Are Ready The younger the kids, the less stamina they likely have for a long gaming session. I try to adhere to a Three Encounter rule, where the goal is to get three opportunities for experience in any gaming session before stopping. This means a 90 minute to 2 hour session is a reasonable duration, long enough to get players in a flow but not so long that we’ve overstayed the welcome. It helps future game play to wrap things up while the players are all paying good attention. Gaming sessions are like episodes in a TV show. While I try to resolve the last encounter before closing the session, I like to leave with a hint of the next mystery or drop in surprise character at the end. Doing so generates conversation in between sessions and makes it easier to ramp up the next time we play. Make Leveling Up Simple Leveling up a character is an intermittent reward for continued play. The economics of experience points is such that it takes an increasing amount to reach the next level. In D&amp;D, point values vary from one monster or action to the next. Rather than deal with those nuances, I award the same points for each encounter. Every character who participates earns those points. Forward movement in the story is still incentivized—the more encounters, the more points—but it de-emphasizes individual achievement. Don’t delay gratification. Because my kid-focused games have unreliable attendance, we have to deal with characters who don’t progress at the same pace. The last thing I do in a gaming session is award experience points. This avoids an awkward situation in the next session where some players have to watch as others use previously-earned points to increase ability and power. Manage All Character Sheets Unless you enjoy rolling up new stats and backstory every week, it is a good idea to collect the character sheets at the end of each session. Not only does this lessen the chance of a player losing theirs, but it allows you to review the character abilities between sessions to cater the next chapter of the adventure. Between doodling and injury, a character sheet can become overrun with pencil marks. If you keep a digital copy of the character sheets, you can update and reprint them to keep everything legible. A DM should know how to play the full game, even if the players don’t. If you are brand new to D&amp;D yourself but are interested in learning it, odds are good you already know someone who runs a game. An estimated 20 million people have played D&amp;D since it was created, and the long public playtesting of 5E has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the RPG. Once you know the rules, it will be easier to find the places to break them and make the experience more enjoyable for your kids.","Once upon a time, I was a wizard named Gandalf.

Natasha Lomas,"Last month Qualcomm rejected a $70 per share acquisition offer from Broadcom — but the rival chipmaker isn’t stepping away. Today it’s announced it’s nominated a slate of eleven directors for Qualcomm’s board. The move puts pressure on Qualcomm’s board to engage with Broadcom’s approach by paving the way for its own shareholders to vote for a takeover which the board already rebuffed. Qualcomm is due to hold an annual meeting of stockholders on March 6, 2018. Broadcom says its earlier acquisition offer represents a 28% premium over the closing price of Qualcomm’s common stock on November 2, 2017, aka the last unaffected trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction; and a premium of 33% to Qualcomm’s unaffected 30-day volume-weighted average price. But Qualcomm’s board continue to argue the offer “dramatically” undervalues the company. In a statement confirming receipt of a slate of candidates from Broadcom today, Qualcomm also played up regulatory uncertainty around the transaction, and urged shareholders to support the existing board of “world-class directors” — emphasizing that nine are independent and four have been added in the last three years. It further described the move as “a blatant attempt to seize control of the Qualcomm Board in order to advance Broadcom’s acquisition agenda” — arguing that the nominees are “inherently conflicted given Broadcom’s desire to acquire Qualcomm in a manner that dramatically undervalues Qualcomm to Broadcom’s benefit”. “No company in the industry is better positioned than Qualcomm in mobile, IoT, automotive, edge computing and networking and to lead the transition to 5G,” said Tom Horton, Qualcomm’s presiding director, in a statement. “Qualcomm stockholders expect a Board that will support this innovation while evaluating objectively the full range of opportunities available to maximize value for all Qualcomm stockholders.” In its own statement, Broadcom’s Hock Tan, president and CEO, said the company’s “strong preference” is to engage in what he described as “a constructive dialogue with Qualcomm”. But he also reiterated that the rival has entirely rebuffed its approach thus far. “We have repeatedly attempted to engage with Qualcomm, and despite stockholder and customer support for the transaction, Qualcomm has ignored those opportunities. The nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm’s directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us,” he said. “In light of the significant value our proposal provides for Qualcomm stockholders, we believe Qualcomm stockholders would be better served by new independent, highly qualified nominees who are committed to maximizing value and acting in the best interests of Qualcomm stockholders.” The full list of Broadcom’s nominees can be found here. If the nominees are elected, Broadcom added that it would support a decision by them to increase the size of the Qualcomm Board and reappoint Mark D. McLaughlin, Anthony J. “Tony” Vinciquerra and Jeffrey W. Henderson as directors.

During the trial on Wednesday witnesses revealed he paid for extravagant splurges through wire transfers from foreign bank accounts.

WINNIE HU,"“It’s not fair, it’s not equitable,” she said. “All kids should have access to all the schools — and not because you live in a certain neighborhood and your parents have access to certain resources.” At the request of parents and local elected officials, the city education department spent $150,000 to hire an urban planning firm, WXY Studio, to lead a community process to come up with a way to integrate the middle schools. Hundreds of parents and educators have worked collaboratively over the past year — largely avoiding the drama of District 3 — on a plan that will be presented this summer. In District 3, a battle erupted two years ago when school zones were redrawn to reduce crowding and increase diversity at elementary schools. One of the schools involved was Public School 199, a high-performing elementary school on the Upper West Side where parents hire tutors to ensure their children excel on state tests, and where the angry meeting caught on video took place. The district’s middle-school effort has drawn a variety of criticisms from parents. Some say it is unfair, since there are not enough seats for all the qualified applicants at the top schools, and that it could lower the quality of education. Others say it doesn’t do enough to help lower-performing middle schools. Robin Aronow, a school consultant, said that she had received a flood of calls from parents who are anxious about the plan and are considering applying to private schools in addition to public schools. City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Democrat from the Upper West Side, said the goal should be to increase the academic and economic diversity in every school, though she also understood the concerns raised by some white, middle-class parents. “This is about, ‘I don’t want to lose a spot for my kid,’” she said. Under the plan that was initially unveiled, every District 3 school would offer 10 percent of its sixth-grade seats to students who average a 1 on state tests — the lowest grade on a 1-to-4 scale — and another 15 percent to those who average a 2. For the current school year, only 11 percent of Booker T. Washington’s 299 admission offers went to these students.","At the Booker T. Washington Middle School, less than a quarter of the students are black or Hispanic, in a district where children from those groups make up half the population.",2018-05-17T22:09:48Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘It Has to Start Somewhere’: Grass-Roots Drive to Integrate New York Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/it-has-to-start-somewhere-grass-roots-drive-to-integrate-new-york-schools.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/nyregion/18DESEG1/00deseg-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
Joe Rossignol,"A new class action lawsuit filed against Apple this week alleges that all Apple Watch models suffer from a defect that causes the display to ""crack, shatter, or detach from the body of the watch, through no fault of the wearer."" The proposed class is all current and former owners of all models, sizes, and variants of the Apple Watch, including the original, Series 1, Series 2, and Series 3 generations, purchased in the United States between April 2015 and present, according to court documents obtained by MacRumors. The complaint, filed in Northern California district court, alleges that Apple has sold millions of watches with the defect throughout the United States, and ""either knew, or should have known,"" about the display issues. Apple is said to have ""actively concealed"" and ""failed to disclose"" the defect to customers. The complaint adds that Apple's internal policy is to ""deny the existence of the defect, claim the defect is the result of accidental damage caused by consumers, and then refuse to honor its limited warranty on those grounds,"" resulting in customers facing expensive fees to repair or replace their defective watches. Apple Watch out-of-warranty service fees range from $229 to $329 in the United States, excluding high-end Edition models. The lawsuit was brought against Apple by Colorado resident Kenneth Sciacca, who purchased an Apple Watch Series 2 in December 2016. In or around March 2018, the screen on Sciacca's watch is said to have ""unexpectedly detached from the watch's body shortly after he removed the watch from its charger."" The complaint cites a handful of comments from the Apple Support Communities, and similar complaints can be found scattered across the MacRumors forums, Reddit, Twitter, and other discussion platforms. Apple has acknowledged issues with swollen batteries in select original and Series 2 models, which can cause the display to pop off, and offered free repairs up to three years after purchase, according to internal guidelines previously obtained by MacRumors. However, the complaint alleges that Apple refuses to extend the free repairs to watches with detached displays but no swollen battery. Apple is accused of unlawful business acts and practices, in violation of California's Business and Professions Code, in addition to violating California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, breaching express and implied warranties, and unjust enrichment. The complaint is seeking damages to fully compensate affected Apple Watch owners for all losses sustained as a result of the alleged defect, plus further relief as seen fit by the court. A jury trial has been demanded.","A new class action lawsuit filed against Apple this week alleges that all Apple Watch models suffer from a defect that causes the display to ""crack, shatter, or detach from the body of the watch, through no fault of the wearer.""

Rhett Jones,"Last Summer, Equifax experienced one of the most devastating data breaches in history. In an incredible stroke of luck, several executives had dumped their stock in the company prior to the news going public. They were cleared of wrongdoing, but on Wednesday, the SEC filed insider trading charges against a different executive for his own fortuitous cash-out. Jun Ying, former chief information officer of Equifax’s US consumer reporting division, is accused of using confidential information to avoid $117,000 worth of losses on his Equifax stock. According to the SEC complaint, Ying was informed about the data breach at the credit reporting agency, which reportedly compromised the personal data of more than 145 million Americans. He proceeded to research the impact a similar breach had on the stock of Experian Plc and realized his Equifax holdings were likely to take a hit. The sale of Ying’s vested stock options totaled close to $1 million. As Richard Best, director of the SEC’s Atlanta regional office, explained in a statement : “As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach, and he dumped his stock before the news went public. Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit.” When news of Equifax’s data breach first appeared, reports emerged that the company had been warned about the vulnerability in its system six months before attackers took advantage of it. The flaw in its data infrastructure gave hackers the ability to access the personal data of Equifax’s customers, but executives allegedly failed to ensure it was patched. Suspiciously, four top executives had also sold a total of $1.8 million worth of stock in the weeks leading up to Equifax’s official discovery and public disclosure of the vulnerability. All four executives were cleared of wrongdoing for various reasons after an internal investigation by Equifax. Mr. Ying was not one of those four extremely lucky men. His activities were discovered by Equifax and quickly turned over to the SEC. According to the complaint, Ying was CC’d on an email in August about an emergency project involving a “VERY large breach Opportunity.” Ying proceed to text one of his subordinates, the SEC alleges, in which he wrote: “On the phone with [global CIO]. Sounds bad. We may be the one breached.... Starting to put 2 and 2 together.” After adding up the equation, Ying allegedly concluded this was a prime time to exercise his stock options. He pocketed “more than $950,000.” When contacted for comment by Gizmodo, Equifax sent us a statement from Interim CEO Paulino Do Rego Barros, Junior. “Upon learning about Mr. Ying’s August sale of Equifax shares, we launched a review of his trading activity, concluded he violated our company’s trading policies, separated him from the company and reported our findings to government authorities,” he wrote. “We are fully cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC, and will continue to do so.” There is certainly plenty of cooperating still to be done—by Bloomberg ’s count, Equifax still “faces more than 240 class-action lawsuits and more than 60 regulatory or government inquiries.” [ SEC ]","Last Summer, Equifax experienced one of the most devastating data breaches in history.

At the time of publication, we had heard directly from three of the companies: Microsoft, Rackspace and DigitalOcean. In the case of Google, we learned their response indirectly through a published blog post. We have not yet heard from AWS or IBM. Microsoft “We’re aware of this industry-wide issue and have been working closely with chip manufacturers to develop and test mitigations to protect our customers. We are in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and are releasing security updates today to protect Windows customers against vulnerabilities affecting supported hardware chips from AMD, ARM and Intel. We have not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been used to attack our customers.” Google “As soon as we learned of this new class of attack, our security and product development teams mobilized to defend Google’s systems and our users’ data. We have updated our systems and affected products to protect against this new type of attack. We also collaborated with hardware and software manufacturers across the industry to help protect their users and the broader web. These efforts have included collaborative analysis and the development of novel mitigations.” (See here, here, here and here for additional blog posts from Google outlining their responses.) DigitalOcean “DigitalOcean has been actively investigating the Intel chip issue which was disclosed earlier today. We’ve been working to gather as much information as we can to ensure our customers remain protected. Intel unfortunately has not made it easy to get a full picture of the issue due to their information embargo. At this time we are working under the assumption that this flaw will impact all of our customers and we’re presuming that rebooting Droplets (a DigitalOcean cloud server) will be necessary. We will be providing advanced notification to any and all customers impacted as we learn more. This is a developing issue and we are unable to forecast timeframes for implementing a fix at this time.” (See DigitalOcean’s blog pos t for additional details.) Rackspace “On 2 January 2018, Rackspace was made aware of a suspected Intel CPU architecture vulnerability. The full extent and performance impact of this vulnerability and potential remediation are currently unknown as the vulnerability has not yet been publicly disclosed. Our engineers are engaging with the appropriate vendors and reviewing the Rackspace environment and will take appropriate action. Should actions that would impact customer environments be taken Rackspace will communicate to affected customers.” Should additional responses become available, we will continue to update this article.

Antonio Villas-Boas,"It seems that some issues with the Apple Watch Series 2— where some users complained of swelling batteries and screens that pop off — could have made it to some 2017 models of the more recent Apple Watch Series 3. 
 New Jersey resident Gina Priano-Keyser has filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Apple, seeking damages over claims that the screen of her Apple Watch Series 3 detached off the watch's main body and cracked. The filing says that Priano-Keyser's daughter tried to push the screen back into place, but the Apple Watch has reportedly been ""unusable"" ever since, according to MacRumors, which first reported on the lawsuit. 
 That's a similar problem to one that some Apple Watch Series 2 owners faced. In April 2018, Apple offered free repairs on defective Apple Watch Series 2 models for up to three years. But Priano-Kayser claims that Apple denied an in-warranty repair for her Apple Watch Series 3 in August 2018, and was quoted an out-of-warranty cost of $229 to fix it. 
 And so, Priano-Keyser engaged the services of the Shepherd, Finkelman, Miller &amp; Shah, LLP law firm to sue Apple, claiming that all models of Apple Watch are affected by a manufacturing flaw that causes the battery to swell. 
 The proposed class-action lawsuit alleges that all versions of the Apple Watch so far can have screens that pop off or crack because of ""aging or otherwise faulty li-on batteries, or by defective internal components of the Watches that regulate temperature, electrical currents, charging, and other mechanisms that could affect the Watches' li-on batteries."" 
 The suit also alleges that all Apple Watch generations ""contain the same defect and/or flaw, specifically, swelling lithium-ion (or ""li-on"") batteries, which in turn cause Apple Watch screens to crack, shatter, or detach from the body of the Watch (the ""Defect""), through no fault of the wearer, oftentimes only days or weeks after purchase."" 
 The filing further claims that Apple ""either knew, or should have known, that the Watches contain the Defect and are not fit for their intended purpose."" 
 The class-action lawsuit proposal cites over a dozen similar complaints that users submitted in Apple's support forums. Still, it's not clear just how many users might actually be affected by similar problems with their Apple Watch Series 3.

Ron Miller,"Leena AI, a recent Y Combinator graduate focusing on HR chatbots to help employees answer questions like how much vacation time they have left, announced a $2 million seed round today from a variety of investors. Company co-founder and CEO Adit Jain says the seed money is about scaling the company and gaining customers. They hope to have 50 enterprise customers within the next 12-18 months. They currently have 16. We wrote about the company in June when it was part of the Y Combinator Summer 2018 class. At the time Jain explained that they began in 2015 in India as a company called Chatteron. The original idea was to help others build chatbots, but like many startups, they realized there was a need not being addressed, in this case around HR, and they started Leena AI last year to focus specifically on that. As they delved deeper into the HR problem, they found most employees had trouble getting answers to basic questions like how much vacation time they had or how to get a new baby on their health insurance. This forced a call to a help desk when the information was available online, but not always easy to find. Jain pointed out that most HR policies are defined in policy documents, but employees don’t always know where they are. They felt a chatbot would be a good way to solve this problem and save a lot of time searching or calling for answers that should be easily found. What’s more, they learned that the vast majority of questions are fairly common and therefore easier for a system to learn. Employees can access the Leena chatbot in Slack, Workplace by Facebook, Outlook, Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams and Cisco Spark. They also offer Web and mobile access to their service independent of these other tools. Photo: Leena AI What’s more, since most companies use a common set of backend HR systems like those from Oracle, SAP and NetSuite (also owned by Oracle), they have been able to build a set of standard integrators that are available out of the box with their solution. The customer provides Leena with a handbook or a set of policy documents and they put their machine learning to work on that. Jain says, armed with this information, they can convert these documents into a structured set of questions and answers and feed that to the chatbot. They apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the question being asked and provide the correct answer. They see room to move beyond HR and expand into other departments such as sales or customer service that could also take advantage of bots to answer a set of common questions. For now, as a recent YC graduate, they have their first bit of significant funding and they will concentrate on building HR chatbots and see where that takes them.","Leena AI, a recent Y Combinator graduate focusing on HR chatbots to help employees answer questions like how much vacation time they have left, announced a $2 million seed round today from a variety of investors.

JESSE McKINLEY and NICK CORASANITI,"The tax plan does harm high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, primarily by eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes, or SALT, and capping the deduction for property taxes at $10,000. In New York, some 725,000 New York households would be subject to higher taxes under the proposed property tax cap, with 2.4 million also hit by increased income tax bills resulting from the SALT elimination, according to Mr. Cuomo’s office. But even in New York, the effects of the tax plan would not be felt evenly. The four Republican Congress members who voted for the plan — Chis Collins, John Katko, Claudia Tenney and Mr. Reed — represent districts in Central and Western New York with more low-income areas than their Republican colleagues closer to New York City. In the upstate districts, the tax plan would benefit those whose incomes are more moderate, they argue, and who take the standardized deduction, which would be nearly doubled under the plan. As such, the tax plan has also provided some upstate Republicans with a pure populist message: The tax bill helps as many working-class families as it hurts the upper stratus. Mr. Collins, a constant critic of Mr. Cuomo, said the notion that many well-to-do downstaters would have to “suck it up” and pay more taxes was fine by him. Photo Representative Chris Collins, a Republican and frequent critic of Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, has cast the battle over the tax plan as a choice between helping working-class taxpayers or wealthier residents. Credit Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via Associated Press “We never said we were going to protect the top one or 2 percent,” Mr. Collins said in an interview on Thursday. “The juxtaposition is the governor is fighting for the millionaires and billionaires.” On Thursday, the governor once again tried to call attention to what he called the evils of the tax plan, suggesting that Mr. Collins and his fellow Republicans were being shortsighted and insincere, noting that high earners in Republican districts provided an outsize amount of state revenue via taxes. Mr. Cuomo warned against tax migration out of the state if high earners find their taxes increased, saying such a development would cause either future tax increases for the middle class or a gutting of social services which help the poor. “If you lose those taxpayers, you lose their revenue,” the governor said, adding that the tax plan was geared to pay for corporate tax reductions and pay for tax relief in more conservative parts of the country. “They need the money to cut taxes in other states.” The tax bill has already surfaced in some of the more competitive races around the state, including in Utica, where Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat, is the leading contender to take on Ms. Tenney, a Republican. Tim Edson, a spokesman for Ms. Tenney’s campaign, said, “When Anthony Brindisi complains about the Republican tax plan he is admitting guilt — that the high-tax policies he has rubber-stamped for Governor Cuomo are killing New York.” But Mr. Brindisi clearly sees political opportunity as well. “The more sunlight this tax plan gets, the more people hate it,” he said, noting that a Quinnipiac poll shows that more than half of Americans disapprove of the plan while only 29 percent approve. In Albany, Mr. Brindisi is also considering state legislation to address a specific area of concern: the tax plan’s elimination of a deduction for teachers who spend their own money on school supplies. Indeed, Mr. Brindisi says that beyond the property tax cap and the SALT elimination, a number of less-publicized cuts — including deductions for medical expenses and student debt — will also end up hurting the middle class. “Those are deductions that people use,” he said. In New Jersey, the political dynamics are less divided: Four of the five New Jersey Republican congress members voted against the initial House bill, and have signaled that, absent any major changes, they would remain against the bill. The sole Republican to vote for the bill, Representative Tom MacArthur, represents a Central New Jersey district where fewer than half of the households itemize state and local tax deductions, according to his office. And like his colleagues in New York, he argues that the tax bill will be a necessary challenge to a high-tax state like New Jersey to reform its policies that he says causes the high cost of living. “If cutting taxes at the federal level forces Democrats in Trenton to do the same, then this would be a welcome new direction for the state and an even bigger win for New Jersey taxpayers,” Mr. MacArthur said. “I’ll be glad to see them change the tax-and-spend policies that have made us the most overtaxed state in the nation, and I’m sure New Jersey taxpayers would agree.” Photo Representative Tom MacArthur, the sole Republican member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for the tax plan, said he hoped that the federal measure would compel Trenton to lower taxes. Credit Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Even those Republicans who rejected the bills have been taking the debate as a ripe moment to attack their state’s taxes. “Our state and local tax deduction is as high as it is because our state and local taxes are as high as they are,” said Representative Lee Zeldin of Long Island, who has been punished by Republican leadership for voting no on the House bill. “All levels of government should be focused on tax relief.” Mr. Cuomo and his surrogates scoff at the suggestion that the governor is pro-tax, noting several state tax cuts during his nearly seven years in office as well as a cap on local property taxes. Nor do they concede any ground on spending — noting a spending cap during Mr. Cuomo’s time in office — as well as New York’s well-documented status as a “donor state,” sending billions more to Washington than it receives. Moreover, the governor seems proud to tout progressive policies paid for by the state’s $160 billion budget, larger than any state other than California. “Yes, California, New York are high-tax states,” Mr. Cuomo said on National Public Radio on Wednesday. “We have governments. We believe in providing social services and free college tuition, etc. And that’s a decision our states have made.” The governor’s allies were also railing against the plan, including the New York State AFL-CIO, which wrote a letter to the state’s congressional delegation denouncing it as “job-killing,” and arguing it “cuts taxes for the wealthy on the backs of hardworking New Yorkers.” Whether it costs Republicans at the ballot box is an open question. William F.B. O’Reilly, a Republican consultant in New York, called the tax bill “a calculated bet that the cuts, particularly the corporate tax cuts, will kick-start the manufacturing sector enough for working-class Americans to begin feeling optimistic again.” “The problem is that 2019 is too late for electoral considerations,” he said. “Republican members of Congress will be running in ’18 on a promise that may or may not come true.” Such prognostications are probably unsettling for Congress members like John Faso, who is facing a tough re-election fight in his Hudson Valley district. Mr. Faso said he voted no on the tax bill primarily because of worries about the impact of the SALT elimination, which he said he feared “will accelerate the exodus” of residents out of the state. As of now, Mr. Faso said he still would vote no, though he still hoped for changes in the final bill. But he said he wasn’t worried about Mr. Cuomo’s threats, political or otherwise. “There’s a lot of time between now and next November,” he said. “I’ll worry about the politics next year.” A version of this article appears in print on December 8, 2017, on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Republicans Say, if Tax Plan Costs You, Don’t Blame Us.

CHARLES V. BAGLI,"The suit charges the Port Authority with failing to enforce his lease, which gives the Ark “exclusive rights” to handle the animals coming to the airport from overseas. The lease requires that the Port Authority “must use reasonable efforts to cause other providers to cease their provision of the exclusive services.” The project was financed with a combination of conventional loans and tax-free bonds, with Ark responsible for all payments. The heart of the Ark’s business is supposed to be horses coming from Europe, which must be quarantined for at least three days in order to prevent the spread of equine diseases. The Ark’s primary competitor is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 40-year-old operation in Newburgh, N.Y., about 90 miles north of Kennedy Airport. Photo The AirHeart Pet Hospital at Ark, which opened in January 2017 and was called “the world’s only animal terminal and the first full-service quarantine facility” for the import and export of horses, pets, zoo animals and livestock. Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times Most of the hundreds of birds and more than 3,500 horses that enter the United States at Kennedy every year are still put onto trailers for the 2-½-hour ride to Newburgh, even though the cargo planes could practically pull alongside the Ark, where the horses could be transferred to a dolly and wheeled into a stall moments after landing. “I watch them go by my door every day,” Mr. Cuticelli said, “trucked up to Newburgh.” “It makes no sense to me why the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A. and all the other agencies involved in the creation of this facility are not supporting its use,” Mr. Cuticelli said. “I entered into a technically, legally binding contract with exclusivity. Otherwise, I never would have done it.” The Port Authority and the Department of Agriculture declined to discuss the lawsuit. Joelle Hayden, a spokeswoman for the U.S.D.A., did say that her agency “does not mandate use of any one import quarantine facility, airline or animal handling service. We support the use of all approved entities and services.” And a spokesman for the Port Authority said in a statement that the “limited exclusivity provision enables the private veterinary clinic to provide the first-class facility and services that J.F.K. requested.” Critics, mostly shipping agents and transporters, said that the privately owned Ark was too expensive and unnecessary, given the existence of the Newburgh operation. But Dr. Scarlette Gotwals, a veterinarian and director of flight operations for Horse America, a shipping agent, said she was mystified as to why Ark has not been embraced by the horse industry. “This is exactly what we’ve been looking for,” said Ms. Gotwals, the first shipper to bring horses to the Ark in September. “It’s a world-class facility. It’s an indoor, climate-controlled facility. In Newburgh, you’re using outdoor barns.” She said the price difference, which amounted to a couple of hundred dollars, was “not cost prohibitive.” Mr. Cuticelli, who described himself as a “broken down real estate investor,” got involved with the project at the urging of Ken Rotondo, a veterinarian and a former member of the advisory council at Cornell University’s veterinary college.

Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times In 2010, the Port Authority solicited companies willing to build a first-class animal facility at Kennedy Airport. “I proposed moving quarantine” to Kennedy, instead of going to Newburgh, Dr. Rotondo recalled. The Port Authority awarded the contract to Dr. Rotondo’s group, he said, “without going to bid.” After Dr. Rotondo retired, Mr. Cuticelli took over. Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the former airport facility “fell far below the minimum appropriate standards.” “The Ark contract was tailored,” he said, “to enable the private contractor to make the necessary investment to build and operate a world-class facility.” After three years of negotiations, the Ark signed a 310-page lease in 2014. However, in 2015, the Port Authority signed a 20-year lease with the U.S.D.A. operation in Newburgh, on the grounds of Stewart Airport. Thomas Bosco, then director of aviation for the Port Authority, recommended that the authority’s board approve the lease, saying that the “Ark does not provide quarantine services.” It was a puzzling statement given that Ark had signed a lease requiring it to provide that service. Before construction could begin, Ark had to wait for the Port Authority to remove the heart of the airport’s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System, a high-tech system of cameras, radar and sensors. Ark also had to comply with various regulations and requirements imposed by the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A., the Center for Disease Control, state and local health departments and the Department of Homeland Security. The delays and requirements drove the cost of the project from $48 million to $65 million, Mr. Cuticelli said. He obtained private financing, put up $12 million of his own money and New York City provided a $35 million bond. Ark opened in January 2017, although the U.S.D.A did not approve the equine quarantine for imported horses until September. Business was slow. Photo Most of the more than 3,500 horses that enter the United States at Kennedy every year are still put onto trailers for the 2-½-hour ride to Newburgh, N.Y., even though the cargo planes could practically pull alongside the Ark, where the horses could be transferred to a dolly and wheeled into a stall moments after landing. Credit Johnny Milano for The New York Times Mr. Cuticelli said he does not know whether he has stumbled into some bureaucratic nightmare with the Port Authority, a turf war between government agencies, or is the object of a boycott by livestock shipping agents and transporters. “There are two big issues,” said Matt Haug, general manager for IRT Transport, which transports livestock internationally. “People aren’t acquainted with them. The other issue is the traffic difficulties at Kennedy Airport. Newburgh is situated near the interstates.” “Nobody asked for an import facility,” said a shipper, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to become embroiled in the litigation. “I don’t know how this became a $65 million facility. They’ll never recoup their money.” A Port Authority official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, blamed federal officials. “It’s no secret that the U.S.D.A. has not been friendly to this facility,” he said. The official said the Port Authority was trying to work out the issues with the U.S.D.A. Ark’s lease does appear to give it exclusivity, which is also generating friction with the horse racing industry. The New York Racing Association, which operates several tracks including Aqueduct and Belmont Park near Kennedy Airport, has built its own U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barns for international horse races, enabling the horse to compete right after it leaves quarantine. The 40 or so racehorses a year that fly into Kennedy from Europe, Japan and elsewhere for races within two weeks of landing represent only a fraction of the total expected volume. In December, Dora J. Delgado, a senior vice president of racing and nominations for the Breeders Cup, sent a letter to the U.S.D.A. expressing its concerns about the Port Authority’s plans to require “international equine athletes” to use Ark, rather than the U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barn at Belmont. Alison McGowan, who runs Ternary Performance Horses on Long Island, was importing two show horses from Belgium and Holland in September. She said she told her shipper — whom she declined to name — on numerous occasions that she wanted the horses taken to Ark. The day before the horses were to leave Amsterdam, she discovered that the shipper planned to take them to Newburgh. She canceled the flight and hired a new shipper, Ms. Gotwals, who brought the horses to Ark. “For me as a horse owner,” Ms. McGowan said, “I would never ship horses halfway across the world on a long flight and then put them on a trailer for 2.5 hours to quarantine. The Ark is outstanding. I’d rather have a state-of-the-art facility providing the best care.” Mr. Cuticelli said he may not be able to wait much longer. “What sense does it make to build a multi-, multmillion-dollar state-of-the-art facility to, among other things, mitigate the risk of hoof-and-mouth disease contamination, and then do what they are doing,” said his lawyer, Stephen B. Meister. “It’s totally insane.” A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2018, on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Ark Owner Seethes as ‘Animal Terminal’ Sits Empty at Kennedy Airport.

NOEL MURRAY,"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here. Are “sophomore slumps” real? That’s the question faced by this April’s television lineup, as three highly acclaimed shows — HBO’s “Westworld,” FX’s “Legion” and Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” — all try to follow stellar first seasons with equally strong second ones. Other questions to ask this month: Can “Bosch” and “Brockmire” continue their under-the-radar excellence? Will work by the authors Ian McEwan and E.M. Forster translate well to the small screen? And can Netflix finally make a “Lost in Space” that becomes must-see TV? There’s a lot to ponder this spring. Here’s some of what’s in store: ‘The Child in Time’ Aired: April 1, on PBS Save to Watch Like Benedict Cumberbatch is both the star and a producer in this Masterpiece movie, based on an early Ian McEwan novel about a successful children’s author whose child is abducted. Kelly Macdonald plays his estranged wife, who years after the kidnapping is having trouble coming to grips with what happened. “The Child in Time” promises to touch on themes typical of McEwan’s writing: contextualizing the extremes of human experience and showing how even the most mundane moments shape how we react to tragedy. — ‘The Crossing’ Started: April 2, on ABC Save to Watch Like Like many sci-fi sagas, ABC’s new time-travel drama “The Crossing” uses a fantastical premise to comment on the real world of its time. Steve Zahn stars as a small-town Oregon sheriff who finds himself at the center of an unexpected crisis when dozens of strangers spontaneously appear on a nearby shore, claiming to be American refugees from a war they say will happen 180 years from now. As the visitors from the future share news of a divided world to come, the country of today grapples with how these newcomers — some of whom have special abilities — fit into an already fractious society. — ‘The Last O.G.’ Started: April 3, TBS Save to Watch Like Tracy Morgan returns to television in this broad but quietly ambitious sitcom, playing an ex-con who comes back to Brooklyn after 15 years in prison — only to find that both his old neighborhood and the culture at large are very different. “The Last O.G.” was created in part by the newly minted Oscar-winner Jordan Peele; it also features Tiffany Haddish as the hero’s ex-girlfriend, who tries to help him adjust — even though she has changed a lot, herself. This is ultimately Morgan’s show, however, and it rises and falls on his character’s alternately outraged and wistful reactions to a world where “Brooklyn” has become an adjective. — ‘ Legion ’ (Season 2) Started: April 3, FX Save to Watch Like The first season of this mind-bending Marvel Comics superhero show from FX introduced David Haller (played by Dan Stevens), a telekinetic mutant so powerful that he can’t always tell whether he’s mentally ill or he can actually warp reality with his mind. By the end of the first eight episodes, the hero and his allies had at least temporarily fended off the shadowy government agents and the supernatural villain hounding them. For Season 2, the writer-producer Noah Hawley plans to expand this quasi-psychedelic, prog-rock-inspired universe while taking further advantage of his appealingly eccentric supporting cast — which includes the magnificent Aubrey Plaza as a slippery chaos agent. — ‘Howards End’ Starts: April 8, Starz Save to Watch Like The multi-Oscar-winning 1992 movie version of E.M. Forster’s novel “Howards End” was one of the most popular films from the producing-directing-screenwriting team of Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and it helped initiate a wave of high-class literary adaptations and period dramas. This new four-part TV mini-series — already acclaimed during its BBC run last year — was written by Kenneth Lonergan and stars Hayley Atwell as a freethinking aristocrat who attempts to bridge the gap between her old-money and working-class friends. As with the film and the book, the TV adaptation concerns the inequitable distribution of privilege, between classes and genders. — ‘Killing Eve’ Starts: April 8, BBC America Save to Watch Like The British writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge is best-known for creating and starring in the slice-of-life comedy series “Fleabag,” but her new show “Killing Eve” is a real change of pace. Based on the work of the novelist Luke Jennings, this cat-and-mouse thriller stars Sandra Oh as a meticulous secret agent whose latest assignment involves chasing down a skilled but psychopathic assassin (Jodie Comer) whom she secretly admires. Although “Killing Eve” is about two women trying to murder each other, expect Waller-Bridge to spend at least some time each episode exploring how people become trapped by their own senses of self. — ‘Bosch’ (Season 4) Starts: April 13, Amazon Save to Watch Like In its first season, this Amazon adaptation of the novelist Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch police procedurals came across more like a heavy prestige drama than the sophisticated genre show it was always meant to be. Seasons 2 and 3 corrected its course, leaning more on Connelly’s clever plotting and his eclectic cast of characters, many of whom represent conflicting aspects of the Los Angeles criminal justice system. The sense that law and order in Los Angeles is a delicate structure held in place by bitter rivalries should be a prominent element of Season 4, which is based on the book “Angels Flight,” wherein Detective Bosch investigates the murder of a crusading, anti-cop attorney. — ‘Lost in Space’ Starts: April 13, Netflix Save to Watch Like The original 1960s version of “Lost in Space” was cheap-looking and hopelessly square, but still found a devoted fan base, thanks in large part to its depiction of a loving family — and their helpful robot — surviving the universe’s dangerous unknowns by sticking together. Judging from the early trailers, Netflix’s remake is going to be much more special effects-driven, and hipper to boot, with Molly Parker taking the lead as the Robinson clan’s matriarch and Parker Posey playing the morally ambiguous opportunist Dr. Smith. — Save to Watch Like HBO has had a tough time producing another series as talked-about and internationally successful as “Game of Thrones.” But given how much chatter the first season of “Westworld” generated, it is likely that Season 2 — arriving nearly a year and a half later — could become a sensation. After a finale in December of 2016 that spilled some big secrets and shook up the power structure at the show’s futuristic, robot-populated theme park, the story seems poised to move into another phase, expanding the action to incorporate new locations, new characters and new mysteries for fans to argue about online. — Save to Watch Like One of the 2017 TV season’s most pleasant surprises, the raunchy comedy “Brockmire” took what seemed like a thin concept — an alcoholic former major league baseball announcer tries to resuscitate his career in the minor leagues — and gave it unexpected depth and soul. Last year ended on a mini-cliffhanger, as that comeback threatened the budding romance between Jim Brockmire (Hank Azaria) with the woman who helped save him: a sports-loving small-town entrepreneur played by the excellent Amanda Peet. Fans of Season 1 are no doubt looking forward to more of Jim’s rich-toned, colorfully phrased vulgarity, along with more of the show’s nuanced understanding of what “success” means in 21st-century America. — Save to Watch Like Season 2 of this Hulu adaptation of the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood will have a hard time topping Season 1, which scored an Emmy for best drama series (unprecedented for a streaming series) and also became a relevant conversation piece in a year when sexist privilege made international headlines. But on the assumption that Elisabeth Moss will continue to give a superb performance as a sex slave in a theocratic society — and with Marisa Tomei, Cherry Jones and Clea DuVall joining the cast — there’s plenty of reason to believe this show will keep going strong, even as it moves further beyond the source material. — Also of interest: “King in the Wilderness” (HBO, April 2), “Famous in Love” (Freeform, April 4), “National Treasure: Kiri” (Hulu, April 4), “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” (MTV, April 5), “The Boss Baby: Back in Business” (Netflix, April 6), “Paterno” (HBO, April 7), “An American Murder Mystery: The Staircase” (ID, April 8), “Unforgotten” (PBS, April 8), “New Girl” (Fox, April 10), “Rellik” (Cinemax, April 13), “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas” (HBO, April 13), “The Circus” (Showtime, April 15), “Fear the Walking Dead” (AMC, April 15), “Civilizations” (PBS, April 17), “Into the Badlands” (AMC, April 22), “The 100” (The CW, April 24), “Genius” (Nat Geo, April 24), “Archer” (FXX, April 25) and “Dancing With the Stars” (ABC, April 30).","“The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Westworld” are back, along with a fresh crop of promising new drama, comedy and sci-fi series.",2018-04-05T15:47:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",11 Shows We’ll Be Talking About in April,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/watching/westworld-handmaids-tale-whats-on-tv.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/watching/april-tv-watching/04americans-slide-GXL1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-2,1
THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,"Trump has no answer for that. He doesn’t believe the climate science that NASA is telling him is true. He is trying to bring back coal precisely when wind, solar and efficiency are becoming cheaper, cleaner, healthier alternatives — precisely when four of the five biggest wind states are red states and precisely when China has committed itself to owning the clean power and electric car markets of the future! He’s trying to force the U.S. auto industry to bring back gas guzzlers when the last time we did that — from the 1980s to the 2000s — Japan and Korea bankrupted Detroit and we enriched petro-dictators from Venezuela to Russia to the Arab world to Iran. Trump is the president who’s throwing away our umbrella right before the storm. Sure, Trump will sneer that “green” is girlyman, uneconomic, unpatriotic and vaguely French. But Democrats can easily counter that green is globally strategic, locally profitable and working class — green is the new red, white and blue. That message can play today in Rust Belt battleground states like Michigan and Ohio. One recent clean energy industry study found that 714,257 people in 12 Midwestern states work in renewable energy generation, clean transmission, energy efficiency, clean fuels and advanced transportation. Some 108,000 in Ohio alone do, compared with 38,000 in the coal, oil and gas fields. The Democratic message could start with some simple math: There are currently 7.6 billion people on the planet, and in 2030 there will be 8.6 billion — another one billion in just over a decade! If even half of them get cars, have air-conditioners and eat high-protein diets like Americans now do, we will devour and burn up the planet beyond recognition. So what does that mean? It means clean energy and efficiency have to be the next great global industry or we’re going to be a bad biological experiment, whether there is climate change or not. Does anyone — other than Trump — believe that America can continue to dominate the world economy and not lead the next great global industry, but leave that to China? The Democratic strategy should be built around putting together the performance standards, research and carbon pricing to achieve what Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey calls “the four zeros.” These are, Harvey explains: 1. “A zero-carbon grid. Right now, Republican states like Texas and Wyoming dominate the U.S. wind industry and are reaping most of the jobs and environmental benefits. That should go national. 2. Zero-emission vehicles. When you combine a zero-carbon grid with electric vehicles, bingo, you have zero-carbon transportation. 3. Zero-net energy buildings. What if you could build a well-insulated home, put today’s inexpensive solar panels on the roof and, over the course of a year, produce as much energy as you consume? Fantastical? No. It’s now the law in Santa Monica, and getting most of the way there is already feasible — and cost-effective — throughout the country. 4. Zero-waste manufacturing. New techniques in manufacturing, such as 3-D printing or advanced chemistry, can slash waste — and waste is a tax on both the budget and the earth.” Now that’s a platform worth running on, and it’s one that can do what Democrats need most: make them the party of strengthening the working class and American security. Clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing and efficient buildings make everything we want to achieve in our society easier. They can lower our health care costs, lower heating bills for the poor, drive 21st-century innovation, foster decent jobs, mitigate climate change, create more competitive export industries, weaken petro-dictators — and enhance U.S. national security and moral leadership. Let Trump fight that idea. If Mother Nature keeps on this destructive track into 2020, well, Trump’s favorite mantra about strong women, “lock her up,” will look awfully silly.

Alex Cranz,"If the last week has led you to be wary of having an Intel CPU powering your PC then you might want to get excited, because it seems like AMD might have started actually making CPUs you’d want instead of having Intel inside. It started last year with the announcement of Ryzen desktop CPUs. We found them to be cheaper and faster than comparably priced CPUs from Intel. Then late in the fall AMD announced a new line of mobile-based APUs —which is what they call their CPUs with integrated graphics. The new Ryzen APUs used the same Vega architecture found in AMD’s exceptional and affordable desktop GPUs. AMD then got a lot more appealing over the last week, when a security vulnerability was found in a wide range of computer processors (including AMD’s). Intel is grossly affected by the vulnerability and has already been hit with a number of class action complaints regarding the vulnerability and the necessary hampering of CPUs in order to resolve it, but AMD has repeatedly claimed that it is significantly less affected. It is, according to AMD and computer luminaries like Linux creator Linus Torvald, simply more secure. And now there are more AMD CPUs to choose from than in years. Today AMD announced three new 15 Watt APUs for pro customers: The Ryzen 7 Pro 2700U, Ryzen 5 Pro 2500U, and Ryzen 3 Pro 2300U. 15W processors are the ones found in ultralight laptops, like your Dell XPS 13, Lenovo 720, your Asus Zenbook 3—though the Pro processors are likely to be found in more enterprise-like laptops like the Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad line ups. For people who don’t want the additional security features of the Pro line there are still the regular 15W Ryzen APUs, and besides the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 in that class AMD announced two Ryzen 3 APUs today: The Ryzen 3 2300U and Ryzen 3 2200U. The Ryzen 3 APUs are positioned to compete with Intel’s 15W i3 processors. Which means they’re likely to be found in the cheaper laptops made by manufacturers, and once upon a time that would have been a very expected and not very good thing for AMD. Traditionally, the company has sold cheaper CPUs that use more energy, so you’d find them in huge, cheap eyesore laptops built by OEMs (those are the computer makers). Mindful of that fact, AMD has designed its new Ryzen APUs so that their performance is, at least, partially tied to the design of the laptop. It’s due to an automated overclocking feature called Mobile Extended Frequency Ranger (XFR). The better the thermal design of the laptop, the faster and more energy efficient the processor. But AMD doesn’t just want to be in the cheap laptops that were once it’s bread and butter. It strongly feels its latest processors are more than capable of competing with Intel, and now it has to convince not just consumers, but computers makers as well. “The excuse the OEMs would always give is ‘but you’re not competing with an i7 or an i5 in terms of performance’,” Jim Anderson, Senior Vice President and General Manger of the Computing and Graphics Business Group at AMD, told Gizmodo. He was explaining why AMD APUs never appeared in the laptops of the same class and quality as those found with Intel inside. “But,” Anderson continued “we certainly are now.” Bragging about AMD’s line up of APUs, which have only just begun to roll out in laptops available to consumers and the press, Anderson said “As more and more Ryzen systems come to market you will see the best range of premium notebooks that you’ve ever seen from AMD.” In our conversation, Anderson seemed positively giddy over AMD’s plans for the coming year. Besides the Ryzen Pro line and two Ryzen 3 APUs, there’s also the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 APU currently available, and today AMD also announced two desktop APUs available February 12: The $170 Ryzen 5 2400G and the $100 Ryzen 3 2200G. These processors, according to AMD, are faster (and way cheaper) than the comparable desktop processors from Intel: the $200 Intel i5-8500 and the $130 Intel i3-8100 respectively. In fact the Ryzen 5 2400G, according to AMD, is so fast it can handle top tier games like Battlefield 1 and Witcher 3, at playable frame rates, without a video card. That’s simply not possible with the current generation of Intel CPUs. The graphics aren’t insane—AMD compares the Ryzen 5 2400G’s GPU performance to the $75 Nvidia 1030—but the graphics, at that price, certainly seems crazy good if AMD’s benchmarks are to be believed. And it’s difficult not to be delighted at AMD also continuing to use the nearly 18-month old AM4 socket for these processors to connect to the motherboard. That’s the same socket used with chips from AMD’s last microarchitecture, Excavator, as well as all currently available Ryzen processors, and the many Ryzen processors expected over the next handful of years. According to Anderson, AMD is devoted to the AM4 socket and doesn’t want to force people to upgrade their motherboard every few years, as is currently necessary with Intel’s processors. “We’re going to stick with AM4 for a long time,” he told Gizmodo. And that means that the second generation of Ryzen CPUs, which Anderson also mentioned today, will work with the AM4 socket as well. These processors, which are expected in the second quarter of 2018, are part of AMD’s super aggressive attempt to chip away at Intel’s hold on the CPU market. AMD didn’t go into too much detail, but did say the 2nd-Gen Ryzen processors would operate on a new Zen+ microarchitecture and that it would shrink from the 14nm that Zen is on, to 12nm. That’s a 2nm difference in just one year! Intel, for comparison, introduced its first 14nm processor in 2014, and it has repeatedly delayed moving to something smaller. Moreover, AMD has even claimed it will have a 7nm processor, the Zen 2, ready for market in 2020. That’s a crazy rapid pace of development for a company that’s spent the better part of the last five years completely stagnant. And it’s crazy exciting for consumers, because, as Jim Anderson repeatedly noted in his conversation with Gizmodo, AMD is finally able to compete with Intel. It’s not the slow and cheap alternative. It’s, potentially, the faster and cheaper alternative. Which means, if Intel, who is already hurting from this security snafu, doesn’t want to find itself playing second fiddle, it will need to step up its game, because if the performance of these new Ryzen processors are as good as AMD claims than I know I’ll be seriously considering a switch.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright DigitalGlobe Image caption Satellite images appear to show evidence of a submarine-launched missile programme North Korea is on ""an aggressive schedule to build and deploy its first operational ballistic missile submarine"", according to an analysis of new satellite images by the expert website 38 North. The images represent a powerful reminder that, as well as developing inter-continental range ballistic missiles launched from land, North Korea has for several years been pursuing a programme to launch a long-range missile from a submarine. It already has a prototype sub and a submersible launching barge, from which it has carried out a number of test firings. But the new images show that significant work is under way at the Sinpo shipyard on North Korea's eastern coast to expand its construction facilities, and there are hints that another missile-carrying submarine may be under construction. The imagery shows two large circular objects that could be sections of a submarine's pressure hull. Size estimates suggest the objects could be for a follow on vessel to the existing prototype SINPO-class boat. Satellite images show a continued movement throughout 2017 of parts and components into and out of yards adjacent to the shipyard's large construction halls. Gantry and tower cranes have been regularly moved, all suggesting a ""prolonged and active ship-building programme"", according to 38 North. Image copyright DigitalGlobe Image caption 2 Work has also been under way at a missile test stand that is apparently used to replicate the ejection of a missile from a submarine's hull. From satellite images alone it is difficult to assess how much progress North Korea's submarine-launched missile programme has made. But Mark Fitzpatrick, a veteran arms control expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the BBC that submarine-launched missiles would give North Korea a second-strike capability if it faced an attack intended to take out its nuclear forces. Mr Fitzpatrick also noted that ""up to now, North Korea has frequently surprised analysts and exceeded expectations in terms of the pace of its missile development"". Firing a missile from a submerged submarine poses very particular challenges. So far, the North Korea has only used a submersible testing barge, and its sea-borne missile programme remains far from operational. But the programme is a measure of Pyongyang's strategic ambitions, and another indication that it is unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal any time soon.

DANA GOLDSTEIN,"In Arizona, teachers clad in red, the color of the teacher protest movement, have conducted a series of #RedforEd demonstrations demanding higher pay. In Kentucky, teachers have organized rallies to protest proposed cuts to their pensions. And in Oklahoma, where teachers have not had a raise from the state in a decade, they have vowed to go on strike on April 2 if the Legislature does not act to increase pay and education budgets. Photo Left, Tiffany Bell, a teacher at Hamilton Elementary School in Tulsa; right, Becky Atherton Dukes of Carnegie Elementary in Tulsa. Many teachers in Oklahoma believe there is little hope of avoiding the walkout. Credit Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times All three states are paragons of austerity budgeting, guided by a belief that taxes should be as low as possible to encourage people to spend more and companies to move there and grow. But one result has been a cutback in education, a sector in which a large and popular work force is finding it has labor muscles to flex after all. “We are hemorrhaging from a lack of funding,” said Larry Cagle, a Tulsa teacher and organizer of one of several Facebook groups pushing for a walkout. “If I get fired, I get fired. I will absolutely not back down.” Oklahomans are not always averse to paying more for education. Local districts can use property taxes and bonds to pay for facilities, and many of the school buildings themselves are beautiful. Webster Middle and High School in Tulsa is a pristinely maintained Art Deco castle. In 2015, Tulsa voters passed a $415 million bond to invest in technology and the district’s physical infrastructure. But most instructional costs are covered by the state, where laws and politics make it difficult to raise taxes. And it is inside the classroom that students and parents have noticed the impact of depressed state budgets. Webster, where 88 percent of students come from low-income families, has cut its advanced foreign language courses, along with classes in drama and debate. Six miles away, Carver Middle School has rationed paper and there are not enough parts to go around in robotics class, students said. About a fifth of Oklahoma school districts, mostly in rural areas, are trying an even more drastic way to save money: a four-day week. (They cannot cut the number of instructional hours, so the school days tend to be longer.) Across the state, teachers say they make ends meet by selling their blood plasma, or by working second jobs as luggage handlers, Uber drivers or in lawn maintenance.

Credit Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times When teachers here last went on strike, in 1990 for four days, they won a raise and limitations on class sizes. But that was the last time the Oklahoma Legislature raised taxes. In 1992, anti-tax activists successfully organized a ballot referendum to require a three-quarters majority in both the state House and Senate to raise new revenue and today, Oklahoma is one of 13 states that require a supermajority to impose new taxes. Research has found little direct relationship between tax cuts and indicators like job creation. Oklahoma’s economy did well between 2001 and 2014, in part because of a boom in oil and gas. More recently, the state’s economy slowed along with a decrease in oil prices. But ever since the referendum passed, it has become an insurmountable barrier for attempts to increase school spending. The 1990 class size reductions were scrapped for lack of funds. Since 2008, Oklahoma has cut its per-pupil instructional funding by 28 percent — the largest cut in the nation, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank. The current budget situation is so dire that some superintendents and school boards are supporting, and even helping to organize, the proposed teacher walkout. Deborah Gist, who as the hard-charging education commissioner in Rhode Island tried to weaken teachers’ seniority protections and often clashed with their union, is now Tulsa’s schools superintendent and is allied with the Oklahoma union — the Oklahoma Education Association — in a fight for more money. Dr. Gist said she is unable to attract or retain effective educators because they can earn up to $20,000 more per year by moving to Texas or other neighboring states. Because so few licensed teachers are applying for jobs, Tulsa has relied on emergency certifications to hire more than 100 teachers who lack training in education. “Our teachers in Oklahoma are going above and beyond every single day for an unacceptable and unsustainable salary that doesn’t even provide them with a living wage,” she said.

Ms. Vasquez supports the teachers’ plan for a strike, though she is worried that her husband, a school bus driver, will be out of work. Credit Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times Teachers in Oklahoma earn $45,000 a year on average, the third-lowest in the country; only those in Mississippi and South Dakota earn less, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. They are doing better, though, than many workers in Oklahoma, which has the third-lowest cost of living and where the average teacher salary is about equal to the median household income. But teachers, especially those in their 20s and 30s, say they live paycheck to paycheck anyhow, without the middle-class stability they expected when they chose teaching as a career, often taking on student debt along the way. Becky Atherton Dukes, an art teacher at Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa, pays $400 per month for health insurance for herself and her daughter. She and her husband, a house painter, are expecting a second child, and their day care costs will exceed Ms. Dukes’s pay. “I love my job,” she said. “But it would be nice to be able to afford a family vacation or have money for savings.” Most here believe there is little hope of avoiding the walkout. In 2016, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have increased education funding through an additional one percent sales tax. More recently, a legislative proposal called Step Up Oklahoma would have funded $5,000 raises by increasing gas and tobacco taxes and modestly raising production taxes on the energy industry. It was supported by Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, the teachers union and a coalition of business leaders. On Feb. 12, 63 members of the state House of Representatives voted for it, and 35 against, short of the required 75 percent supermajority. A quarter of Republicans and more than two-thirds of Democrats opposed the bill. The Platform Caucus, a group of Republican opponents, issued a statement saying the tax increases would have undone the benefits of President Trump’s tax cuts. “It is unfortunate that lawmakers and special interests are so quick to try and grab that money,” the caucus wrote. Democratic opponents said the plan was too easy on oil and gas, while raising taxes too high on the wind industry. They also asked for an increase in income taxes on high earners. Photo Like many administrators, Tera Carr, the Hamilton Elementary School principal, has shown solidarity with the teachers’ union. Credit Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York Times Moderate Republicans say colleagues further to the right are wedded to an ideology that no longer makes sense. “They just won’t raise taxes,” said Representative Earl Sears, a retired principal and the chairman of the House appropriations committee. “We’re at the point where we’ve cut so much, we now have to go in and make investments. If that means raising taxes, so be it.” Mr. Sears also accused Democrats of wanting the schools crisis to continue, so they could run on the issue in future elections. “They really don’t want to give the Republican Party a victory,” he said. Indeed, anger about education cuts has helped fuel something of a blue ripple in this Republican-dominated state, with Democrats flipping four legislative seats in special elections in 2017. After the defeat of the bill, educators began to gather on Facebook and in person to share their frustration. Rank-and-file teachers pushed their union to support their demand that the state act before April 2 or face a work stoppage. The Oklahoma Education Association is now asking for a $10,000 raise for teachers, a $5,000 raise for school support staff and a $200 million increase in schools funding. On March 12, Oklahoma teachers took their first steps toward a strike, beginning a “work to contract” protest in which teachers marched out of their schools when the last bell rang. They refused to tutor students, email with parents or grade papers after hours. At Carver Middle School on Tuesday, students applauded as their teachers filed out of the building. At Carnegie Elementary School, Ms. Dukes reluctantly canceled her students’ annual art show. In preparation, she had meticulously organized and labeled every pinch pot and collage in her classroom. But bringing the event to fruition would have required logging long hours after school and at home, work that she believes entitles her to a raise. One of her colleagues, she said, had moved away from Oklahoma, and now earns the equivalent of $85,000 per year as a teacher. Ms. Dukes laughed. “To get her American dream,” she said, “she had to move to China.” Continue reading the main story",Students leaving Carver Middle School in Tulsa last week.

Quentyn Kennemer,"Battlefield fans rejoice: the series is returning to World War 2, but this time with the power of the Frostbite engine behind it. This should make for the most realistic and action-packed World War 2 multiplayer shooter we've ever seen. Everything you need to know about Battlefield V is straight ahead. What is Battlefield V? We weren't sure which direction DICE would go with Battlefield V after the previous entry - Battlefield 1 - took the series back to its World War 1 roots. With a new mainline entry, we thought the company might look to go with a more modern approach or go a completely different direction with a war they have yet to explore, but it appears they were eager to apply their World War 2 expertise to the new Frostbite engine. Battlefield V will be a familiar game in that regard. It'll be a beautiful first-person shooter that should capture that old wartime feeling like no other. The game will be all about multiplayer, but there's still a bit of fun to be had for those who aren't in it for the competitiveness. Single Player With Battlefield 1, DICE tried something a bit different with their single-player component. Instead of a single lengthy campaign that follows one story that retells the same iconic battles that have been told 100 times, it focused on smaller multiple stories, ones which don't often get the same kind of attention as, say, the D-Day landings in World War 2. Expect that to continue in Battlefield V. We're not yet sure which stories will be told, but if Battlefield 1 is anything to go by then we know they'll often follow individual soldiers or smaller brigades. DICE is likely to use each individual campaign as an opportunity to deliver vastly different gameplay experiences. One might have you marching on the frontlines to storm an enemy foothold, while you might be taking to the skies to dogfight in another. We're also getting a cooperative mode called Combined Arms, a separate set of stories designed to be played with up to four people. Multiplayer As you'd expect, multiplayer will be the bread and butter of Battlefield V. There aren't many games that deliver the level of large-scale that these games do while maintaining a high level of immersion. In typical Battlefield fashion, a mix of infantry and vehicular combat will make for unpredictable and exciting matches. It'll have all the staple elements of the series, including massive maps, tons of players, and destructible environments. You'll do battle on a variety of game modes, including Domination, Conquest, Frontlines, Team Deathmatch and Breakthrough. Grand Operations, an epic, large-scale warfare mode, also returns. Our own Reb Valentine spent time with the mode at E3 2018. As she describes it: Grand Operations is a massive battle that takes place over three days. Your team's success, either as attackers or defenders, will determine your resources on subsequent days, such as troops, ammo, and medkits. On the final day, no one is able to respawn, allowing the fight to determine the ultimate victor of the battle. Battlefield V: Everything you need to know about Grand Operations Fans of Battle Royale games like Fortnite and PUBG will be happy to learn that Battlefield V will have a Royale mode of its own. We're told to expect all the classic tropes of the genre, but with all the stuff that makes Battlefield special. While multiplayer elements mostly remain unchanged - you defend or capture some sort of objective, or simply aim to kill everyone in sight - there is one new mechanic worth pointing out. You can now build fortifications such as trenches, sandbag walls, and barbed wire hazards. Another change is that the revive mechanic can now be used by any class, and you can drag your teammates to safety before going to revive them. Class changes A big part of Battlefield are the various classes you can play as in the game. You have Assault, Medic, Support, and Sniper. The Support player specializes in building fortifications, repairing vehicles, and supplying ammo to teammates. In previous games, the ammo supply mechanic wasn't handy for anything other than replenishing your explosives, as firearm rounds were plentiful. DICE is looking to lessen the amount of starting ammo you get to make the class more meaningful (though players can also pick up extra ammo off of fallen enemies and comrades). You'll be able to build advanced fortifications that other classes can't, such as a machine gun nest. Medics are still focused on healing or reviving allies. Any player can revive a teammate, sure, but that teammate has to be in your squad, and they'll only get a partial health pool on recovery. Only the medic can revive or heal a teammate to full health using their medkit. Their healing action will also be faster, giving you an excellent reason to play the role if you want to keep your squad healthy. DICE hasn't detailed changes to the other two classes, but Snipers are typically only focused on picking off foes from afar and will have a range of tools to keep them safe wherever they decide to hole up. The Assault class, meanwhile, will provide the best balance of firepower and utility. You can customize classes by changing your exact gear, guns, loadouts, and attachments, but there are also new cosmetic customization options that'll let you stand out even more. You can now change your gender, race, add face paint, change clothing, and use cool new headgear. You can also give your vehicles a different look with skins and modifications. Free DLC Battlefield V will have free post-launch DLC, DICE has confirmed. That means new maps and modes will be accessible to all players without the need to buy them individually or buy a season pass. This is a great move that will solve the issue of community fragmentation. DICE plans to make up for the money lost through battle packs, which is their cute name for loot boxes. These should only offer cosmetics for the class customization options mentioned above. Where to pre-order Pre-ordering Battlefield V? You can get an exclusive in-game outfit, special assignments, and five weapons to use right now in Battlefield 1, and if you pre-order early enough, you'll be able to get in on the Battlefield V beta earlier than anyone else.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"A class-action lawsuit filed against several U.S. government officials claims a newly updated policy expanding the collection of biometric and biographical data is unjustly resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of unaccompanied immigrant children and potentially aiding immigration enforcement agencies in the capture of other individuals. The lawsuit specifically addresses an Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) policy that requires all adults living in the same household as a family member who’s sponsoring a detained child to turn over biometric and biographical data, including fingerprints and sometimes photographs. The complaint seeks, in part, to find out whether this data collection is “arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law” under the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit was filed by the Legal Aid Justice Center on behalf of all children currently or subsequently in the custody of the ORR or the state of Virginia from July 20, 2017, onward. The class action also applies to anyone who applied to be a sponsor of a detained child but did not give up the biometric data of every adult in their household, resulting in the child’s continued detainment. In April, Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Scott Lloyd, the director of ORR, signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customers Enforcement to, as the lawsuit describes it, “vastly expand” what information sponsors and other adults living in their households must hand over—information that could be shared among the agencies. Both Wagner and Lloyd are listed as defendants in the lawsuit along with ORR Deputy Director Jonathan White, HHS Secretary Alex Azar, and a federal field specialist at ORR, Natasha David. In response to Gizmodo’s request for comment, an HHS spokesperson directed us to section 2 of ORR’s policy regarding children who enter the U.S. unaccompanied by an adult. The section, which was updated on June 7, states in part: “ORR denies release when an adult household member refuses to have a background check.” ICE and CBP declined to comment and instead directed Gizmodo to contact HHS. Because of this new intrusive policy—requiring all adults in a sponsor’s home to give up their biometric and biographical data—a minor currently detained in a high-security facility is unable to reunite with his family because other adults in their sponsor’s household are afraid to share this type of information with the agencies, the lawsuit asserts. “Caregivers at risk of detention or deportation are forced to choose between getting their child released from ORR custody and their own ability to remain out of detention and in the country to provide care [for] their children,” the lawsuit states. The biometric data collected includes fingerprints and sometimes photos, while the biographic data includes basic info such as their name, age, date of birth, and address, Legal Aid Justice Center attorney Rebecca Ruth Wolozin told Gizmodo in an email. She characterizes this policy as “more intrusive than what ORR has done in the past,” and said that there is “no precedent for a policy of vast information collection and sharing like this.” She also noted that there’s no requirement or indication of “probable cause” that would necessitate such a policy. The plaintiffs argue that this policy violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Due Process Clause. An unnamed boy identified as the lead petitioner on the suit has been in ORR custody for almost five months even though his brother-in-law has applied to be his sponsor and provided the program with his biometric and biographical data, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also claims that he has been close with his brother-in-law since he was a toddler, and spoke with him and his sister on the phone regularly before coming to the United States. The child’s “prolonged imprisonment at a young age, and his inability to be with his family has caused him significant anxiety and sadness,” the lawsuit states. “He often cries when speaking to family members on the phone and is struggling to cope with the daily bullying he experiences at” the detention center. “Since being placed in these centers, [MINOR’S NAME] has fought episodes of depression, despair, and fear,” the lawsuit adds. “The conditions of this unnecessary confinement, the high level of security of these facilities, and Defendants’ dilatory approach to reunification have combined into a psychological assault that has repeatedly tested an already traumatized child, and which has only further complicated [MINOR’S NAME]’s release. And unfortunately, [MINOR’S NAME]’s experience is not unique.” On Tuesday, Matthew Albence, ICE’s head of enforcement and removal operations, described the immigration detention facilities as “ more like a summer camp than a jail. ” It’s a breathtakingly tone-deaf remark amid numerous reports suggesting otherwise. The Trump administration’s policy to separate migrant children from their parents itself was deemed “ a form of child abuse ” by healthcare professionals. The facilities have come under fire after reports of neglect, sexual abuse, and overall traumatic circumstances. A Reveal report from June alleged that immigrant children at a facility in Texas were forced to take psychiatric drugs. And the American Immigration Lawyers Association said on Wednesday that a migrant child died soon after leaving an ICE detention facility in Texas. This new policy from ORR only stands to create yet another obstacle between detained children and a loving support system. It effectively turns a child into bait, pinning their reunification with a loved one on all adults in that household—adults who may understandably be fearful of how the agencies might use their sensitive information.",A class-action lawsuit filed against several U.S. government officials claims a newly updated policy expanding the collection of biometric and biographical data is unjustly resulting in the prolonged imprisonment of unaccompanied immigrant children and potent…,2018-08-01T21:33:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Lawsuit: Sweeping Biometric Data Collection Keeps Immigrant Children Locked Up Longer,https://gizmodo.com/lawsuit-sweeping-biometric-data-collection-keeps-immig-1828027254,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--H2HQSgHl--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/lwlvczxm66imrtxbdirf.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,class-2,1
Sarah Perez,"As promised last year, CBS today launched its own sports news network, CBS Sports HQ, which will offer 24-hour streaming coverage of news, highlights and analysis for free online, via connected devices, and within the company’s over-the-top streaming service, CBS All Access. The network had originally said its plan for the sports streaming service was to replicate the success it found with its streaming news network, CBSN, which launched in 2014 to bring CBS news content to digital platforms. That network grew to 287 million streams in 2017, up 17 percent over 2016 – which was an Election year, CBS notes. Similarly, CBS Sports HQ will stream for free, 24/7, and work across a range of devices at launch, including smartphones and tablets (iOS and Android), connected TVs (Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Roku), all via the CBS Sports app, as well as online at CBSSports.com/live. The service will also be available to subscribers of CBS All Access, home to CBS programming and original content like “Star Trek: Discovery,” which works across mobile, tablet, web, and TV platforms, too. The new sports network itself will take advantage of resources CBS already has in place, like CBS Sports, CBSSports.com, 247Sports, SportsLine, CBS Sports Fantasy and MaxPreps. It will combine live news and reporting with game previews, post-game analysis, highlights, projects, and statistical breakdowns, the company says. In addition, a DVR-like feature will allow viewers to go back and watch previously recorded segments. The service is meant, in particular, to attract younger viewers who no longer watch traditional television – either because they’ve cancelled their pay TV subscriptions, or because they’ve never signed up in the first place. This demographic tends to watch programming online, through a combination of YouTube, on-demand subscription services like Netflix, or over-the-top live TV services like Sling TV, Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV and others. CBS today has offerings in both categories, to some extent. With CBS All Access, for example, it provides on-demand programming as well as a live stream of users’ local CBS station. Meanwhile, CBSN offers live, streaming news 24 hours a day. Both Showtime and CBS All Access hit over 2 million subscribers by year-end, exceeding the company’s forecast goals. CBS expects those will reach 8 million subscribers by 2020. “CBS Sports HQ is another key step in the evolution of the CBS Corporation,” said Leslie Moonves, CBS Chairman and CEO, in a statement about the launch. “From CBS All Access to Showtime OTT to CBSN, we are creating best-in-class direct-to-consumer streaming platforms that are positioning us to be leaders in the future of premium content distribution. Thanks to the collaboration of CBS Interactive and CBS Sports, I am confident that CBS Sports HQ will become our latest success story in that regard.”","As promised last year, CBS today launched its own sports news network, CBS Sports HQ, which will offer 24-hour streaming coverage of news, highlights and analysis for free online, via connected devices, and within the company’s over-the-top streaming service,…",2018-02-26T14:53:38Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","CBS launches a 24/7 streaming sports news network, CBS Sports HQ",http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/26/cbs-launches-a-24-7-streaming-sports-news-network-cbs-sports-hq/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-26-at-9-46-47-am.png,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-2,1

nigelroberts1,"I t shouldn’t come as a shock that the intern staff working in the White House is practically all White. The racial composition of the class is a repeat of last year, and 2019 will probably be the same. SEE ALSO: Trump Administration: ‘Black People Need Not Apply’ Many people are criticizing the Trump administration for selecting a spring intern class of 91 participants that includes just a handful of non-Whites. That was expected from an administration that does not value diversity. Still, when the White House released the class photograph on Friday, scores of people took to social media to vent. “The White House intern photo is like a Where’s Waldo for a non-white person—in a country that is about 40% non-white,” tweeted political scientist and Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas. Although it’s obvious to just about everyone, the White House denies publicly that it has a diversity problem. Back in December, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was dishonest when she said the administration has “a really diverse team across the board,” when asked how many senior Black staffers work for the White House. More recently, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came under fire when three senior Interior Department officials alleged that he said several times “diversity isn’t important,” or “I don’t care about diversity,” or “I don’t really think that’s important anymore.” White House staff became notably whiter after the departure of Omarosa Manigualt Newman in December. She was “the only African-American woman who sits at the table,” Newman highlighted to NBC News. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is the only Black voice in Trump’s cabinet. The African-American Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who holds a senior level position in the administration, is also a visible presence.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Everyone from Margot Robbie to Mary J Blige gathered in Los Angeles on Monday for the traditional Oscars ""class photo"". This year's Academy Awards contenders rubbed shoulders at the annual nominees' luncheon, which took place four weeks before they will regroup for ceremony itself. While the catering team at the Academy are probably getting sick of the sight of Meryl Streep, we certainly aren't. And nor do we ever tire of the irregularities and intriguing outfits which are always provided by the class photo. Here are 11 things we spotted this year. (Fortunately, Vanity Fair's Photoshop editor wasn't there to help so this is one Hollywood photo where nobody was given an extra leg.) 1. Firstly, is that... a cardboard cut-out? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes, yes it is. At 89 years old, Agnes Varda has already become the oldest nominee in Oscars history. The Belgian-born director is nominated in the best documentary film category for Visages Villages [Faces Places]. Sadly, Agnes couldn't make it to the luncheon in person. So her co-director JR held up a cardboard cut-out of her instead. We don't know why nobody has thought of this before - just think of all the weddings she must get out of attending. (Actually, does anybody know where you order one of these?) 2. Hey look it's Mitzeee from Hollyoaks Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk We don't often use the words ""Hollyoaks"" and ""Oscars"" in the same sentence. But, there she is, third row from the front and fourth from the right: Rachel Shenton. The Silent Child, written by Shenton and directed by another former Hollyoaks actor, Chris Overton, is nominated for best live action short film. ""I don't class myself as a writer so I felt grossly underqualified doing this,"" she said last month. But she certainly isn't out of place in this year's class photo. 3. This chap has been going to the gym and he'd like you to know about it Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk ""Oh this? Oh it's just my bicep. I'd totally forgotten it was there! Goodness gracious, what am I like, eh?"" That's Dunkirk cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema in the back row. 4. Eric Fellner would make a poor spy Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk The co-chairman of Working Title films might have managed to stay behind the scenes as a producer of Victoria &amp; Abdul but had less success going undetected here, peering out from behind the giant statuette. Of course, he may have been placed there deliberately given his uncanny resemblance to Oscar himself. 5. Basketball injuries went unnoticed Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's Common in the back row, nominated for best original song alongside Diane Warren for Stand Up For Something from the film Marshall. The rapper was looking so dapper you probably wouldn't notice he was actually trying to hide a black eye. He wore a pair of glasses in the hope of trying to hide the bruise he sustained after a basketball mishap at the weekend. 6. Not everybody was successful in looking at the camera Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's always one. Or, in this case, two. We've all been Mudbound director Dee Rees at some point and managed to blink at the precise moment a photo is being taken. (Although in our case it only affects our 62 Instagram followers rather than the millions of people that will see an iconic and significant piece of film history.) Sam Rockwell did keep his eyes open, but smiling and looking at the camera proved too much. 7. People in Los Angeles really need to stop using Justin Timberlake's tailor Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk After last year's trouser-gate, we really thought 2018 would be different. Not only is Raphael Saadiq sporting a rather brave beige trousers/grey socks combo, but the tailor had clearly run out of fabric by the time the music producer got round to ordering an outfit. WHEN WILL THEY LEARN? *shakes fist* 8. It wasn't all grey Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk In a sea of dull suits and generic ties, a few brave souls stood out from the crowd with a splash of colour. We particularly salute make-up artist Daniel Phillips, Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan and The Big Sick writer Emily V Gordon. We don't care if they don't win any actual trophies - they have already won this year's photo. 9. Quite a lot of men aren't there? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes. 126 to be precise. With 46 women. (And one of them is a cardboard cut-out.) It's an issue Academy president John Bailey is aware of, making reference to the gender imbalance when he spoke at the luncheon. ""The Academy is at a crossroads of change,"" he said. ""We are witnessing this motion picture academy reinvent itself in front of our very eyes, and a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."" 10. Kobe Bryant is sitting down Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Which is a very sensible idea, given that he's six-and-a-half feet tall. Had he been allowed to stand up, he certainly would have obscured Breadwinner director Nora Twomey and make-up artist David Malinowski at the very least, who were right behind him. They probably could have sat him on the floor and he'd still tower over half the people there. 11. But which nominees are missing from this photo? Image copyright Getty / PA Well, Daniel Day-Lewis is absent, because of course he is. (Possibly because he was busy ordering a bigger trophy cabinet from Ikea.) He wasn't the only Phantom Thread star who didn't make it though - best supporting actress nominee Lesley Manville is nowhere to be seen either. Elsewhere, Christopher Plummer was also absent from the luncheon, although he could probably be edited in later. Denzel Washington and Woody Harrelson, nominated in the best actor and supporting actor categories respectively, also sent their apologies. Perhaps one of the most notable absentees is best actress favourite Frances McDormand, who's nominated for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Bonus: The 'alternative' picture Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk As is tradition, the photographer also took a ""fun"" version of the photo, where the nominees were encouraged to pull funny faces or different poses. Several just applauded, others put their thumbs up, but full marks go to Watu Wote: All of Us director Katja Benrath, in the front row, for the slightly-more-original rock on hand sign, and Dear Basketball animator Glen Keane for managing to obscure his own face with his arm while waving from the fifth row.

The Texas Tribune,"Kevin Moloney / Getty Images On Wednesday, advocates for Mexican-American studies won approval to move forward with introducing a state-wide class on the subject. The final vote on the issue is scheduled for Friday. Supporters, however, were not satisfied with the new course name proposed by Beaumont Republican David Bradley, ""Ethnic Studies: An Overview of Americans of Mexican Descent."" Before the vote, Texas teachers could offer Mexican-American studies as a social studies elective, but had to generate coursework and textbooks on their own, making it difficult for smaller school districts to offer the class. Texas advocates for Mexican-American studies classes won a bitter victory Wednesday, gaining approval to move forward with the class they wanted but losing the course title. The State Board of Education had been debating more than four years over how and whether to offer teachers materials and guidance to teach Mexican-American studies. In a preliminary vote, the board voted nearly unanimously to create curriculum standards for the elective class. But now it will be called ""Ethnic Studies: An Overview of Americans of Mexican Descent."" A final vote on the issue is scheduled for Friday. The class will be based on an innovative course Houston Independent School District (ISD) got state approval to offer in 2015. Texas Education Agency staff will make any needed changes to that set of curriculum standards and then bring it back for the first of two public hearings and votes in June. Lawrence Allen Jr., a Houston Democrat, was the only member to vote against the newly named course, expressing support for Mexican-American studies but criticizing the new title. Starting a fierce debate with Democrats on the board, Beaumont Republican David Bradley proposed the new name for the course. When asked why he didn't want to keep ""Mexican-American studies,"" he said, ""I don't subscribe to hyphenated Americanism. … I find hyphenated Americanism to be divisive."" ""As someone who identifies as Mexican-American, your experience is unlike my experience,"" San Antonio Democrat Marisa Perez-Diaz retorted. ""I'm asking you to be inclusive."" Most Democrats, except for El Paso Democrat Georgina Pérez, voted against Bradley's proposal. But they were outnumbered. Standing outside the hearing room to discuss their strategy after the vote, Texas professors and teachers criticized Pérez for voting to strip the Mexican-American studies class of its name and brainstormed future options. ""We can change the name in the public comment phase if enough of you turn out,"" said Brownsville Democrat Ruben Cortez, who represents District 2 on the board and has been spearheading the fight for a Mexican-American studies course for years. Of 38 people who signed up to testify on the issue, 37 noted they were in favor of approving the course. (The one person who signed up in opposition is Friendswood ISD board member Matt Robinson, likely to replace Bradley in January. He did not speak Wednesday.) Even before the vote, Texas teachers could already offer Mexican-American studies as a social studies elective, but they had to put in additional work to build a course structure and choose textbooks. That left smaller school districts facing an uphill climb to get a class started. With little centralized guidance on what to teach in Mexican-American studies, districts currently offer varying versions of the course. Teachers already offering some version of Mexican-American studies shared positive reviews from their students who talked about being thrilled to see themselves reflected in their coursework. They also asked the board to approve a set of centralized standards for how to teach the course so they could spend more time teaching than planning what to teach. ""Students have a lot more freedom when we learn about our culture,"" said Damian Mota, a seventh-grade student at KIPP Camino Academy in San Antonio. ""If you walk into our classroom, you're not going to see a traditional classroom. We are passionate learners who back up our claims."" Teachers and professors who testified cited research showing that students who learn their cultural histories do better academically. ""We're not proposing a supplement to what is already being done,"" said University of Texas at Austin professor Emilio Zamora. ""Research has demonstrated that Mexican-American studies … does improve academic performance."" At the board's first public hearing on the matter in January, some Republican board members pushed back on the idea of an official course. Board member Marty Rowley, an Amarillo Republican, said in January that a Mexican-American studies course could be exclusionary by not focusing on the contribution of ""other Latinos to Texas history or American history."" In 2014, the board rejected a proposal to create an official Mexican-American studies course, with some members arguing that creating a separate class would be racially divisive. Instead, board members voted to put ethnic studies, including Mexican-American, African-American, Asian-American and Native American studies, on a list of social studies textbooks it would ask publishers to develop for Texas schools. Critics of that decision have argued that asking publishers to create books without curriculum standards to reference is ineffectual. They said approving the course first, and the standards to go along with it, would give publishers much needed guidance as well as reassurance that school districts might actually buy their textbooks. The board has twice put out calls for ethnic studies textbooks since 2015 and failed to find Mexican-American studies materials they wanted to approve. Board members also voted Wednesday to create a process for approving other elective courses in ethnic studies. Courses in Native American, Latino, African American and Asian Pacific Islander studies will be considered.

Beth Skwarecki,"Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain. But AIs aren’t all run by mega-corporations and governments; you can download some algorithms and play with them yourself, with often hilarious results. There’s the faux Coachella poster full of fake band names, created by feeding a bunch of real band names into a neural network and asking it to come up with some of its own. There are the recipes created in a similar way, where “barbecue beef” calls for “1 beer - cut into cubes.” And then there’s my favorite, Janelle Shane’s AI-generated paint colors (tag yourself, I’m Dorkwood). Humans aren’t nearly as creative as we think. Craft brewers, for example, have run out of fun names … Read more Read These were all made with neural networks, a type of AI modeled on the network-like nature of our own brains. You train a neural network by giving it input: recipes, for example. The network strengthens some of the connections between its neurons (imitation brain cells) more than others as it learns. The idea is that it’s figuring out the rules of how the input works: which letters tend to follow others, for example. Once the network is trained, you can ask it to generate its own output, or to give it a partial input and ask it to fill in the rest. But the computer doesn’t actually understand the rules of, say, making recipes. It knows that beer can be an ingredient, and that things can be cut into cubes, but nobody has ever told it that beer is not one of those things. The outputs that look almost right, but misunderstand some fundamental rule, are often the most hilarious. I was happy to just watch these antics from afar, until Shane mentioned on Twitter that a middle school coding class had generated better ice cream names than she had. And I thought, if kids can do this, I can do this. How to Train Your First Neural Net I started with the same toolkit Shane used for ice cream flavors: a python module called textgenrnn, by Max Woolf of Buzzfeed. You’ll need a basic knowledge of the command line to work with it, but it works on any system (Mac, Linux, Windows) where you’ve installed the programming language/interpreter python. Before you can train your own neural net, you’ll need some input to start with. The middle school class started with a list of thousands of ice cream flavors, for example. Whatever you choose, you’ll want at least a few hundred examples; thousands would be better. Maybe you’d like to download all your tweets, and ask the network to generate you some new tweets. Or check out Wikipedia’s list of lists of lists for ideas. Whatever you choose, get it into a text file with one item per line. This may take some creative copy-and-paste or spreadsheet work, or if you’re an old hand at coding, you can write some ugly perl scripts to munge the data into submission. I’m an ugly perl script kind of girl, but when I ended up wanting Lifehacker headlines for one of my data sets, I just asked our analytics team for a big list of headlines and they emailed me exactly what I needed. Asking nicely is an underrated coding skill. (If you’d like to feed Lifehacker headlines into your own neural net, here is that list. It’s about 10,000 of them.) Create a folder for your new project, and write two scripts. First, one called train.py: from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn() t.train_from_file(‘input.txt’, num_epochs=5); This script will get the neural net reading your input and thinking about what its rules must be. The script has a couple things you can modify: t = textgenrnn() is fine the first time you run the script, but if you’d like to come back to it later, enter the name of the.hdf5 file that magically appeared in the folder when you ran it. In that case, the line should look like this: t=textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5’) ‘input.txt’ is the name of your file with one headline/recipe/tweet/etc per line. num_epochs is how many times you’d like to process the file. The neural network gets better the longer you let it study, so start with 2 or 5 to see how long that takes, and then go up from there. It takes a while to train the network. If you’re running your scripts on a laptop, one epoch might take 10 or 15 minutes (bigger data sets will take longer). If you have access to a beefy desktop, maybe your or a friend’s gaming computer, things will go faster. If you’ve got a big data set, you may want to ask it for a few dozen or even hundreds of epochs, and let it run overnight. Next, write another script called spit_out_stuff.py (you’re free to give these better names than I did): from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5') t.generate(20, temperature=0.5) This is the fun part! The script above will give you 20 fun new things to look at. The important parts of that last line are: The number of things to generate: here, 20. The temperature, which is like a creativity dial. At 0.1, you’ll get very basic output that’s probably even more boring than what you fed in. At 1.0, the output will get so creative that often what comes out isn’t even real words. You can go higher than 1.0, if you dare. When you ran the training script, you’ll have noticed that it shows you sample output at different temperatures, so you can use that to guide how many epochs you run, and what temperature you’d like to use to generate your final output. Not every idea your neural network comes up with will be comedy gold. You’ll have to pick out the best ones yourself. Here are some of the better Lifehacker headlines that my AI came up with: The Best Way to Make a Baby Laptop How to Survive a Backspace Drinking Game The Best Way to Buy a Job Interview How to Get the Best Bonfire of Your Life With This Handy Graphic How to Make Your Own Podcast Bar How to Get a New iPhone X If You’re an Arduino How to Clean Up Your Own Measurements in a Museum How to Get Started With Your Stories and Anxiety The Best Way to Make Your Own Ink Out of the Winter How to Keep Your Relationship With an Imaginary Concept The Best Way to Make a Perfect Cup of Wine With a Raspberry Pi The Best Way to Eat a Toilet Strawberry How to Get a Better Job on Your Vacation The Best Way to Eat a Stubborn Jar I got these by playing with the temperature and the number of training epochs, and every time I saw something I liked I copied it into a text file of my favorites. I also experimented with the word-by-word version of the algorithm; the scripts above use the default character-by-character model. My final list of headlines includes results from both. If you’re curious about some of the rejects, here’s what I get with a 0.1 temperature: The Best Way to Stay Streaming to Stop More Alternative to Make Your Phone The Best Way to Stream the Best Power When You Don’t Need to Know About the World The Best Way to Stay Started to Stay Started to Your Common Ways to Stop Anyone How to Get the Best Way to See the Best Popular Posts The Best Way to Stay Started to Make Your Phone And if I crank it up to 1.5 (dangerously creative): Remains of the Day: How to Ad-Finger the Unsubual Renew Qakeuage to Travel History, Ovenchime, or “Contreiting Passfled The Risk-Idelecady’t Two-Copyns, Focusing Zoomitas Ifo Went Vape Texts Battery Oro crediblacy Supremee Buldsweoapotties DIY Grilling Can Now Edt My Hises Uniti to Spread Your Words Clearly, human help is needed. Become Your AI’s Buddy Even though neural nets can learn from data sets, they don’t truly understand what’s going on. That’s why some of the best results come from partnerships between people and machines. “I know it is a tool that I use,” says Janelle Shane, “but it is hard not to think of it as—‘come on little neural network, you can do it’ and ‘Oh, that was clever’ or ‘You’re getting confused, poor little thing.’ To make the most of your relationship, you’ll have to guide your AI buddy. Sometimes it might get so good at guessing the rules of your data set that it just recreates the same things you fed it—the AI version of plagiarism. You’ll have to check that its funny output is truly original. Botnik studios pairs people with machines by training predictive-text keyboards. Imagine if you picked up your friend’s phone, and typed messages by just using the predictive text on their keyboard. You’d end up writing your own message, but in a style that reads like your friend’s. In the same way, you can train a Botnik keyboard with any data source you’d like, and then write with the words supplied by the keyboard. That’s where this amazing advice column duel came from: two Botnik keyboards trained on Savage Love and Dear Abby. If you’d prefer to work against, rather than with, your algorithmic buddy, check out how Janelle Shane pranked a neural net that at first appeared to be good at recognizing sheep grazing in a meadow. She photoshopped out the sheep, and realized the AI was just looking for white blobs in grass. If she colored the sheep orange, the AI thought they were flowers. So she asked her Twitter followers for sheep in unusual places and found that the AI thinks a sheep in a car must be a dog, goats in a tree must be birds, and a sheep in a kitchen must be a cat. Serious AIs can have similar problems, and playing with algorithms for fun can help us understand why they’re so error-prone. For example, one early skin-cancer-detecting AI accidentally learned the wrong rules for telling the difference between cancerous and benign skin lesions. When a doctor finds a large lesion, they often photograph it next to a ruler to show the size. The AI accidentally taught itself that it’s easy to spot cancerous tumors: just look for rulers. Another lesson we can learn is that an algorithm’s output is only as good as the data you feed in. ProPublica found that one algorithm used in sentencing was harsher on black defendants than white ones. It didn’t consider race as a factor, but its input led it to believe, incorrectly, that the crimes and backgrounds common to black defendants were stronger predictors of repeat offenses than the crimes and backgrounds associated with white defendants. This computer had no idea of the concept of race, but if your input data reflects a bias, the computer can end up perpetuating that bias. It’s best that we understand this limitation of algorithms, and not assume that because they aren’t human they must be impartial. (Good luck with your hate speech AI, Facebook!) Mix Up Your Data Sets There’s no need to stop at one data set; you can mix up two of them and see what results. (I combined the product listings from the Goop and Infowars stores, for example. Slightly NSFW.) You can also train a classifying algorithm. Shane says she already had a list of metal bands and a list of My Little Pony names, so she trained a classifier to tell the difference. (Pinky Doom: 99 percent metal.) Once you have a classifier trained, you can feed anything into it and get a reading. Benedict Cumberbatch: 96 percent metal. You can also feed anything you like into a trained textgenrnn network. When you specify how many items you want and what temperature (creativity) the network should use, you can also give it a prefix. It will then try to come up with words that should follow that prefix. After I trained the Lifehacker headlines, I asked the AI to give me headlines beginning with “3 Ingredient Happy Hour.” It responded with some wonderful fictional cocktails (again, these are my picks out of a longer list): 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Herb Stressful Upgrade 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Cake’s Strawbreak 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Darkled Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Pizza and Beverage For They Are Trader Wings 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Ferrent Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Throat Into a Refreshing 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Bar Order 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Leftover Party Controci 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Summer Rum Cutting 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Coconati 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Beautiful Shicline 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Cheekey Candy Don’t be surprised if you see these in a future Lifehacker post; Claire Lower, our food and beverage editor, says she wants to attempt making some of these. But instead of waiting for her expert recipes, I decided to feed these into a neural network as well. I gathered some cocktail recipes from Chris Lowder’s cocktail guide and the WikiBooks cocktails glossary, and arranged them so that each cocktail took up one line of a text file, with the title of the cocktail as the first few words. That means I could choose a cocktail name and ask my cocktail-trained neural net to provide the recipe that follows. Here are a few of the results: The Best Coconati - oz.

"Ryan Bassil, Hannah Ewens","This article originally appeared on VICE UK. Steve McQueens Widows is loud and directjust take a look at the trailer. Credits drop in time to the haunting Junior Boys remix of Billie Holiday's ""Yesterdays."" Then Elizabeth Debickis bruised face grimaces as she recoils from a man's smug touch; Michelle Rodriguez looks pissed off; Viola Davis screams, the sound explodes from her deep within her. The noise she makes sounds like she might be mid-exorcism, physically pulling pain through and away from her. This is big-screen McQueen, full of flames and guns and big exploding cars. Colin Farrell and Liam Neeson also star, as do a frankly terrifying Daniel Kaluuya and Brian Tyree Henry (who played Paper Boi in Atlanta ). It's very Hollywood, which is not a bad thing. Like 12 Years A Slave, the British director's film will be screening in places where he'll attract an even larger audience; impacting beyond the relatively niche arthouse fanbase of his first two films, Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011). The story follows the three bereaved leading women as they pay off the $2 million debt left to them by their career criminal husbands. Kaluuya and Tyree Henrys characters want that money, and they stab and shoot and shove disabled men off their wheelchairs in attempt to get it. Much will be said about how the film reimagines the heist movie, which is true: it does. McQueens cast whip an affecting intensity into the genre, in a way thats entertaining without losing any emotional depth. This isn't a simple heist movie, though, just as no McQueen film is ever exactly what appears on the screen. Henry and Farrell's characters are running for office, bringing politics into play. In one scene (just one!), McQueen uses his signature long shot to track Farrell's blacked-out car as it moves from the projects to huge, lush mansions in minutes, splitting open the juxtaposition of class and wealth. Issues of racism, nepotism, manipulation, and religion are woven in tooa result of McQueens direction as much as the source text, an adaption of an 80s British crime drama, co-written by McQueen and novelist and screenwriter Gillian Flynn ( Gone Girl ). The most obvious theme, of course, is grief. It's in the film's name. But that grief is told through the wider lens of family and everything that it involvesthe fear and reality of loss, the knowledge of upset, regrets, lack of respect, the need to love. When Rodriguez's character decides to take part in the heist, its because she wants her ""kids to know I didnt just sit there and take it."" Through flashbacks, we learn that Davis has already lost her children and that Debickis relationship with her mother is fragile, built on toxic childhood neglect. McQueen presents each woman as resilient, capable of standing up in the face of adversitycunning and strong. Like the leads in his previous films Shame and Hunger, McQueen doesn't present these characters as good or evil. Though they may be weighted in one direction, theyre multifaceted. A great example of this is Lukas Haas character, who Debicki meets through a sugar daddy dating site. Is he manipulative, caring, honest? Whos to say. McQueen's other stylistic tropes are on display here, albeit in a less prominent way than before. He's frequently used the body to evoke a visceral reactionthe thinning of Hungers protagonist, Michael Fassbenders wang volleying across his legs in Shame, the vicious welts on the back of Chiwetel Ejiofor's Solomon Northup in 12 Years A Slave. Using the human form to powerfully effect is something McQueens done since he released one of his first short films, Bear, completed while studying at Goldsmiths, which showed two naked men wrestling and ogling each other. In Widows we get Davis pulling on a cigarette, framed so closely that you can feel the shuddering intensity of each long draw. It goes without saying that McQueen still directs like an artist, since he is one. He won the Turner Prize in 1999, he's showcased in galleries, he's studied the form. Widows combines this flair with the gripping thrill of a big screen blockbuster, creating loud moments that give way to intense devastation. The cast is greatKaluuya especially deserves a nod for his sociopathic portrayal. The inclusion of explosions and whatnot will certainly attract new fans who might not have otherwise known McQueens work. Beneath the flames, though, is an intricate and detailed story that gets into grief, love, and loss, posing as many questions as it does answers, like all good art should.

Heather Dockray,"If you're thinking about watching a movie or television series Netflix has tagged LGBTQ, proceed cautiously. Historically, they're mostly trash. Exceptions do exist. You just need know where to find them and what you can reasonably expect from a movie called Unfreedom or Margarita with a Straw. Let us help. SEE ALSO: We revisited the trauma of watching sex scenes with our parents for your entertainment Below are a list of LGBTQ-themed streamable movies that won't destroy you this Pride season. Some are good simply because they're accurate, others just have decent boning scenes. Either way, I promise they won't be so bad they'll turn you straight. Enjoy. 1. Paris is Burning (1990, dir. Jennie Livingston) If you're queer (or straight) and don't love this movie, I can't help you. Paris is Burning is the epic documentary that introduced '80s New York's queer ballroom scene to the mainstream. Populated largely by queer and trans performers of color, the film stunned audiences in 1991, scoring the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, among dozens of other smart people awards. It has since been added to the United States Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" i.e. ""good."" 2. Tangerine (2015, dir. Sean Baker) Directed by Sean Baker of The Florida Project (2018's most offensive Oscar snub ), Tangerine explores the average day in the lives of two trans sex workers in Los Angeles. It's as painful as it is loving and — I'm not just saying this to be nice — hilarious. You laugh. Tangerine was filmed on an iPhone, but it didn't make me throw up, and the narrative is so earnestly expressed the entire picture feels like documentary. 3. Pariah (2011, dir. Dee Rees) This movie is so wonderful, I'm surprised to see it on Netflix, my go-to spot for the worst on TV. Adepero Oduye stars as Alike, a teenager growing up gay in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The film has everything you could want out of a coming-of-age narrative: an attractive teacher, a rejecting crush, emo teen poetry. It won the Excellence in Cinematography award at Sundance but no actual Oscars, because Oscar voters are lame. 4. How to Win at Checkers (Every Time) (dir. 2015, Josh Kim) How to Win at Checkers pulls from Thai-American author Rattawut Lapcharoensap’s famous 2004 collection Sightseeing. Set in Bangkok, it tells the story of Oat (Ingkarat Damrongsakkul) an orphan living with his aunt on the outskirts of the capital and his relationship with his older gay brother, who's at risk of being conscripted into the military. Like so many other films in this genre, it's also a coming-of-age story, full of all the tenderness you could ask for. 5. Blue is the Warmest Color (2013, dir. Abdellatif Kechiche ) Outside of the controversial scissoring scenes, Blue is the Warmest Color is the most true-to-life lesbian coming-of-age drama I've seen, uh, ever. It's so realistic I had to walk out of the theater three times when I watched it just so I didn't get hysterical and slobber to my exes on the phone. Be forewarned: it's French and super long, plucking at every feeling you've ever had until you're fully vacuumed of emotion. 6. The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson (2017, dir. David France) If all you ever watched was Roland Emmerich's Stonewall, you'd think that the riots were started by a bunch of middle class white gay men living in the Village. Wrong! Transgender activist and woman of color Marsha P. Johnson was a principal in the riots and subsequent liberation movements. She died in 1992, and France's film explores her brief life as well as her tragic unsolved death. Required wrenching viewing. 7. Queer Eye for the Straight Guy: Season 2 (premieres June 15th) A new season of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy will be available for binge-watching right at the height of Pride season. Apparently, one of the episodes includes Pete Davidson, who we all love because (1) he posted a photo of himself in a Gryffindor t-shirt next to his new celebrity boo and (2) he agreed to do this corny-ass show. Bonus: This series is a great excuse to sit in your apartment watching TV and still technically be celebrating Pride. 8. Princess Cyd Most good LGBTQ movies are coming-of-age movies, because that's when most people are first asked to reckon with their sexualities (and we're at our most emo). The competition in this subgenre is stiff, which is why Princess Cyd comes across so beautifully: it had to werk to be this tender. The film stars Jessie Pinnick, who is forced to live with her aunt Miranda (Rebecca Spence) for a week in the summer for a relief for some drama with her father. Vulture called it an ""eloquent, open-hearted coming-of-age story"" so that should be enough to make you cry. 9. Carol (2015, dir. Todd Haynes) Who better to star in the 1950's Douglas Strickland-inspired melodrama than Cate Blanchett? (I know, I know, someone who openly identifies as queer — whatever). Carol is a textbook lesbian romance, featuring Rooney Mara as her working-class lover. I'm not sure what's more erotic than a luxury New York department store lesbian romance, but if there's anyone who can direct it, it's Todd Haynes. 10. God's Own Countr y (2017, dir. Francis Lee) A 2017 British drama about a heavy-drinking, promiscuous gay Yorkshire farmer who meets a Romanian migrant and falls in lub. Nothing compliments a Wuthering Heights backdrop more than a man who struggles to emote. And is there anything better than a dysphoric countryside queer romance? Not that I'm aware of. 11. Milk (2008, dir. Dustin Lance Black) I apologize for putting anything on this list that features Sean Penn, but when a movie is this important, you have to. Widely considered to be one of the best biopics of the past twenty years (admittedly, not a category rife with competition), Milk tells the story of Harvey Milk, the City of San Francisco's first openly gay mayor and the first openly gay official in the country. You're going to weep, but the movie earned those tears. 12. The Fosters (2013-present, dir. Peter Paige) The Fosters address every possible ""Intro to Gender Studies"" issue I could imagine in 2018, and you know what? We need it. It's a television family drama featuring trans teens, queer relationships, foster care families, and an interracial lesbian couple, one of whom is a cop (!) the other of whom is a teacher. The show ended this year and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life, except watch it over and over again.","If you're thinking about watching a movie or television series Netflix has tagged LGBTQ, proceed cautiously.

Livemint,"KOLKATA: The country's first Rajdhani Express, which revolutionised Indian Railways by way of speed and luxury in the 1960s, turned 50 Sunday as the flower-beddecked train chugged out of Howrah station on its golden jubilee run.
An Eastern Railway (ER) official said that the Kolkata-New Delhi Rajdhani Express embarked on its maiden journey on 3 March, 1969 from Howrah, making it the country's first fully-airconditioned, high-speed train that covered the 1,450 km stretch in 17 hours and 20 minutes.
The red and yellow marigold beddecked train was flagged off by three former staff of Rajdhani Express after a ceremonial cake cutting and release of a greeting stamp to commemorate the epoch-making event.
Senior officers of ER, including its general manager Harindra Rao, were present at platform number 9, which has been the berthing place of Rajdhani Express since inception.
Passengers of the golden jubilee run of the train were treated to some of its old delicacies like fish fry or vegetable cutlets and 'rosogollas' apart from ice cream for dessert, said IRCTC (East) general manager Debasish Chandra.
Rajdhani was the first train in the country whose fares included charges for meals served.
Brand new linen and disposable napkins with greetings of ""50 Years of Rajdhani Express"" were distributed among the passengers, the ER official said.
The railway staff on duty in the train wore a badge with the message of celebration of 50 glorious years of Kolkata Rajdhani Express.
Rajdhani Express commenced its maiden journey from Howrah on this day in 1969 with nine vacuum braked coaches built at Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Perambur, consisting of two power cars, five AC chair cars, one AC dining car and one AC first class coach.
With the passage of time, the chair cars were replaced with AC 2-tier and AC 3-tier coaches, apart from increasing the number of AC first class coaches, while the dining car was done away with.
The iconic train went through stages of evolution over the years, the official said, adding that the present Kolkata Rajdhani Express was upgraded with elegant makeover of existing LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) coaches in 2017.
The train is at present composed of 20 LHB coaches consisting two AC First Class, five AC 2-tier, 10 AC 3-tier with one Pantry Car and 2 Power cars-cum-luggage vans.

Jonathan Shieber,"For four years, Edhuar Arellano has left his house at 7 a.m. on weekdays to drive customers around the Bay Area for Lyft and Uber. Most days, he doesn’t get home to Santa Clara until 11 p.m. On weekends, he delivers pizzas to make ends meet. Like a lot of drivers plugging in to ride-hailing apps for work, he likes the flexibility the gig economy has offered. But given the choice, Arellano says he wishes he could just become an employee. That would get him paid vacation, benefits, overtime, his own health insurance and perhaps more say over his working conditions. “We need to accept whatever they want,” said the 55-year-old father of two grown children. “I can’t control anything.” That quandary is behind a ferocious battle quietly playing out in the Capitol in the final days of the legislative session, which ends Aug. 31. Lobbyists for ride-sharing companies and the California Chamber of Commerce are scrambling to delay until next year (and the next governor’s administration) a far-reaching California Supreme Court decision that could grant Arellano’s wish—and, businesses fear, undermine the entire gig economy. The April ruling, involving the nationwide delivery company Dynamex Operations West Inc. and its contract drivers, established a new test for enforcement of California wage laws, and made it much harder for companies in California to claim that independent contractors are not actually employees. Though the ruling only applies to California, the state’s labor force is so huge that it has already had national impact. Shortly after the decision, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont introduced a bill to make a version of California’s new rule the federal standard, a move that only added urgency to employers’ calls for state lawmakers to hit the pause button on implementing the ruling. “Businesses are very concerned. The key is who’s going to be sued here in the near future,” said Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber, which represents 50,000 businesses. They should be, says labor leader Caitlin Vega, who has been similarly lobbying Capitol Democrats to refrain from meddling and let the Supreme Court decision move forward. “Companies have made so much money already at the expense of workers,” Vega, the legislative director of the California Labor Federation said Tuesday during a harried break between Capitol meetings. “We really see the Dynamex decision as core to rebuilding the middle class.” State and federal labor laws give employees a wide range of worker protections, from overtime pay and minimum wages to the right to unionize. But those rights don’t extend to independent contractors, whose ranks have grown dramatically in the gig economy. Apps such as Uber, TaskRabbit and DoorDash, which match customers and services online and in real time, have given workers an unprecedented ability to freelance but they also have blurred traditional employer-employee relationships and, labor advocates say, invited exploitation. Some 2 million people, from Lyft drivers to construction workers, consider themselves independent contractors in California. In 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about one in 14 workers was an independent contractor nationally. If state lawmakers don’t rewrite the law or stall its implementation for a few months, as businesses want—which the Legislature can legally do, though the clock is ticking—the Dynamex decision will subject businesses in California to a standard that is tougher than the federal government’s or most states’. Known as the “ABC test,” the standard requires companies to prove that people working for them as independent contractors are: A) Free from the company’s control when they’re on the job; B) Doing work that falls outside the company’s normal business; C) And operating an independent business or trade beyond the job for which they were hired. That’s a high bar for the many companies whose bottom lines have depended on large numbers of contractors to deliver a particular service. According to the business lobby, in the months since the Dynamex decision, law firms have received 1,200 demands for arbitration and 17 class action lawsuits. Last month, business leaders sent a letter to members of Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration, warning that the new test would “decimate businesses,” and urging the governor and Legislature to suspend and then limit the court’s ruling to only workers involved in the Dynamex case. The letter also asked that the decision not apply to other contractors for the next two years. Not all those contractors are in tech, Chamber head Zaremberg points out. Emergency room doctors and accountants, for example, could also be impacted. Emergency hospitals and trauma centers contract their doctors through medical groups, and doctors generally work at a combination of hospitals and community clinics. Photo: shapecharge / iStock / Getty Images Plus Dr. Aimee Mullen, president of the California chapter of American College of Emergency Physicians, confirms that ER docs are among those uncertain about their contractor status. “A lot of our members use that model. It’s choice. They like flexibility. They like working at multiple hospitals,” Mullen said. The California Labor Federation’s Vega contends that, disruptive though it may be, the Dynamex ruling is the right one, particularly on worker exploitation. The core group affected tends to be low-income and immigrant workers, she said. “The Dynamex decision was a victory for working people—truck drivers who are cheated out of wages, warehouse workers forced to risk their health and gig economy workers who want to be treated with dignity and respect,” Vega wrote in a Sacramento Bee op-ed. Some workers see room for hybrid solutions. Edward Escobar, a San Francisco ride-hail driver of four years and founder of the Alliance for Independent Workers, a group formed by drivers three years ago, says he has seen a big decrease in how much these companies compensate drivers without a commensurate increase in control over working conditions. Escobar believes gig companies are trying to have it both ways, and should give their workers either true independence or full employment. His proposal: Let workers choose their own classification, with wage and benefit protection for those who choose to be employees, and more control for contractors over which rides to take and what prices to set. “These tech titans have been taking advantage of these gray areas,” Escobar said. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Paramount Democrat, said earlier this month that while the Legislature is eager to delve into workforce issues, leaders do not have adequate time to act on it before the session ends next week. “The Dynamex​ decision strikes at the core of what the future of work looks like in our society,” Rendon said in a statement. “From the decline of union membership to court rulings like the Janus decision, we’ve seen the continual erosion of workers’ rights. If the Legislature is to take action, we must do so thoughtfully with that in mind. That will not happen in the last three weeks of the legislative session.” Nor are the stakes likely to be lowered for workers like Arellano. “If I don’t work, I have no money,” said the Lyft and Uber driver. “Everything is so expensive in Santa Clara and the Bay Area.” CALmatters.org is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.","Antoinette Siu Contributor Share on Twitter Antoinette Siu is a reporter for CALmatters.

In this video, Entrepreneur Network partner Phil Town discusses how people in the middle class often have only $1,000 in savings and piles of debt. 
So, if your goal is to break out of the middle class and retire comfortably, here are a few habits -- or ""traps"" -- you should avoid:
Having no emergency funds.
Not investing enough.
Having no trust in the stock market (putting away money in a 401K is just the start)
Not thinking long-term.
Town recommends only buying things when it is absolutely required. Invest everything else.

Matt Novak,"The U.S. Air Force has released the first images of its latest combat drone, the XQ-58A Valkyrie. The new aircraft, which went from concept to first test flight in 2.5 years, behaved as expected on its first test flight this week, according to the Air Force.
The 76-minute inaugural flight occurred on March 5, 2019 at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona. The Air Force released a short 15-second video of the first flight to show it off, something that the military doesnt do with all of its aircraft.
The drone was developed for the Air Force Research Laboratorys (AFRL) Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program which seeks to develop new planes for the military both quickly and inexpensively. 
XQ-58A is the first example of a class of UAV that is defined by low procurement and operating costs while providing game changing combat capability, Doug Szczublewski, AFRLs XQ-58A Program Manager, said in a statement.
The XQ-58A drone reportedly has a range of well over 2,000 miles and can carry both precision-guided bombs and surveillance equipment.
As Tyler Rogoway at The Drive notes, the new drone is specially suited to operate at the direction of manned planes nearby under a concept the Air Force calls its loyal wingman program. Theoretically, a piloted fighter jet could travel alongside a number of these unpiloted Valkyries, which would assist by doing everything from jamming enemy radar to firing on a target.
Rogoway also notes that the finished drone looks remarkably like the earliest concept renderings that were released by its developer, the San Diego-based military contractor Kratos Defense. Kratos is on the forefront of the latest weapons technologies, having recently developed the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System system for the U.S. Navy. Laser weapons, which fall into the category of directed-energy weapons, are being shown off by Americas New Cold War adversary Russia with increased frequency.
The cost of the XQ-58A Valkyrie program wasnt released publicly, but the best estimates put the budget at roughly $2-3 million per plane.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Cheers of encouragement are a great morale booster, but every marathoner has fond memories of that spectator, the one who had the perfect snack or motivating words at a tough point in the race. Heres how to be that angel.
Decide where you want to be
First, a word about planning. A marathon is 26.2 miles long, and many races run a half-marathon at the same time. The half is 13.1 miles, but its course may diverge from the main event. Be sure to check the races website to know who is running and where, and station yourself appropriately. A rough guide: 
Mile 5: Everybody is feeling good
Mile 10: Half marathoners are getting tired but they know the finish is coming soon. Full marathoners are getting tired and trying not to think about it. 
Mile 15: Things are starting to get rough. Most of the runners have been on the course for 2+ hours. Theyre cramping, theyre hungry, their legs hurt. But theyre still moving.
Mile 20: This is the low point for a lot of runners. Theres a saying that you can split a marathon into two halves: the first 20, and the last 6.2. Most runners passing the 20-mile mark are, or soon will be, exhausted and desperate.
Mile 25: This is the home stretch! The runners have been through a lot but they know theyre almost at the finish.
World class marathoners will make it through the course in a little over 2 hours (for men) or two and a half (for women). People who take 3+ hours are experienced, strong runners; those who take 4+ would often describe themselves as recreational athletes. People who take 5+ hours are usually mixing in some walking with their running, and/or started with one of the other groups but ended up really struggling. 
With this information, you can decide where to set up, and when. Since this is a multi-hour event, you may want to find a few spots and move between them. Consider who will pass by your station, and how they might be feeling. 
Hand out food
Posters and cheers are greatand well get to thosebut if you really want to do something special, have a snack or drink that the marathon doesnt officially provide. These are especially appreciated in the later miles of the race. Some ideas: 
Orange slices, or other juicy fruit
Gummy worms, or other candy thats not too hard to eat on the run
Starchy food, like pieces of plain bagel (this is the one time its acceptable to cut them St. Louis style) 
Salty food, like pretzels or chips
Beer
Cold coffee (I havent seen this in person, but there is demand for it) 
Cookies, cake balls, or anything delicious. These folks havent eaten anything delicious all day. 
Remember that people will be grabbing the snacks with sweaty hands and little to no coordination. (They will also be much less interested in cleanliness at mile 20 than at mile 10). Plan accordingly, and make things easy to grab. Small portions are better than large ones; people can always take two. 
Provide relief from hot weather
Marathons tend to be in the spring and fall, to avoid the years hottest weather. A typical marathon day is cold at the start and warms during the course of the race. That means that by mile 15 or 20, the sun may be beating down on runners who are already feeling beaten-up. If its a hot day, consider helping folks cool down: 
If you live along the race course, set out your sprinkler or even just stand around with a garden hose and let people run through. 
This one is great for kids: bring a super soaker, and a sign encouraging runners to ask for a squirt. 
Bring a cooler full of...well, anything cold. Fla-vor-ice popsicles are cheap and you can cut them in half with scissors.
Give motivation
This category is the cheapest, but it can be the most thoughtful. Theres a lot you can say to a runner to give them the strength to carry on. Not everybody will be receptive to your message, but youll make the difference for somebody. 
High fives. Seriously, just stand on the sidewalk and hold your hand out. Ill totally perk up and run across the street for a high five from a kid. 
Creative high fives, like a poster that says tap for a power up or wear a Mario costume and give fist bumps
Yell the name on peoples bibs. A lot of marathons let you put your name on the bib under your number, or people will sometimes sharpie their name on their shirt. Cheer them on by name, or by description: Lookin strong, pink shirt! You got this!
Funny signs, like genuinely funny ones. I appreciate Most Boring Parade Ever and Seems like a lot of work for a free banana. Senses of humor vary, but do your best. 
If someone is having an especially hard time, consider giving some personal words of encouragement, like so:","Cheers of encouragement are a great morale booster, but every marathoner has fond memories of that spectator, the one who had the perfect snack or motivating words at a tough point in the race.

Victoria Song,"Facebooks nightmare 2018 might be over, but its 2019 is just getting started. A federal judge ruled Monday to make public a new batch of court documents detailing how Facebook made money off children.
The documents come from a 2012 class-action lawsuit and will be made public thanks to requests by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. A sneak peek into records given to the nonprofit in October reportedly shows Facebooks own employees were concerned they were effectively tricking children into racking up thousands of dollars in game charges. The documents also indicate Facebook failed to give parents refunds, according to Reveal.
The lead plaintiff in the case involves a child who unwittingly racked up thousands in charges while playing a Facebook game. In this instance, the child was unaware Facebook had his mothers credit card on file as the kid unwittingly bought virtual currency, according to court documents, which resulted in several hundred dollars in charges over a few weeks. While the mother requested a refund from Facebook, the company did not comply, and the family ultimately filed a lawsuit.
According to Reveal, the records also highlight how some Facebook employees raised concerns that parents were being charged without their consent. One example cited by Reveal indicates the social media giant knew the average Angry Birds player on the platform was just 5 years old. Facebook also reportedly knew that in nearly all cases, parents did not think their children would be able to make additional purchases without authorization or passwords, and that children were likely to be confused as in-game currency wouldnt appear to be real money to minors.
One particularly disturbing exchange involves two Facebook employees debating whether to issue a refund request involving a child who inadvertently charged over $6,000 in just two weeks. The child is described as a whale, a casino term used to describe reckless spenders.
Gillian: Would you refund this whale ticket? User is disputing ALL charges
Michael: Whats the users total lifetime spend?
Gillian: Its $6,545 but card was just added on Sept. 2. They are disputing all of it I believe. That user looks underage as well. Well, maybe not under 13.
Michael: Is the user writing in a parent, or is this user a 13ish year old
Gillian: Its a 13ish yr old. says its 15. looks a bit younger. she* not its. Lol.
Michael: I wouldnt refund
Gillian: Oh thats fine. cool. agreed. just double checking
Yuck. Expect more messed up details to come to light in the coming days. Facebook has about 10 days to make the majority of the documents, which total over 100 pages, public.

Jonathan Shieber,"How do you know your product is priced too low? One way is when you raise the price between 13 and 18%, you have almost no churn, not many complaints, and your stock price actually goes up!
When Netflix  class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoney.com%2Fmoney%2F5504301%2Fnetflix-raising-prices-stock%2F"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" data-href=""https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoney.com%2Fmoney%2F5504301%2Fnetflix-raising-prices-stock%2F""&gt;increased their prices a few weeks ago, investors were so confident in the revenue increase that would be delivered that they didnt even wait to see what customers reaction would be.
Netflix spends an astounding amount of money on content rights and content developmentsupposedly budgeting $15 billion for 2019and resulting in $3 billion in negative cash flow, which is heavily funded with debtat $10.4 billion by the end 2018.
Even at its already large size, the company continues to grow rapidly, so I am not suggesting their cash flow or spending is any cause for concern.
What I am suggesting is that Netflix is too cheap, and could likely be cashflow profitable without reducing investment in content, by implementing some pricing model changes. The fact that customers and investors did not seem to bat an eyelid at the recent price increase gives me some confidence that they are not maximizing profit per customer!
In some scenarios, especially early on, companies decide to focus on customer acquisition at the expense of revenue maximization. Other than the unfathomable madness of some companies that do this while running a negative GROSS margin (a big thank you to their investors for subsidizing consumers!), market share land grabs in B2C can make sense. It looks like Netflix has been focussed on market share for a long time and continues to focus on maximizing subscriber numbers over profit.
But is it really a linear equationwhere an increase in price will result in a decrease in new subscribers or total subscribers? Clearly not in this case. Wouldnt it be worth at least testing variations on the pricing model in somemarket segments to discover the optimum value price?
Quick definitionthe Optimum Value Price is where you can capture the highest number of customers, at the right price for each type of customer.  
Right nowNetflix differentiates price in 2 ways onlynumber of screens, and HD or Ultra HD. I think Ultra HD is a bit of a red herring as most devices and connections are not capable of getting it, and theres not much content either. So reallythe primary driver of price is number of screens1 for $9, 2 for $13 and 4 for $16.
This assumes the only difference between customers is the number of devices they want to watch content on at the same time. This is a misnomer. No one is watching 2 devices simultaneously one with each eye?! So its really the number of users on an account 1 user for $9, 2 users for $13 (nearly a 30% discount off list) or 4 users for $16 (a 45% discount from a single user account).
Consider some of the likely differences between consumers, and the variables by which they derive value: 
Number of Hours Watched
Variety of Content Consumed (number of different shows and movies)
Binge Watchers
Demographics (geographic and individual)
Devices, Connections and Locations Watched From
Frequency and Length of Simultaneous Connections
If you wanted to be aggressive, you could think about time of day, early access to new series and movies, premium content, subscriptions to different genres. But lets keep it simple for nowheres a slightly more value-based pricing plan idea:
The base plan price hasnt been changed but that may be doableso these increases are from what might already be a not optimized starting point.
On the Unlimited Planthink about how many people have more than 1 user, watch Netflix multiple times a week, dont ever want to think about usage limits and are not price sensitive to $30 a month for something they use regularly (and that has exclusive content they really want to see Netflix has so many must watch shows!)? Is it 10% of US subscribers? If so, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows thats likely over $1bn in 100% margin contributing revenue.
The real question is thisif Netflix changed its pricing model to be a little more complex and value-basedwhat is the level of change that can be sustained without materially reducing subscriber retention and addition? My guess is theres at least enough leeway to reduce the need for debt to fund content.","Ed Byrne Contributor Share on Twitter Ed Byrne is an entrepreneur, investor and co-founder of Scaleworks.

More about Ahmed…
In this tutorial, well use the latest versions of Bootstrap 4 and Angular 7 to build an Angular application and style the interface with Bootstrap. Well make use of some new BS4 features to display data.
In case youve already tried building a web application with Angular 7, its time to kick it up a notch. Lets see how we can integrate Bootstrap CSS styles and JavaScript files with an Angular project generated using the Angular CLI, and how to use form controls and classes to create beautiful forms and how to style HTML tables using Table styles.
For the Angular part, well be creating a simple client-side application for creating and listing contacts. Each contact has an ID, name, email, and description, and well be using a simple data service that stores the contacts in a TypeScript array. You can use an advanced in-memory API instead. (Check out A Complete Guide To Routing In Angular.)
Note: You can get the source code of this tutorial from this GitHub repository and see the live example over here.
Requirements
Before we start creating the demo application, lets see the requirements needed for this tutorial.
Basically, you will need the following:
Node.js and NPM installed (you can simply head on over to the official website and download the binaries for your system),
Familiarity with TypeScript,
Working experience of Angular,
Basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
Web forms are such an important part of the web, but we design them poorly all the time. The brand-new Form Design Patterns book is our new practical guide for people who design, prototype and build all sorts of forms for digital services, products and websites. The eBook is free for Smashing Members.
Check the table of contents 
Installing Angular CLI
Lets start by installing the latest version of Angular CLI. In your terminal, run the following command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
At the time writing, v7.0.3 of Angular CLI is installed. If you have the CLI already installed, you can make sure you have the latest version by using this command:
$ ng --version
Creating A Project
Once you have Angular CLI installed, lets use it to generate an Angular 7 project by running the following command:
$ ng new angular-bootstrap-demo
The CLI will then ask you:
Would you like to add Angular routing?
Press Y. Next, it will ask you:
Which stylesheet format would you like to use?
Choose CSS.
Adding Bootstrap
After creating the project, you need to install Bootstrap 4 and integrate it with your Angular project.
First, navigate inside your projects root folder:
$ cd angular-bootstrap-demo
Next, install Bootstrap 4 and jQuery from npm:
$ npm install --save bootstrap jquery
(In this case, bootstrap v4.2.1 and jquery v3.3.1 are installed.)
Finally, open the angular.json file and add the file paths of Bootstrap CSS and JS files as well as jQuery to the styles and scripts arrays under the build target:
""architect"": {
 ""build"": {
 [...], 
 ""styles"": [
 ""src/styles.css"", 
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css""
 ],
 ""scripts"": [
 ""node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"",
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js""
 ]
 },
Check out how to add Bootstrap to an Angular 6 project for options on how to integrate Bootstrap with Angular.
Adding A Data Service
After creating a project and adding Bootstrap 4, well create an Angular service that will be used to provide some demo data to display in our application.
In your terminal, run the following command to generate a service:
$ ng generate service data
This will create two src/app/data.service.spec.ts and src/app/data.service.ts files.
Open src/app/data.service.ts and replace its contents with the following:
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
 providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
contacts = [
 {id: 1, name: ""Contact 001"", description: ""Contact 001 des"", email: ""c001@email.com""},
 {id: 2, name: ""Contact 002"", description: ""Contact 002 des"", email: ""c002@email.com""},
 {id: 3, name: ""Contact 003"", description: ""Contact 003 des"", email: ""c003@email.com""},
 {id: 4, name: ""Contact 004"", description: ""Contact 004 des"", email: ""c004@email.com""}
 ];
constructor() { }
public getContacts():Array&lt;{id, name, description, email}&gt;{
 return this.contacts;
 }
 public createContact(contact: {id, name, description, email}){
 this.contacts.push(contact);
 }
}
We add a contacts array with some demo contacts, a getContacts() method which returns the contacts and a createContact() which append a new contact to the contacts array.
Adding Components
After creating the data service, next we need to create some components for our application. In your terminal, run:
$ ng generate component home
$ ng generate component contact-create
$ ng generate component contact-list
Next, well add these components to the routing module to enable navigation in our application. Open the src/app/app-routing.module.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { ContactListComponent } from './contact-list/contact-list.component';
import { ContactCreateComponent } from './contact-create/contact-create.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
const routes: Routes = [
 {path: """", pathMatch: ""full"",redirectTo: ""home""},
 {path: ""home"", component: HomeComponent},
 {path: ""contact-create"", component: ContactCreateComponent},
 {path: ""contact-list"", component: ContactListComponent} 
];
@NgModule({
 imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
 exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
We use the redirectTo property of the routers path to redirect users to the home page when they visit our application.
Next, lets create the header and footer components:
$ ng generate component header
$ ng generate component footer
Open the src/app/header/header.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;nav class=""navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""navbar-brand"" href=""#""&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;button class=""navbar-toggler"" type=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#navbarCollapse"" aria-controls=""navbarCollapse""
 aria-expanded=""false"" aria-label=""Toggle navigation""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""navbar-toggler-icon""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;div class=""collapse navbar-collapse"" id=""navbarCollapse""&gt;
 &lt;ul class=""navbar-nav mr-auto""&gt;
&lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/home""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-list""&gt;Contacts&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-create""&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
A navigation bar will be created with Bootstrap 4, and well use the routerLink directive to link to different components.
Use the .navbar, .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} and .navbar-dark classes to create Bootstrap navigation bars. (For more information about nav bars, check out Bootstraps documentation on Navbar.
Next, open the src/app/header/header.component.css file and add:
.nav-item{
 padding:2px;
 margin-left: 7px;
}
Next, open the src/app/footer/footer.component.html file and add:
&lt;footer&gt;
 &lt;p class=""text-xs-center""&gt;© Copyright 2019. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
Open the src/app/footer/footer.component.css file and add:
footer {
 position: absolute;
 right: 0;
 bottom: 0;
 left: 0;
 padding: 1rem;
 text-align: center;
}
Next, open the src/app/app.component.html file and replace its contents with the following:
&lt;app-header&gt;&lt;/app-header&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
&lt;app-footer&gt;&lt;/app-footer&gt;
Were creating an application shell by using the header and footer components which means that they will be present on every page of our application. The only part that will be changed is what will be inserted in the router outlet (check out The Application Shell on the Angular website for more information).
Adding A Bootstrap Jumbotron
According to the Bootstrap docs:
A Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.
Lets add a Jumbotron component to our home page. Open the src/app/home/home.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""jumbotron"" style=""background-color: #fff; height: calc(95vh);""&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p class=""lead""&gt;
 This demo shows how to integrate Bootstrap 4 with Angular 7 
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a class=""btn btn-lg btn-primary"" href="""" role=""button""&gt;View tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The .jumbotron class is used to create a Bootstrap Jumbotron.
Adding A List Component: Using A Bootstrap Table
Now lets create a component-to-list data from the data service and use a Bootstrap 4 table to display tabular data.
First, open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.ts file and inject the data service then call the getContacts() method to get data when the component is initialized:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-list',
 templateUrl: './contact-list.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-list.component.css']
})
export class ContactListComponent implements OnInit {
contacts;
 selectedContact;
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 this.contacts = this.dataService.getContacts(); 
 }
 public selectContact(contact){
 this.selectedContact = contact;
 }
}
We added two variables contactsand selectedContact which hold the set of contacts and the selected contact. And a selectContact() method which assigns the selected contact to the selectedContact variable.
Open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
 &lt;table class=""table table-hover""&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr *ngFor=""let contact of contacts""&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ contact.id }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.name }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.email }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" (click)=""selectContact(contact)""&gt; Show details&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card text-center"" *ngIf=""selectedContact""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-header""&gt;
 # {{selectedContact.id}}
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-block""&gt;
 &lt;h4 class=""card-title""&gt;{{selectedContact.name}}&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p class=""card-text""&gt;
 {{selectedContact.description}}
 &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We simply loop through the contacts array and display each contact details and a button to select a contact. If the contact is selected, a Bootstrap 4 Card with more information will be displayed.
This is the definition of a Card from Bootstrap 4 docs:
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youre familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
We use the .table and .table-hover classes to create Bootstrap-styled tables, the .card, .card-block, .card-title and .card-text classes to create cards. (For more information, check out Tables and Cards.)
Adding A Create Component: Using Bootstrap Form Controls And Classes
Lets now add a form to our contact-create component. First, we need to import the FormsModule in our main application module. Open the src/app/app.module.ts file, import FormsModule from @angular/forms, and add it to the imports array:
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
/* ... */
@NgModule({
 declarations: [
 /* ... */
 ],
 imports: [
 BrowserModule,
 AppRoutingModule,
 FormsModule
 ],
 providers: [],
 bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-create',
 templateUrl: './contact-create.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-create.component.css']
})
export class ContactCreateComponent implements OnInit {
contact : {id, name, description, email} = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 }
createContact(){
 console.log(this.contact);
 this.dataService.createContact(this.contact);
 this.contact = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
}
}
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
&lt;div class=""col-sm-8 offset-sm-2""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;form&gt;
 &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
 &lt;label for=""id""&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.id"" type=""text"" name=""id"" class=""form-control"" id=""id"" aria-describedby=""idHelp"" placeholder=""Enter ID""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""idHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts ID&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""name""&gt;Contact Name&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.name"" type=""text"" name=""name"" class=""form-control"" id=""name"" aria-describedby=""nameHelp"" placeholder=""Enter your name""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""nameHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts name&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""email""&gt;Contact Email&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.email"" type=""text"" name=""email"" class=""form-control"" id=""email"" aria-describedby=""emailHelp""
 placeholder=""Enter your email""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""nameHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts email&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""description""&gt;Contact Description&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;textarea [(ngModel)]=""contact.description"" name=""description"" class=""form-control"" id=""description"" aria-describedby=""descHelp""&gt;
 &lt;/textarea&gt;
 &lt;small id=""descHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts description&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" (click)=""createContact()""&gt;Create contact&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We use the .form-group, .form-control classes to create a Bootstrap-styled form (check out Forms for more information).
We use the ngModel directive to bind the form fields to the components’ variable. For data binding to properly work, you need to give each form field a name.

Cyrus Farivar,"reader comments 2 Federal agents arrested a former NASA contractor at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday, accusing him of sextortion. According to the August 28 indictment, Richard Gregory Bauer, 28, used Facebook to send questions to his victims for his purported ""human societies class."" He asked his marks for things like their pets' names and where their parents met—queries that are often similar, if not identical, to prompts used in password-reset tools. After doing so, he would seemingly use those passwords to access their accounts, sometimes stumbling upon nude or semi-nude photographs. Sometimes, he would convince victims to install malware that included keyloggers, enabling him to capture logins and passwords. Prosecutors say Bauer would then send one or more copies of such photos to his female victims and demand more pictures. He allegedly would often specify various types, such as ""just underwear; your face doesn't have to be visible."" If these women did not meet his demands, Bauer threatened to publish photos of them online. It is not clear how many of these women complied with his demands. He is believed to have targeted at least seven women. Bauer was arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday, where he entered a not guilty plea, and was represented by Deputy Federal Public Defnder Kelly Swanton.
