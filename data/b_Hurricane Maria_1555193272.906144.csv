JOSEPH B. TREASTER,"Two University of Puerto Rico art museums lost chunks of their roofs: Casa Roig, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired two-story house 45 minutes south of San Juan, and the Museum of Art at the Mayagüez campus on the west coast. Casa Roig’s paneled ceilings partially collapsed. The wind blew out windows and broke a set of stained glass interior doors. It ripped tiles off mosaics. Putting Casa Roig back together is expected to cost nearly $400,000. In Mayagüez, Zorali De Feria, the museum director, found mold on a mural and a handful of paintings. She gave them first aid and alternated putting the paintings briefly in the sunlight and in the shade of a breezeway. Photo Tile mosaics in the home at the Casa Roig Museum were already fragile and damaged, but suffered more loss with hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Right after the storm, in her unlit office, Ms. De Feria wrote out a plea for help in longhand. The National Endowment for the Humanities sent her $30,000. Ms. Ramírez, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, also received $30,000 from the Endowment. She is putting her money toward the purchase of a generator that, with installation, is going to cost $110,000. “We need a generator, too,” Ms. De Feria said. The electricity came back sooner for both museums than in most of the island, but generators would have greatly reduced the risk and the stress. Ms. Pérez, who is also president of the Association of Puerto Rican Art Museums, and her colleagues have begun to rethink almost everything about their museums and hurricanes. Many museums did not have emergency operations plans. Some did not have home addresses for staff members. Cellphones and landlines were knocked out. Gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. The museums became isolated. With help from the Smithsonian and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ms. Pérez has been organizing conferences and workshops. At the top of the agenda: satellite telephones, generators and extra fuel tanks. Solar panels have been mentioned, and some art specialists are enthusiastic about creating emergency art storage vaults around the island, perhaps by converting buildings at abandoned but well-maintained military bases.

JAMES WAGNER,"The league also reduced the players’ maximum stipend — essentially gas and extra spending money — to $100 from about $300 for a weekend. Some players with professional experience, like Cayey’s Fernando Cabrera, 36, the top starting pitcher in the league who once pitched for the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians, get tips from fans on the side for winning. “It’ll be a tougher season: doubleheaders, under the sun, the lower pay, the traveling,” said Richard González, 29, the Toritos second baseman. “But at the end of the day, we’re doing what we love to do, which is to play baseball and for the people of Cayey.” The extra cash would have helped González, who started his own baseball equipment business called Dux Sports after playing college baseball at Virginia Commonwealth University. When he wasn’t drafted by a major league team, he returned to Puerto Rico and is in his eighth season playing in the Doble A. After Hurricane Maria hit, González lost power in his home in Caguas, a city 30 minutes south of San Juan, for three months. He didn’t have a generator, cellphone service was dead, and orders for his baseball equipment went unfilled, so he spent two months with family and his business partner in Tampa. He returned in December. “If you play this league for the money, you don’t have a chance,” he said. “You play because of your love and passion for baseball.” The Toritos’ manager, Edgardo Lebrón, 35, a former Minnesota Twins minor leaguer who works at a baseball academy, said his home in Las Piedras, an hour from Cayey, sustained $70,000 worth of damage and the electricity still has not returned. He has spent thousands on gasoline to feed a generator. As Lebrón stopped his front door from being blown away by the hurricane winds, he said his 10-year-old son turned to him, crying, and said, “Dad, let’s pray; we’re going to die.” Continue reading the main story","Puerto Rico’s pre-eminent amateur league has played every season since 1940.

Swapna Krishna,"The telescope's fate had previously been uncertain. Back in 2016, the National Science Foundation announced that it was exploring different options in regard to Arecibo. There wasn't enough funding to continue supporting the telescope, so the NSF was looking at partnering with other organizations, scaling back or shutting down Arecibo entirely. That same year, the observatory was the first to capture repeating cosmic radio bursts, which have helped us understand the nature of our galaxy and the universe around it. This murky situation was made much worse by the events of Hurricane Maria. The hurricane decimated the region of Puerto Rico in which the telescope is located, also called Arecibo. The telescope was damaged as well, but repairs were quickly made and the observatory was back up and running a week after the storm, albeit on generator power. (Almost one-third of Puerto Rico's residents are still without power, five months after Hurricane Maria hit). While the NSF decided not to shut down the telescope, it wasn't clear what would happen. But now, this new agreement ensures that Arecibo Observatory will remain open. It is scheduled to take effect on April 1st. UCF and its partners, Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan and Yang Enterprises, Inc. in Oviedo, also plan to expand the operations of the telescope. It's good news for the scientific community, and also for Puerto Rico.","Arecibo Observatory, which is the second-largest radio telescope in the world, is under new management.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“We’re in a downward spiral,” Mr. Cofiño said. The tuition increase was ratified on Monday by the federal control board that oversees the finances of Puerto Rico’s bankrupt government, which is $72 billion in debt because of an economic recession that has lasted 11 years. Most of protesters’ wrath on Tuesday was directed at the unpopular board, which they view as undemocratic. Puerto Rico’s elected leaders are subject to the board and to a federal judge handling the island’s bankruptcy in court. “This is an entity that was not elected by the people of Puerto Rico,” said Edwin Morales Laboy, the vice president of a teachers’ union that organized its members to attend the protest. Participating meant losing a day’s pay, since the government did not declare Tuesday a holiday. But teachers said they had no choice but to protest, given the plan by Puerto Rico’s Department of Education to close 280 of about 1,100 public schools on the island this summer, citing low enrollment. That comes after 179 schools were shuttered last year by the Rosselló administration. “We found out from the press,” said Lourdes Torres Santos, 31, who teaches at República del Perú, a San Juan middle school scheduled to close. “A lot of the teachers cried.” In the coming weeks, Ms. Torres expects to lose her job.

Pool/The Dallas Morning News, via Associated Press MIAMI — A major failure knocked out the electricity in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, leaving the entire island without power nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria destroyed the electrical grid. It could take up to 36 hours to restore electricity to affected customers, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority said on Twitter. Prepa attributed the blackout to a failure in a line that begins in the island’s largest power plant. It was the second widespread failure in less than a week, underscoring just how fragile Puerto Rico’s electricity remains since the storm hit on Sept. 20.

RICK ROJAS and LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ,"Where the families in the hotels will ultimately end up remains to be seen. In lobby of the Hartford hotel, one woman said that her daughter had gotten a nursing job and that her family was looking for an apartment. Among others, there was an air of weariness, as they anguished over what might come next. Job interviews had been unsuccessful or language barriers made it difficult to find work. Some were simply aimless as weeks went by with little to do. When Ms. Febres needed to go to the store, her family made the three-mile walk to a Walmart just because they wanted to burn energy. Many were still reeling from the trauma that has festered since the storm. Ms. Arroyo was flown to New York City on Nov. 15 and spent two weeks with an aunt before checking into a hotel in Corona, Queens. She suffers from a litany of medical conditions, including diabetes and depression. She needs a wheelchair and is blind in her left eye, which is covered by a patch of white gauze taped to her reading glasses. After the storm and before her evacuation to New York, she was largely confined to her bed in her home in Ponce, cared for by her father’s widow. Stuck in sweltering heat, she worried that wounds on her body would become infected. She was so fearful she even wrote a will and instructions to cremate her remains on the back of a photograph of her father and mother, which she clutched in her hands as she slept. “I don’t know how I survived,” she said. Yanitza Cruz, who is nearly eight months pregnant, was told when she checked into the hotel in Queens in December that she could stay until Feb. 14. She has become increasingly worried as the deadline approaches; her calls to FEMA yielded few answers. When she tried to check the status of her case online, the website said it had been “withdrawn.” “The clock is ticking,” she said. “Time is against us.” She traveled to Queens with her husband, Joel García, and 5-year-old daughter, Janesty, from the mountain town of Orocovis, southwest of San Juan. They had been drawn by the promise that New York appeared to offer, fueling hopes of getting an apartment and, for Mr. García, becoming a licensed barber in the city he saw as a “barbershop mecca.” It seemed different from home, where they struggled even before the hurricane. “We didn’t even have a car in Puerto Rico,” Mr. García said. “We would walk with our bags under the sun. Now we’re in a place where for $2.75 I can travel to Brooklyn. I see this as an opportunity. But the thing is, we haven’t found stability yet. I’m just looking for stability.” It is difficult to tell when that stability might ever come, but last week they did receive a measure of relief. FEMA called to let them know they could stay in the hotel another month. Rick Rojas reported from Hartford, and Luis Ferré-Sadurní from New York.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September. It took several months to restore electricity to most of the region — and then suddenly, on April 18, an island-wide blackout put residents back in the dark again. ""It’s like the hurricane came all over again,"" says Norma I. Melendez, 55, who's lived in Patillas since age 3. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" SEE ALSO: The power is out again in Puerto Rico, 7 months after Hurricane Maria Despite the sense of despair, local residents like Melendez are organizing to provide the community essential resources, such as clothes, food, medical supplies, and access to medical examinations. That story of improvisation and resilience is common across Puerto Rico, despite slow-moving recovery efforts. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" Though most of the island is back on the power grid, roughly 90,000 Puerto Ricans still don't have electricity, and those that do worry about and experience intermittent blackouts. The power outage last month, caused by accidental damage to a transmission line, left most of the island's 3.3 million residents without electricity for a day. While all customers are expected to have power by the end of May, that's around when hurricane season begins, and activists say the island's infrastructure is woefully unprepared for new storm-related threats. In Patillas, Melendez and her neighbors are still focused on recovery. She volunteers with and writes funding proposals for a nonprofit community organization called Guardarraya Unidos Por Un Patrimonio Educativo (GUPE), which partners with other groups like the Red Cross and Salvation Army to obtain supplies for local distribution. GUPE has handed out solar lanterns, medical equipment, food, and bottled water to residents, many of whom are 65 or older and have severe medical conditions or disabilities. The organization operates out of an abandoned school, and it doesn't have the funds to buy generators or water tanks. There are moments when the stakes and urgency of the situation feel daunting, Melendez says. But then neighbors will share medical equipment, food, or clothes with each other, often using GUPE as a conduit. “Puerto Rico's Senate has ordered government agencies to explain why tens of thousands of people in rural areas remain without power or appropriate shelter as anger grows about the lack of basic services more than 7 months after hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria.” https://t.co/xs5t2UtFtE — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) April 25, 2018 ""That gave us the energy to continue because we know that GUPE is reaching people and the people are reaching GUPE,"" she says. GUPE is receiving logistical and material support from multiple nonprofit organizations, including the aid and relief group Mercy Corps. Karla Peña, emergency response program manager for Mercy Corps, says she frequently sees a spirit of cooperation and generosity across communities in Puerto Rico. Neighbors share refrigerators and keep an eye on people with few family members in the area as well as those who can't easily travel to get food, water, and gas. Yet, that individual and collective resilience can wear thin in the absence of external support from nonprofits and the government. Indeed, there's a battle over how Puerto Rico will be rebuilt given that it has $74 billion in municipal debt, and the island's governor has moved to privatize the power authority. Community and labor activists worry that privatization will put Puerto Rico's fate in the hands of unaccountable private corporations. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time."" As that fight unfolds, many Puerto Ricans feel like they're stuck in survival mode, says Peña. During the most recent power outage last month, Peña says lines for gas and water rivaled post-hurricane levels. Even when the power is on, Peña keeps ice in the refrigerator and her ""hurricane kit"" — a camping stove and emergency supplies — at the ready. After months of use, generators break down often. Meanwhile, families have exhausted their financial resources to buy fuel. Those still without power rely on solar lanterns or, if they have one, a working generator. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time,"" Peña says. Melissa Mark-Viverito, former New York City Council Speaker and campaign director to the advocacy coalition Power 4 Puerto Rico, lauds the recovery work happening in communities across the island, but says those efforts need more support. Mark-Viverito envisions new investments in community-led projects to develop sustainable power sources, which could generate jobs and help stem the number of Puerto Ricans leaving the island to live in the United States. (Power 4 Puerto Rico recently wrote a letter to members of Congress urging them to adopt a ""community-driven"" approach to rebuilding.) But Mark-Viverito says that without meaningful support for innovative solutions developed by local communities, ""we're not going to be able to take advantage of this moment. What happened with the blackout demonstrates how vulnerable we are."" Back in Patillas, Melendez is focused on one of GUPE's many projects: providing breakfast and lunch to dozens of elderly residents who are homebound. The need pre-existed Hurricane Maria but has become more urgent in the storm's wake. Though it'll take considerable local and outside resources to provide those meals, Melendez is confident the nonprofit — and its supporters — can make it happen. ""When we fall down, or something happens or someone comes to the facilities and we don’t think we have anything for them,"" she says, ""someone else will say, 'I want to give you something if you need it.'""","The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"That absurd figure, and that condescension, are what make the study by independent researchers from Harvard and other institutions, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, so needed. After surveying random households across the island and comparing mortality rates they encountered to those before Maria, they came up with an estimated 4,645 additional deaths through the end of the year — a third of them people who died for lack of medical care. Puerto Rico has now commissioned its own study. But the very fact that the official toll was so obviously wrong reflects the disdain that has permeated the response to Maria. A death toll is a critical measure of the scale of a catastrophe, shaping both the public and official response. There is no telling how many lives could have been saved had the federal government been aware of the carnage rather than patting itself on the back. As Mayor Cruz, a sharp critic of the Trump administration’s response, said in an interview in March, Hurricane Maria opened Puerto Rican eyes “to our inequity — and our inequality.” The island, a commonwealth of the United States whose people are American citizens, remains in need of help. Parts of the island are still without electricity, thousands of residents lack shelter, and much remains in ruins. As many as 135,000 Puerto Ricans have left for the states. As reporters for The Times wrote in a major report in early May, after Maria and a preceding hurricane called Irma, “Puerto Rico all but slipped from the modern era.” When confronted with the Harvard study, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, responded with more self-congratulation, claiming that the government had responded to Maria with the largest Federal Emergency Management Agency effort ever. Yet what Puerto Rico really needs to recover is the sort of generous, urgent and long-term assistance that would come with a recognition by the states that a great calamity has befallen their fellow Americans, that these people dying from a lack of the most basic services are their countrymen, their responsibility.","A new study points to a far higher death toll from Hurricane Maria, more evidence of the Trump administration’s neglect.",2018-06-03T23:45:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Shame in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/opinion/puerto-rico-hurricane-deaths.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/opinion/04mon2sub/04mon2sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
Marcus Gilmer,"Seven months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still dealing with the fallout as it experienced an island-wide blackout on Wednesday. SEE ALSO: The mayor of Puerto Rico's capital can't believe this tiny firm's $300 million contract This latest power outage follows a series of outages in the months since Maria. Just last week, half of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's (PREPA) customers lost power when a tree fell across a major power line. And in November 2017, San Juan and several other cities lost power at least twice due to a failure. There's no word on what caused this latest outage, with PREPA hoping to have power restored in the next 24 to 36 hours. Per CNN, PREPA is focusing primary efforts on getting power back to hospital and water services as well as banks and the city of San Juan. One spotlight event will go on as scheduled, though.

Controversy has followed recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, including President Trump's disastrous response to the storm and the much-debated contract initially given to Whitefish Energy to repair the power infrastructure. And the exact death toll from the storm is still unknown; while the official number stands at 65, this number is likely far too low, with some estimates pegging it at closer to 1,000.","Seven months after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is still dealing with the fallout as it experienced an island-wide blackout on Wednesday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Puerto Ricans have suffered repeated power cuts since Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico has suffered an island-wide power outage nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the island's infrastructure and power grid. The US territory's power authority, known as Prepa, said it was working to restore service to almost 3.4 million people within 24 to 36 hours. Prepa said an excavator operated by a contractor in the southern region of the island caused the blackout. It is the latest and largest disruption to hit the island's recovery efforts. A Prepa spokesperson said it was prioritising returning power to hospitals, San Juan's airport, water pumping systems and financial systems. The power authority, which has been in bankruptcy since last July, has struggled to stay out of the headlines since the island was hit in September by the worst storm in 90 years. Media caption 'We have lived through things nobody thought liveable' Residents have suffered multiple blackouts since Category 4 Maria, and 40,000 people were still without power at the time of Wednesday's blackout. ""Seven months after Maria, we are back where Maria left us,"" Cynthia Garcia Coll, a professor at Carlos Albizu University in San Juan, told CNN. The US territory's first island-wide outage comes less than a week after a fallen tree knocked out service to 870,000 customers.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Its been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow. New imagery released on Monday at the American Geophysical Unions annual meeting shows the challenges of getting the light back on. The insights the researchers reveal could be used to help respond to the next disaster on the island or anywhere throughout the Caribbean. The images are what NASA calls its black marble. Its like the blue marblesatellite images of Earth in the daytimebut for nighttime viewing. To create them, NASA scientists looked at satellite images captured at night and weeded out fires, reflective surfaces like lakes that might catch the glimmer of the moon, and other natural sources of light. They took what was leftall the human sources of lightand overlaid it on a striking black map of Puerto Rico. The before-Maria image is vibrant, showing San Juan shining bright like a diamond, and the constellation of smaller cities like Ponce, Mayaguez, and Caguas lit up like Orions belt across the southern tier of the territory. But in images of Puerto Rico after Maria, which struck as a Category 5 monster in September 2017, the entire island is basically dark as only those with solar panels or generators were able to light up their houses. The lights slowly flickered back on, but NASA scientists found that, perhaps not surprisingly, rural areas struggled to power back up. More than 40 percent of long-lasting power outages occurred in rural locales despite being home to much smaller populations. By comparison, just 29 percent of the long-duration outages were in urban areas, places that are largely more wealthy. The lack of light in the countryside is what drove Puerto Rico to have the second-longest blackout ever recorded anywhere in the world. It also neatly illustrates that the poorest suffer the most from climate catastrophe and that inequality is likely to intensify as the planet warms and violent weather becomes more common. With the power out, it wasnt just a question of not being able to watch television, but a question of life and death. According to NASA, areas with prolonged power outages also lacked access to medical resources. A landmark study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government earlier this year found Hurricane Maria led to 2,975 excess deaths on the island, some of which were due to lack of medicine or care. But if the new research shows where governments and Puerto Ricos utility failed during Maria, it also points to opportunities for how to improve disaster response and preparedness for the next storm. By visualizing where the outages lasted the longest, utility crews could pre-position tools or develop plans for how to access and restore power quicker. Ditto for first responders. The maps also reveal where it may make sense to prioritize grid improvements or install community or rooftop solar and battery storage. Ultimately, it will make sense for other cities, states, and countries to take heed, given the weather weve seen over the past year.","It’s been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Yesterday, the National Science Foundation announced that they’ll keep the storied Arecibo telescope running in the wake of the Hurricane Maria damage. The NSF concluded that the best way forward was to collaborate with “new stakeholders” who will both use and maintain the facility, according to the Record of Decision. There could be some potential demolitions of buildings on the site, but funding will continue. “This is great news,” said Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo. “We hope to continue our science at the observatory.” The iconic Arecibo telescope has been struggling financially for many years now. September’s devastating strike from Hurricane Maria could have been the last straw, but the telescope received its repairs and began limited observations once again only a week later. The facility is still running on diesel generators and there’s millions more dollars of fixes required, according to a Nature report. Under this decision, the NSF will decrease funding from $8.2 to $2 million annually over the next five years as it looks for new partners, writes Nature. Arecibo is now the second largest single-dish filled telescope behind the FAST telescope in China, but it can still make observations of rotating neutron stars (a.k.a. pulsars), exoplanets, and even assist with gravitational wave astronomy. And having a second dish is important—scientists feel much more confident about discoveries when two different experiments independently spot the same thing. Mendez was just excited to continue doing science. He said: “I feel that this is a new life.” [via Nature ]","Yesterday, the National Science Foundation announced that they’ll keep the storied Arecibo telescope running in the wake of the Hurricane Maria damage.

ERIKA P. RODRIGUEZ,"Credit Photographs by Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times A group of friends in Guaynabo, P.R., were singing by the light of their cellphones. Days before Christmas, and three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall, parts of the Puerto Rico are still without water, and over a million people are in the dark. Hundreds of residents remain in shelters, unable to return home. Schools that have been able to resume classes are still without power. But in towns around the island, residents are trying to keep holiday traditions alive, despite the circumstances. The group in Guaynabo had arrived at the home of Juan Pablo González for a parranda, a Puerto Rican Christmas tradition that brings friends together to sing carols, usually in the middle of the night. Mr. González’s home was still without power, so people used cellphones and flashlights to see one another and read song lyrics. In Old San Juan, Marta Cirino performed Christmas songs with Caiko y Los del Soberao, an Afro-Puerto Rican music group. The neighborhood is usually crowded with tourists, but on a recent night, it was full of locals who sang and danced to the music. The Eugenio María de Hostos School in Canóvanas has been used as a shelter for weeks, and is currently home to 94 people. Mildred Rodriguez, a resident at the shelter, brought an artificial Christmas tree salvaged from the debris at her home, and decorated it with what she could find. Workers cleaned and decorated the Escuela del Pueblo Trabajador, a Montessori institution near Trujillo Alto. The school decided to continue a decades-long tradition and hold a holiday celebration for the children after parents asked for it. The area has been without power since Hurricane Irma made landfall a few weeks before Maria swept over the island, but the school reopened in early October. In previous years, only one Puerto Rican flag would hang near the Three Kings altar at the school, but this year dozens of flags were integrated in the decoration. The academic director of the school, Marlyn Souffront, wanted to focus on reaffirming the island’s cultural identity.","Large parts of Puerto Rico still don’t have power after Hurricane Maria, but some residents are determined to celebrate Christmas one way or another.",2017-12-22T10:00:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After Surviving Maria, Trying to Keep Holiday Traditions Alive",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/us/hurricane-maria-christmas-puerto-rico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/21/us/00navidad-01/00navidad-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
MICHAEL KIMMELMAN and CHRISTOPHER GREGORY,"People usually opt to preserve their communities and ties to the land, even if it means living in harms way, points out Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at N.Y.U. whose specialty is social resilience. They have seen enough projects go wrong to suspect that theyre better off risking the next big storm and staying home, where at least they have friends and family nearby.
Carmen Ayendez, who lived in Vietnam much of her life, said her father four years ago took up the governments offer of a new home in Sunset Harbor, one of three housing projects built by the municipality of Guaynabo Vietnam straddles Guaynabo, a mostly prosperous district outside San Juan, and the adjacent municipality of Cataño with the purpose of relocating Vietnams residents.
When her father died two days after signing the new lease, Ms. Ayendez took over the house. But shortly after moving, she started waking in the night, unable to breathe.
It turned out the new house was plagued by mold. Ms. Ayendez hasnt been able to get rid of it. When Maria hit, her roof cracked. She was supposed to be safer in Sunset Harbor.
I preferred living in Vietnam, she said. I built my own house there on a piece of land that my dad gave me when I was 19. It was a wooden house. It had bats and worms, but not mold. I had my friends and neighbors. The roof wasnt very secure, but it was home.
To protect its residents from evictions and gentrification, San Juans largest barrio, on the banks of the Martín Peña canal, has been operating as a community land trust for some years. It ensures everyone in the barrio has rights, a stake and a say. The trust has negotiated voluntary relocations where the clogged, polluted and frequently overflowing canal needs to be dredged or widened and homes get in the way.
Evelyn Quiñones, 63, one of the communitys leaders, showed me the house she agreed to move to a few years ago, on a street just outside the barrio. The decision to leave wasnt easy, she said. It made all the difference that the choice to move was hers, the new house was in good shape and that her relocation improved conditions for people inside the barrio.",Hurricane Maria led to a host of new plans to fix island barrios plagued by chronic flooding.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Mr. Ramos faced a skeptical Senate hearing on Tuesday. He told lawmakers that there had been no kickbacks, but acknowledged that the company had long been rife with political patronage, where up to half the employees got their job from an important connection. Mr. Ramos has given various contradictory explanations for why he chose Whitefish over mutual aid agreements with other utility companies, which are customary after disasters. He told The New York Times last month that he preferred Whitefish because he expected the United States Army Corps of Engineers to pay the company, which meant the bankrupt utility would not have to front any of the money for repairs. Under mutual aid agreements, Prepa would have to pay for the work and then seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But Mr. Ramos told legislators on Tuesday that he went with the private contractors because he did not have the resources to find lodging for workers borrowed from other utilities, even though emails released this week by the House Committee on Natural Resources show that Whitefish could not find housing, either. It has been a rough week for Mr. Ramos. On Monday, The New York Times reported that some of the subcontractors Whitefish had hired to do the work — people Prepa could have hired itself — were earning just $42 an hour. At the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Ramos fended off accusations of price gouging. On Wednesday, Mr. Ramos and the governor proudly hailed an important milestone: The company had finally reached 50 percent of its power capacity. Minutes later, a key line failed, again plunging the northern half of the island into darkness. Another line failed on Thursday. Some 58 days after the storm, the grid is generating power at 45 percent of capacity. On Friday, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Ramos had hired a friend who was once implicated in a federal criminal case to help advise the company. Mr. Ramos posted a cheerful technical update in a video on Facebook in which he defended the new hire, whom he described as an experienced electrical engineer. Mr. Ramos quit 20 minutes later.

LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ and CHRISTOPHER GREGORY,"The last time Enrique and Emma were at the Rafael Hernández Airport, the lights were out, A.T.M.s were down and stragglers were trying to escape the island. Now, the terminal was lit and the windows were damp from the air-conditioning. But as the sun began to rise behind the tattered Puerto Rican flags on the winding road to their home, the lingering effects of the hurricane became clear. An airplane hangar was still missing part of its roof. A gas station was closed, its giant metal sign still on the ground. Tarps were strung over dozens of homes. On an island where about 100,000 households remain without power, progress is painfully slow. Engineers were still repairing a crucial dam near Aguadilla that had cracked during the hurricane. As part of the repairs, water service in the area would be rationed, but Enrique and Emma didn’t know that yet. Their two-story home sits just off the island’s longest highway, nestled in an unassuming neighborhood where dog barks and chicken clucks fill the air. The concrete house had been largely spared by the hurricane, but the wooden front door was still split in half. At around 6 a.m., they were received by Omaira’s husband, Alex Martínez, 43, who stayed behind and lives on the first floor. Enrique and Emma live on the second floor, which can only be reached by climbing a winding staircase on the outside of the house.","Five months after Hurricane Maria led them to flee Puerto Rico for New York, Enrique and Emma López returned recently to their home in Aguadilla, a small beach side town on the northwest corner of the island.",2018-03-30T09:00:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Bittersweet Journey Back to Puerto Rico After Maria,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/nyregion/return-to-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/19/nyregion/00puertoreturn1-promo/00puertoreturn1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
FRANCES ROBLES,"The bureaucracy around the housing repairs was so complex that the first repairs did not begin until more than five months after the hurricane. A full year after the September 2017 storm, a New York Times review found that thousands of Puerto Ricans were still living in ruined houses. For many of them, the FEMA money left over after trickling down through so many middlemen hardly made a dent in what they needed. Lisandra Oquendo, who lives in Punta Santiago on Puerto Ricos eastern coast, was told that her house had been approved for $18,000 in FEMA repair funds, and she was stunned at how little was accomplished with the money. The contractors patched up her roof, gave her a generator, replaced more than a dozen broken window crank operators, installed several appliances, two windows and a door, and cleaned mold off the walls. But because her roof is made of concrete, she said, they told her they could not repair it. They said, We dont do paint, we dont do floors, we dont work with cement, she said. So what do you do? Contractors have said that the rates they collect cover a variety of expenses, including shipping fees, workers compensation insurance, vehicle and warehouse rental, taxes and profit. But prices charged for equipment and appliances often bore little relation to what was charged on the retail market, even in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico. According to Department of Housing records, FEMA paid for about 12,400 people to receive generators at a cost of $3,700 each. The 5,500-watt portable devices and supplies they came with cost the contractors about $800 each, other documents show. FEMA paid $666 apiece for new bathroom sinks, but the contractors who actually bought and installed them paid $260 apiece. FEMA paid almost $4 a square foot to repair roofs; the work was done by subcontractors for $1.64 a foot. The deal the Department of Housing signed required smoke detectors in every sleeping area, so each of the 122,000 houses in the program was equipped with the devices, for which FEMA was billed $82 apiece. A receipt reviewed by The New York Times showed that one subcontractor ordered them in bulk from an Ace Hardware store in the city of Aguadilla for $6.99 each. Fifty-eight percent is being taken off the top as overhead and profit from the two contractors above us, said Brandon Padgett, owner of BVP Construction in Houston, which conducted repairs on 52 houses under the program. Is there 58 percent overhead and profit needed to implement this? No, because we are doing 90 percent of the work.","FEMA is spending more than $1 billion on emergency repairs to homes in Puerto Rico damaged by Hurricane Maria, but much of it is going to contractors charging steep markups and overhead.",2018-11-26T10:00:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","$3,700 Generators and $666 Sinks: FEMA Contractors Charged Steep Markups on Puerto Rico Repairs",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/fema-puerto-rico-housing-repairs-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/us/prcontract-promo/prcontract-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Several news organizations, including The New York Times, conducted independent analyses and found that the number of deaths traceable to the storm was probably far higher than the official count of 64. The Times’s review, based on daily mortality data from Puerto Rico’s vital statistics bureau, found that 1,052 more people than usual had died across the island in the 42 days after Maria struck. The analysis compared daily figures for 2017 with an average of figures for the corresponding days in 2015 and 2016. Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. CNN compiled figures from half the island’s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. Methods for counting storm deaths vary by state and locality. In some places, officials include only direct deaths, such as people who drown in storm floodwaters. Puerto Rico’s method is not that restrictive; the medical examiner includes some deaths indirectly caused by a storm, such as suicides. The leading causes of death on the island in September were diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, Puerto Rican government data show. But there was a sharp spike — by 50 percent — in the number of recorded deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection that can be tied to delayed medical care or poor living conditions. Mr. Rosselló had previously said that his government would look into questionably attributed deaths reported by the news media. On Monday he said he welcomed the outside reviews of the death toll, but he cautioned that the government could not adjust its official mortality count based on “statistical analysis.” “Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said. Reviewing the circumstances surrounding each death will require interviewing family members and doctors who signed death certificates to find out if, for example, the heart attack listed as the cause might have been brought on by stress related to the hurricane or might have been fatal because an ambulance could not get through debris-blocked streets to help in time. For weeks after the storm, top leaders of Puerto Rico’s government insisted that its count of the dead was accurate and not significantly low. On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, Héctor M. Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, said he did not think the count would rise by much. Four days later, President Trump visited the island and remarked that the death toll — which officially stood at 16 at the time — was much lower than the 1,833 people who died in 2005 because of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Pesquera has repeatedly said that Puerto Rico hewed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s protocols for counting storm-related deaths, and has urged families to share information with the authorities about any deaths that may be linked to the storm. “We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” Mr. Rosselló said on Monday.

Photo Residents of Bubao with food and supplies delivered by volunteers. After the storm, residents banded together to help one another. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times After the storm, they stepped out of their washed-out houses and began to shovel and sweep and mop even as they waited, forever it seemed, for help to arrive. They worked for days to try to make the town’s main road passable. “It took everyone two weeks,” Ms. Velez said. “They finally sent a tractor to help move all the dirt and debris.” The small kindnesses came daily. A neighbor with bottles of water always made a point of leaving a few at Ms. Velez’s doorstep. A relative with ice, a precious commodity, would give her a bag now and again. In turn, if someone needed a lantern, she handed over one of hers. Mothers cared for each other’s children and took turns waiting in lines at banks and gas stations. Teachers clambered into the bed of pickup trucks and traveled as far as they could along muddy, washed-out roads to check on their students. Ms. Torres had been saved by two neighbors as floodwaters filled her home. She was dazed and could not get out, so the men had lifted her through a window. Around the island, doctors have teamed to make forays into hard-to-reach towns in the interior, jumping in cars and sport utility vehicles with whatever supplies they could muster. In Humacao, a municipality on the eastern shore where Hurricane Maria snapped sturdy trees in half like pretzel rods and flooded entire neighborhoods, teachers showed up at school the next day, unbidden. Fallen trees covered the courtyard. Mud caked the hallways and classrooms. They put on gloves and started to haul away branches. Eventually, cafeteria workers served up thousands of meals for the homebound and others in Humacao. In the distance, several weeks after Maria, mountains that had looked brown and stripped of life after the hurricane now glowed green. “We will put fruit trees over there, and plants there,” said Carmen Gisela Rodriguez, a teacher in Humacao, envisioning a tableau of shade and plenty in the school courtyard. Her eyes welled up. “Amid all this grew a culture of sharing.” Photo Pirulo, a salsa musician who stayed on the island during the storm, handed out supplies in Bubao. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Ms. Velez said optimism had sometimes slipped away from her amid so many unsolvable questions: Where to find food. How to cook the food. Where to wash clothes. How to fix the gate, remove the mold, rebuild her back rooms. Suicidal thoughts came and went, she said. But she smiled and clasped her cheeks in astonishment when Tito El Bambino and a well-known salsa musician, Pirulo, his dreadlocks bouncing off his back, walked along the street and right up to her. Her son whipped out his iPhone, and she basked in their attention. “This helps us so much — so much,” Ms. Velez said. “To feel we are not abandoned.” Tito, who helped popularize reggaeton, which combines rap with Latin rhythms, and Pirulo made deliberate decisions to stay in Puerto Rico during and after the hurricane, knowing their visibility would draw attention and donations to some of the most desperate pockets of the island. Not long after the storm cleared the island, Pirulo left his apartment in Old San Juan and joined a brigade of doctors going house to house. He helped evacuate elderly residents. Then he started bringing food and water to other marginalized neighborhoods, something he did for weeks. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Tito became the public face of the distribution caravans. He joined forces with Alberto E. de la Cruz, the chief executive of Coca-Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers who organized caravans of his company’s trucks to ferry food and water to some the island’s most neglected towns. Volunteers distributed the goods door-to-door as music boomed and people danced. Mr. de la Cruz helped persuade the Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Guard to join the line of trucks. Residents felt like Christmas had come when the caravans rumbled into their town. Tito and Pirulo posed for countless selfies. They hugged and cried and listened. Pirulo grabbed bags of food and headed up a hill to knock on doors. Tito handed money for milk to a young mother with a baby perched on her hip. The residents of Bubao said they had gotten little help from the government; the municipal mayor had yet to show up weeks after the hurricane, they said. As Pirulo and Tito walked by, one man held up a sign that said, “No Te Vayas. Puerto Rico Te Necesita,” meaning, “Don’t Leave. Puerto Rico Needs You.” “A hug is sometimes worth more than a can of sausages,” Pirulo said. “People go through a disaster like this and it’s the people — el pueblo — who end up helping each other. That’s how we get by.” Continue reading the main story","Since Hurricane Maria steamrollered Puerto Rico, the day-to-day job of digging out, sometimes block by block, has fallen largely to island residents.",2017-12-17T12:00:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Utuado Journal: Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Small Gesture at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-tito-el-bambino.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/16prjournal1/16prjournal1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
SHERI FINK,"Those conditions, he said, made clearer why the government’s official death count was incomplete. “Even if they were really doing a good job, it was really hard unless you did something like we did — go talk to people on the ground,” he said. People, he added, “died alone in their houses. Nobody went there. Some of them were covered by a landslide, and months after they’ve not recovered the bodies.” Notably, abnormally high death rates continued at least through the end of December. “They didn’t show any sign of coming down in the several months following the hurricane that we were looking at,” said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the study’s other senior author. “There is clearly an excess mortality, and let’s not argue very specific numbers,” said Dr. Gilbert Burnham, a professor of international health and founder of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the research, but has performed similar studies assessing deaths, including in Mosul, Iraq. Dr. Burnham said that despite the study’s limitations, including the difficulty of estimating Puerto Rico’s total population in light of migration, and the possible oversampling of smaller populations in more remote areas, such surveys “should become a standard activity in post-disaster situations,” because they help reveal vulnerabilities that can be addressed to save lives. Dr. Burnham and another expert unaffiliated with the study agreed with the researchers that the toll could be even higher than estimated if adjusted for the fact that people who died alone could not be surveyed. “It just is stunning how poor our information was as to what was happening in Puerto Rico,” said Leslie Roberts, a professor and director of the program on forced migration and health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. The use of surveys to assess the extent of deaths and suffering in disasters, and to guide improvements, extends back decades. Particularly important were a series of studies in Bangladesh in 1970 and 1971, which revealed that women died at a higher rate than men from a massive cyclone that the researchers estimated killed at least 224,000 people. In Puerto Rico, the researchers visited 104 barrios across the island, selecting them to ensure that both urban and nonurban areas were represented. In the areas most remote from cities, about one in five residences were abandoned. The researchers chose households at random in each of the barrios, asking about deaths in the home, deaths in the neighborhood, and access to electricity, running water and phone service.",The number of people who died because of Hurricane Maria last year has been a matter of debate.

Rayne Ellis,"Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month. Since the island's long recovery began, the government and independent institutions have worked to figure out exactly how many lives were taken by the effects of the extreme storm. SEE ALSO: We may never see a hurricane season worse than the one that brought us Katrina Today, we have a new, better estimate — and it’s more than 46 times the old one. According to a new study released by George Washington University (GW), 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane. The government of Puerto Rico now accepts that number as an accurate death toll, updating their previous official estimate of 64. A group of workers repair a gravestone damaged by Hurricane Maria in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The GW group teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health to analyze death certificates and other mortality data collected from September 2017 to February 2018. They found that the number of deaths during that time were uncharacteristically high, when compared to that same time period from other years. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups – those in lower income areas and the elderly – faced the highest risk,” lead investigator Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in statement on Tuesday. In fact, the study found that in the poorest communities, the risk of dying increased 60 percent in the wake of Hurricane Maria. And the risk of dying increased 35 percent for older Puerto Rican males. This means that though the exact causes of death may be varied or unclear, in the six months after Hurricane Maria, more people died than usual. This kind of statistical analysis allows researchers to say that the hurricane left groups of people extremely vulnerable after the storm, even if the flooding rains and wind didn't explicitly kill these individuals. Broken headstones pile up in a cemetery in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images Researchers and journalists alike have long speculated that Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64 was suspiciously low. Back in 2017, a New York Times investigation estimated that the death toll was around 1,052 — nearly 1,000 more than the original calculation. This led the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Roselló, to commission an independent study looking into the death toll in February 2018. “It is of great interest to the State to identify how many lives were lost due to the passage of Maria through the Island,"" Roselló said in a statement announcing the effort. ""It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” In early July, researchers at Harvard released a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which estimated that an excess of 4,500 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria by surveying more than 3,000 houses. Then in late July, the Puerto Rican government quietly acknowledged that the death toll was likely much higher than 64, after releasing a 400-page document that put the toll at more than 1,400 people. The government waited for the GW study to officially update the death toll. Broken tree branches pile up as workers push to clear out cemeteries in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The newest count puts Hurricane Maria in second place as the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, behind the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which reportedly took 6,000 lives or more. Aside from the official death toll, the study also provided recommendations to Puerto Rico’s local government and the U.S. federal government to better prepare for the next deadly storm. The study suggests a more efficient way to tally deaths after disasters, a fully staffed Department of Health, better intra-department communication, and other recommendations. “The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” co-author Lynn R. Goldman said. “If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.”","Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Photo Soldiers with the National Guard of Puerto Rico delivered water to residents in Utuado in October. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times The Federal Emergency Management Agency never intended to end food and water assistance to Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a spokesman said, and will continue providing it to Hurricane Maria survivors as needed. Reports this week that the agency had said it planned to cut off aid distribution to the storm-ravaged island had alarmed policymakers in Washington and Puerto Rico. The spokesman, William Booher, said the Jan. 31 date was mistakenly publicized by the agency in a National Public Radio interview published on Monday. According to Mr. Booher, Wednesday was not an actual cutoff, but rather an internal planning date to evaluate if Puerto Rico could still justify needing assistance. “This aid is not stopping,” Mr. Booher said in an interview. “There was no, and is no, current plan to stop providing these commodities, as long as there continues to be an identified need for them.” The confusion marks the latest blot in the federal government’s response to Maria, which was widely criticized as too small and too slow. More than four months after the storm, nearly a third of Puerto Rican power utility customers are still without electricity, and the island’s financial position remains shaky. Mr. Booher insisted on Wednesday that FEMA was not backtracking on its food and water aid plans in response to public criticism. Had the agency planned to end the assistance, it would have required giving notice to the Puerto Rican government, Mr. Booher noted, which said in a statement on Tuesday that it had been blindsided by the prospect of a cutoff.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Prepa still needs to complete repairs to five critical transmission lines, 12 damaged substations and three transmission centers that are needed for grid stability and redundancy, said Gil Quiniones, the chief executive of the New York Power Authority, which has helped in Puerto Rico’s recovery. “The No. 1 goal was to get electricity back as quickly as possible,” Mr. Quiniones said. “On the one hand, there’s lots of new stuff. On the other hand, the crews and other contractors really rushed the work to put it back together.” Michael Byrne, the federal disaster recovery coordinator for Puerto Rico, said the utility’s task now is to design and build a resilient distribution and transmission system that can better withstand problems large and small. “We’ve been flying helicopters all over this island for 11 months now, stringing new lines and putting new towers in,” Mr. Byrne said. “So the level of effort has been historic. But that was just to patch back together what was there.” Just after the governor of Puerto Rico announced in November that the power authority had gotten back to 50 percent of its former electricity generation, the island suddenly went dark, in one of what would be a series of wide blackouts in the months following the Sept. 20 storm. Just last week, the power went out again in large swaths of San Juan. Asked to describe the island’s power grid, Mr. Byrne said, “It’s stable, but fragile.”","Jazmín Méndez’s home in Ponce, P.R.

MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"Hurricane Maria has been the one real test of presidential leadership Trump has faced. We can see the results. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Trump was busy tweeting insults from his New Jersey golf club and campaigning in a special election in Alabama. When he did engage, he praised his administration’s response and complained that Puerto Ricans weren’t doing enough to help themselves. Experts acknowledge that Hurricane Maria would have challenged any president. “The basic model for a FEMA response is that the state and local authorities lead, and FEMA comes in to support their recovery effort,” Jeremy Konyndyk, who headed U.S.A.I.D.’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under Barack Obama, told me. In Puerto Rico, where the whole island had been devastated, that was impossible. But it’s precisely because FEMA isn’t set up to handle situations like Puerto Rico that we needed a capable president. “When a government agency needs to do something it is not designed to do, it takes a lot of very disciplined, rigorous White House leadership” to make it happen, Konyndyk said. As an example, he mentions the Obama administration’s successful response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Neither U.S.A.I.D., the Centers for Disease Control, nor the military was equipped to address it alone. “It’s very easy in that instance for a government agency to just default to doing things the normal way,” Konyndyk said. In such circumstances, someone with a big picture view needs to figure out innovative ways to marshal America’s resources. Trump will never be that someone. And Hurricane Maria is highly unlikely to be the last grave emergency to happen on his watch. Experts are predicting another bad hurricane season this year, though not as terrible as 2017. As Konyndyk points out, every president since Ronald Reagan has had to deal with some sort of novel disease outbreak, including H.I.V., SARS and avian flu. Other, unforeseen calamities will take us by surprise. And we have a president that cannot sit through a briefing or do serious preparation of any kind, who has hollowed out the government and filled key posts with lackeys and grifters. Puerto Ricans have been the first American citizens to really feel what it means to have a president who is so wildly unable to fulfill his responsibilities. It’s hard to imagine they’ll be the last.","Shoes representing Hurricane Maria's victims on display in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",2018-06-08T10:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Price of an Incompetent President,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/opinion/trump-fema-speech.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/opinion/08goldbergWeb/08goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1

"CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, JIM TANKERSLEY and WHITTEN SABBATINI","But nothing happened. And in 2016 Mr. Ledbetter, along with a narrow plurality of voters in Knox, voted for Mr. Trump. “The one thing he kept keying on was bringing jobs,” he said. “The jobs going away is what tore this county apart. Jobs might bring it back.” Had anything changed here since 2016? No, he said. Not yet. But it would take time, he said, and the fact that the economy elsewhere, in wealthier places, is doing so well means the benefits would eventually trickle down to here. “They can only build so much,” he said. Knox County officials say they have stopped looking for deliverance in the landing of a Maytag-size factory, a “moonshot,” and frankly they are a bit tired of hearing about those years. They said the future is in smaller manufacturing companies, new industries and local entrepreneurs, anything that would keep the brightest young people from leaving, as they almost all do. Officials see signs of a turnaround in the flurry of new retail — a Kohl’s, a Love’s travel station, a Kay Jewelers — in the bustling boutique restaurants downtown and, for the first time in many years, in a haul of tax revenues in Galesburg that outpaced city expenses. “There’ll be a group of people always that want to go back to the good old days of the 1920s or the 1880s or whatever,” said John Pritchard, the mayor of Galesburg, who insists that the Labor Department figures about Knox County are simply wrong. “But the reality is I think most people are feeling better about how things are moving. It’s just a challenge to keep people here.” Marisa Miller, 23, who plans to be a physician assistant, was sitting in her car in the vast parking lot of the old mall, where the last department store was having an out-of-business sale. Her parents worked at Maytag and her grandparents worked at the Butler factory that closed down in 2005. “Honestly we’re bringing new places here,” she said of the stores opening in the other parts of town. “But we’re seeing other places leave.” Ms. Miller said she was not surprised that economic revival had not yet washed over her town. She hadn’t expected Mr. Trump to bring one in the first place, she said. The only thing that had changed since the election seemed to be that certain people around town were angrier. As soon as she can, Ms. Miller said, she plans to leave town herself.","Jazmín Méndez’s home in Ponce, P.R.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The U.S. government says 62 people in Puerto Rico have officially died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Not many people are buying that given the island’s lack of electricity, healthcare access, and clean drinking water. To account for this discrepancy, media outlets have been making an extra effort to uncover the true extent of death on the island. Their conclusion? That 62 should be closer to 1,000. Publications like Latino USA and The New York Times released their own analyses on Thursday and Friday, respectively, after looking at how mortality data in September and October from the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico compares to 2015 and 2016. The Times found that 1,052 more people died than usual. The numbers are especially high on the days immediately following September 20, when Maria hit the U.S. territory. Cities like Manatí, Jayuya, and Aguadilla saw some of the highest death rates. In September, the island saw a major spike in deaths from sepsis, an extreme body response to infection that attacks tissue, which the Times attributes to delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals. Puerto Rico has been dealing with a range of health care crises since the hurricane, and getting people proper, timely treatment has been a challenge. The leading causes of death were diabetes and Alzheimer’s. As Times reporter Frances Robles noted on Twitter, insulin is supposed to be refrigerated. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the drug can lose its effectiveness when exposed to extreme temperatures. And Puerto Rico was in the 90s after the storm. The Puerto Rican government can keep blaming this rise on coincidence, but advocates, lawyers, and physicians are taking matters into their own hands. A delegation of more than 30 people in Washington, D.C., on Thursday presented a petition before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to address the human rights issues on the island post-Maria. Among the requests? That the commission halt fiscal austerity measures the U.S. has imposed on Puerto Rico due to its debt crisis, as well as the repeal of a federal law— PROMESA —passed to aid with the crisis. The commission likely won’t respond for another few days, but Commission President Margarette May Macaulay did note the commission would send a formal request for the United States to conduct an on-site visit to Puerto Rico as soon as possible next year. This came after the commission heard testimony after testimony about life on the island. More than two months since the hurricane hit the island, things should be getting back to normal, right? However, many of these U.S. citizens are still struggling to find normalcy and the island isn’t even meeting 70 percent of its energy output. Those who testified talked about coal ash contamination in the South, which they’ve received no update about from the government. They don’t know for sure whether a five-story-high coal ash pile has leaked into their water supply— but they do know the government did nothing to prevent that. The pile was left uncovered during Hurricane Maria. They discussed the exacerbated poverty their pueblos are seeing after the hurricane, as well as the ongoing inability from local hospitals to help their sick relatives. “It would be good for us to wake up and smell the roses instead of smelling chemicals.” “We have a problem in Puerto Rico, and it’s one of discrimination,” said Annette Martínez Orabona, director of the Caribbean Institute for Human Rights, in Spanish, her voice breaking. “It’s about discrimination that stems from our colonial relationship because we haven’t been given the opportunity to practice our right to self-determine, and that should remain clear.” The commission heard what both sides had to say, but Puerto Rican officials didn’t send a representative to attend the meeting alongside other U.S. government reps. Maybe they’re too busy trying to update the official death toll? Macauley was obviously curious herself about this, asking why. Interim Permanent Representative at the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States Kevin Sullivan, the only U.S. official to speak during the hearing, wouldn’t elaborate why not a single Puerto Rican official could attend this human rights hearing. He simply said they reached out to ask Puerto Rican officials for input and received a letter, which wasn’t read. “It is very unfortunate that these things are happening, which we call natural disasters, but which are, in fact, man-made because we’ve destroyed our world. And we continue to do so,” said Macaulay, as she closed out the meeting. “It would be good for us to wake up and smell the roses instead of smelling chemicals.”","The U.S. government says 62 people in Puerto Rico have officially died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"For Mr. Rosselló, the funding fight is a question of fairness. For every long-term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria, there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey, and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the governor said. Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States.
A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long four months for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid (about $1 billion) as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida, though Maria was stronger and more devastating. Maria killed an estimated 2,975 people in Puerto Rico.
In addition to the slow disbursement of aid, a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants, including $20 billion approved for Puerto Rico.
In Vieques, with the hospital out of commission, dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm. Several patients died. Finally, in November, a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic, allowing local treatments to resume.
It wasnt easy, said Edwin Alvarado Cordero, a 58-year-old diabetic. Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the islands two towns, Mr. Alvarado recounted his thrice-weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao, which began at 4 a.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m.
Last year, on the ferry to the big island, Mr. Alvarado suffered a heart attack. He had open-heart surgery and survived. Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques, he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist. Specialists visit Vieques infrequently.
Its far, but its better there, Mr. Alvarado said. Whats left of the hospital here is grass and horses. They abandoned it.","Almost a year and a half after Hurricane Maria, the hospital on the island of Vieques remains closed, with roosters and wild horse droppings littering the empty parking lot and ambulance bay.",2019-04-07T20:19:48Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hungry People and an ‘Abandoned’ Hospital: Puerto Rico Waits as Washington Bickers,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/us/puerto-rico-trump-vieques.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/07/us/00PUERTORICO2/00PUERTORICO2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
"CHARO HENRÍQUEZ, JOE COSCARELLI, MICHAEL PAULSON and JENNIFER SCHUESSLER","Ms. Acevedo is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, where she directs two a cappella choirs: the University of Puerto Rico Chorus, a student group, and Coralia, made up of students and alumni. This year, from February to June, the students in both groups decided to spend Saturdays singing in hurricane-damaged towns. After the hurricane, I came to Miami for four weeks because of the devastation. I live in a condo that was fully flooded, and my front door was partially lost, but actually I consider myself extremely lucky — it’s not a big deal when I saw what people were going through. When I got back, I thought we needed to do something to help our community, so we came up with this project, Canta y Siembra (Sing and Sow), where we went to different municipalities, presented a formal concert with our academic classical repertoire and our lighter repertoire. We’d hand out supplies — clothing, food, water, bed linens, insect repellent, you name it, we just had a little bit of everything — and then we’d finish our visit planting trees, because we lost so many during the hurricane. The first one we went to was Morovis. Part of the road leading up the mountain was missing, but we were able to get there. There was no light, no electricity, and they didn’t have much water, but just being there, presenting the concert, was really kind of a spiritual cleansing for a lot of them. People would come up to us crying, saying thank you for caring about us. A lot of people just needed company — someone to talk to them, someone to listen to them, someone where they could just spill out what they were going through. It was such a growing experience for all of us. A lot of my own students lost their homes, lost their roofs, lost their cars, and yet they were there singing for all these other communities and towns. It was just amazing. The students learned so much about giving back — maybe your own situation is tough, but look at what these people are going through. We don’t deal in politics — we’re in the arts, and the arts is, for me, one of the strongest ways for you to communicate a message. Our message is one of a certain amount of peace, but also of hope — you’re not alone, we are a community, and we will be here for one another regardless. Some of the music is very profound, it’s very spiritual, and a lot of it is thinking about the possibilities: Yes, we went through incredible devastation, but we will prevail. — MICHAEL PAULSON","""Paradox of the New Landscape III"" is one of the works created by Rogelio Baez-Vega during a residency this year at Mass MoCA to help Puerto Rican artists affected by Hurricane Maria.",2018-09-20T08:00:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Creativity From the Chaos of Hurricane Maria,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/arts/creativity-from-the-chaos-of-hurricane-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/23/arts/23hurricane-culture-oak-vega2/23hurricane-culture-oak-vega2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
"John D. Sutter and Leyla Santiago, CNN","San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico, according to an academic report published Tuesday in a prestigious medical journal. That figure dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64, which the article's authors called a ""substantial underestimate"" of Hurricane Maria's death toll. ""These numbers... underscore the inattention of the US government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" authors from Harvard University and other institutions wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The official death toll in Puerto Rico has been the subject of substantial controversy since Hurricane Maria hit this island, a US territory, on September 20. CNN and other news outlets have used government statistics and extensive interviews with families of the deceased and funeral home directors to question the Puerto Rican government's official tally of deaths. Previous estimates suggested Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. The team from Harvard arrived at its much-higher estimate by surveying 3,299 randomly chosen households across the island earlier this year. Authors compared results of that survey -- which asked island residents about deaths in their homes, among other things -- with official mortality statistics from 2016. That allowed researchers to estimate the number of deaths that likely occurred as a result of Hurricane Maria between the date of the storm and December 31, 2017. ""The difference is that we went out and we had boots on the ground and we did the interviews,"" said Domingo Marqués, an associate professor of clinical psychology at Carlos Albizu University in Puerto Rico, who was among the report's authors. ""Statistically, it's like having interviewed the whole island,"" he said. Still, the exact death toll is likely to remain a mystery. Experts tell CNN it is difficult to say with certainty whether a hurricane ""caused"" certain deaths, especially those that occurred because of the chaotic and unsafe conditions that have lingered for months in Puerto Rico. Marqués and colleagues say 793 to 8,498 hurricane deaths occurred. In a news conference on Tuesday, Hector Pesquera, head of Puerto Rico's public safety department, said the government did not have reason to question the latest estimates, which come from researchers at Harvard University as well as Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the University of Colorado and universities in Puerto Rico. US territory officials stressed that the Puerto Rican government has hired George Washington University to conduct an assessment of Maria's death toll and that the results of that review are still forthcoming. Previously, officials had expected the George Washington University report to be released this spring, before the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins on June 1. ""The Government of Puerto Rico welcomes the newly released Harvard University survey and we look forward to analyzing it,"" Carlos R. Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in a press release. ""As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported. That is why we commissioned The George Washington University to carry out a thorough study on the number of fatalities caused by Hurricane Maria which will be released soon. Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost."" The Harvard study says the Puerto Rican and US governments did not provide adequate services -- including electrical power and medical assistance -- after the hurricane. It also notes that Puerto Rican officials have refused to make public basic mortality statistics. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees disaster recovery, has said it encountered unique logistical challenges on the island after the storm that make comparisons between the response to Maria and other storms problematic. CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in Puerto Rico are suing the island's demographic registry for access to death records that have been withheld. In November, CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes -- about half the total -- across Puerto Rico, in a moment when many communication systems remained inoperable. At that time, funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. Puerto Rico added at least two people to its official count following CNN's investigation. One was Quintín Vidal Rolón, 89, who died in a lantern fire that relatives said occurred because of the storm; Vidal was using the lantern because he didn't have electricity. Other uncounted deaths occurred in environments where people lacked electricity or other basic services, including communications. Many roads were blocked after the storm. And hurricane-related deaths appear to have continued for months after the September hurricane. Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, 77, for example, died in Maunabo, Puerto Rico, in January. His family says that's because they couldn't afford to power a breathing machine that helped keep him alive. While most power and water service has been restored, thousands of people here remain without electricity -- more than eight months after Hurricane Maria. The latest death-toll estimate could be seen as an indictment of the federal response to the storm, said Dr. Gregory J. Davis, director of the University of Kentucky's Forensic Pathology Consultation Service. ""This alone should make your readers and the readers of the New England Journal really stand up and take notice -- and frankly be asking our government 'Why?' "" he said. ""Our government is not doing what they should be doing down there. It's infuriating, that's the bottom line."" The New England Journal of Medicine article adds to ""a growing consensus that deaths have been undercounted by the Puerto Rican government,"" said Alexis Santos, a demographer at Penn State University who also has researched the death toll following Maria. ""This is a valid way of looking at it,"" he said of the research from Harvard. Still, ""The way this is done, by interviews with people in different barrios in Puerto Rico, it seems to me that someone could report a death as associated with the hurricane when it was not."" That could result in an overcounting of deaths, he said. The Harvard team, meanwhile, says that, if anything, its estimates are low. It would be impossible to identify some deaths using a survey, Marqués said. For example, if a person died while living alone there would be no person in that home able to answer questions. Researchers also underscored how much an accurate death toll matters -- in terms of supplying adequate assistance, for the families of victims and for the prevention of future deaths. ""As the United States prepares for its next hurricane season,"" the researchers wrote, ""it will be critical to review how disaster-related deaths will be counted, in order to mobilize an appropriate response operation and account for the fate of those affected.""","An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico, according to an academic report published Tuesday in a prestigious medical journal.

Brett Williams,"It's been nearly two months since Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, and the island is still in the midst of a long road to recovery. While most of its people have gained access to potable water, more than 25 percent of Puerto Rico is still without reliable telecommunications service, cutting them off from the outside world. Google's parent company Alphabet is trying to help return connection for the people of Puerto Rico. Project Loon, the aerial internet endeavor from the X innovation lab, was given FCC permission and began launching its LTE-beaming balloons over the island last month. After a few weeks of service, Alphabet says the efforts have paid off. Project Loon's reps claim the balloons have been able to bring basic internet connectivity to more than 100,000 people in Puerto Rico. SEE ALSO: Tesla installs Powerpack and Powerwall batteries at hospital in Puerto Rico The Loon team joined forces with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile for the efforts, which sends the balloons some 65,000 feet in the air to create a network that relays LTE signals to telecom partners on the ground below (in this case, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). People on the ground can then access the internet using LTE-connected devices. This augmented connectivity is essential for those who haven't yet regained access to normal communications, so the project's effectiveness has been extremely important. There's still much work to begun to bring Puerto Rico back up to full strength, so hopefully, special projects like Loon can continue to serve as a temporary reprieve as larger recovery efforts are undertaken.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""A lofty idea becomes reality."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QTngSsCMz6ThXNcOTF7fLyie_qc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F10%2F92c3c739-4c4b-2b31%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg"",""mediaid"":""YxlJrBXl98"",""prelo…",2017-11-09T21:42:37Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Google: Project Loon has provided internet access to 100,000 people in Puerto Rico",http://mashable.com/2017/11/09/project-loon-puerto-rico-progress/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Msnq9tdHgYKLzZyxirrsev2L1OI=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F09%2F5a%2Fb2578c6ea7904071804e80cf6ca540d4.d78f4.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Hurricane Maria,1
"Ray Sanchez, CNN","Puerto Rico's emergency management director Abner Gómez's resignation is effective Saturday Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, appointed by Pentagon to lead military relief efforts, leaves island next week (CNN) Puerto Rico's emergency management director resigned Friday as the island's slow recovery continues nearly two months after Hurricane Maria made landfall. In announcing the resignation of Abner Gómez, effective Saturday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló praised the work of his emergency management chief following the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in early and later September. The governor also announced that Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who was appointed by the Pentagon to lead all military relief efforts, will be reassigned outside the island next week. About 60% of the US territory is still without power as the island's approximately 3.4 million US citizens struggle through the aftermath of the storm. A massive power outage struck the capital of San Juan on Thursday after a major north-south transmission line failed, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA. No reason given for resignation Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, will take over emergency management duties. Rosselló did not give a reason for Gómez's resignation. The emergency management director came under fire after the island's El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported that Gómez took a two-week vacation shortly after Maria made landfall on September 20. Buchanan, a three-star star general and commander of US Army North (5th Army), arrived in Puerto Rico in late September as the military was tasked with improving distribution networks of relief supplies. 'We've moved out of the crisis' ""The cessation of General Buchanan's work does not mean that the military is leaving,"" Rosselló said in a statement. ""His departure marks a positive transition. We have not finished the recovery, but there is progress in the missions that have been carried out."" Buchanan will be replaced by a two-star general, according to the governor. ""From my perspective, we've moved out of the crisis,"" Buchanan told reporters. ""We're moving out of response and most places are moving on towards recovery... FEMA is going to be here for very much the long term and the rebuilding effort, and we in the military generally don't do that."" The changes come as the island's government faces questions about the official death toll of 55 from the massive storm. Government officials acknowledged this week that nearly 500 more people died in Puerto Rico in September than in the same month the previous year. An official with Puerto Rico's forensics institute told reporters that 472 more people died this September than in the same month in 2016 -- up from 2,366 to 2,838. Wanda Llovet, director of the Demographic Register, said there were about 82 deaths a day reported from September 1 through September 19, compared to some 117 per day during the last ten days of the month. ""We are not going to say there could be more or less,"" Pesquera, whose oversees the count, said of hurricane-related fatalities. ""We've quantified the number of deaths."" Pesquera has staunchly defended government efforts to generate an accurate count under extremely trying conditions: most lines of communication were cut and many roads on the island were initially impassable.

Nick Stockton,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump flew to Puerto Rico, toured a relatively affluent neighborhood there, and expressed his relief that the storm had not been “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. He jokingly chided Puerto Ricans for throwing the federal budget a “little out of whack.” In reality, Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, and the federal disaster response on the island was, at that point, a fraction of what residents of Florida and Texas had received during the same hurricane season. The government of Puerto Rico recently published a report estimating the storm's death toll at 1,427 people, more than 20 times the previous estimate. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the storm and its aftermath ultimately killed more than 4,000. If the federal government’s response to Maria was a scandal, the tech industry’s initial reaction seemed, comparatively, like a source of hope. In the days after the disaster, a small groundswell of private tech enthusiasm furthered the notion that Puerto Rico ought to become a test bed for renewable, distributed, climate-­resilient infrastructure. Companies like Alphabet and Tesla, which were already working on the island, looked like they might be poised to make this idea a reality. Later, a different set of tech entrepreneurs descended on Puerto Rico as well, enticed by tax breaks to advance other, more esoteric techno-​utopian visions. Here’s a progress report on how tech has, and hasn’t, managed to come to Puerto Rico’s rescue. Alphabet For years, Alphabet’s X (formerly known as Google X) has been working on a project called Loon, which provides cell service to remote areas via giant balloons. And it just so happened that one of the company’s two launch facilities for those signal-­slinging balloons was located in Ceiba, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast. So the company deployed a handful of the floating antennas, blanketing the island with text and data service for more than 250,000 customers of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T for four months while parts of the electrical grid were down. Tesla Two weeks after the storm, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla had a track record of building decentralized electrical infrastructure—independent solar and battery systems—on small islands. “There is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” Since then, updates have come mostly in the form of more tweets. In April, Musk reported that “Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico.” Then in June he tweeted, “We have about 11,000 projects underway” on the island. Tesla has declined to clarify what that means or how many Puerto Ricans are served by those projects. The Blockchain Crowd Over the past year, about 150 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have settled on the island, according to Giovanni Mendez, a tax lawyer who has helped many of them. They’ve been drawn in part by incentives, passed in 2012, that give tax exemptions for capital gains and passive income to individuals who spend at least half their year on the island, and by an amendment, passed just months before Hurricane Maria, that eased requirements on US companies to hire Puerto Rican residents. One of the new arrivals was the cryptocurrency guru and former child actor Brock Pierce, who promptly said he was setting out to build a utopian community—perhaps even a whole new city—on the island, to the ire of many Puerto Ricans.

FRANCES ROBLES,"“We don’t want to spend the rest of our lives in hotels,” Mr. Santiago said. “We’re not asking FEMA to support us, just to help us until we are more stable. If this has been so hard for me, I can’t imagine what it’s like for the people with little kids or illnesses.” Mr. Santiago moved to Florida in December from Corozal, where his home was destroyed. He is working for a transportation company but not earning enough to afford an apartment. “Every time the deadline approaches, your nerves are shot,” he said. Lawyers for LatinoJustice argued that survivors of past storms had received more help. Hurricane Katrina survivors stayed in hotels for 27 months, Ms. Bannan said. Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven benefit extensions, but Hurricane Maria survivors received just three, the group said. The judge found, however, that those previous storms affected far more people. The governor of Puerto Rico, the judge noted, stopped asking for extensions to the voucher program once a provision under FEMA rules took effect that would have required the government of Puerto Rico to share 10 percent of the housing costs. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FEMA said there are 1,038 families still receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance across 27 states, with about 400 of them in Puerto Rico. “FEMA is working with its vendor and notifying participating hotels that the TSA program has been extended to comply with the court’s order, said Lenisha Smith, a FEMA spokeswoman. “Beyond that, FEMA will not comment on pending litigation.” Although Judge Hillman found that FEMA’s funding of the housing assistance program was “discretionary” and denied the request for an injunction, he urged the government to find a way to help the families.","After months of temporary reprieves, the judge says temporary housing vouchers for victims of Hurricane Maria staying in hotels can be ended on Sept. 13.",2018-08-31T17:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Government Can Stop Paying to House Puerto Rico Hurricane Victims, Judge Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/puerto-rico-fema-housing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/31puerto-print/31puerto-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
Mark Kaufman,"The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017. This number, however, is ""highly uncertain"" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A new study published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine puts that number at an estimated 4,645 — 70 times higher than the official estimate. ""Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,"" write the authors, led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. SEE ALSO: Puerto Ricans never know if they'll have power. This is how they're surviving. NOAA says that the storm, which caused some $90 billion in damage, is the third costliest in U.S. history. But it's the deadliest in over a century, since a hurricane pummeled Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing more than 6,000 people. Back then, both NOAA and the National Hurricane Center didn't exist, so people were largely unaware of the power brought by the coming cyclone. Puerto Rico knew what was coming, but the hurricane's wind and downpours ravaged the island's water system and electrical grid. The storm blew down more than 80 percent of the island's utility poles and transmission lines. ""Practically all cell phone service was lost and municipal water supplies were knocked out,"" said NOAA. While some fatalities were caused by drownings and people being carried away in unprecedented floodwaters, the researchers show that thousands more succumbed during the period between September 20 through December 31, 2017. Around a third of those died due to ""delayed or interrupted health care."" In the U.S., official deaths are documented by medical examiners, and in Puerto Rico, specifically, disaster-caused deaths are confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. This has proven difficult in Puerto Rico, the authors said, because the process often involves taking a dead body to be inspected in the capital. And the storm killed many people indirectly, such as from a lack of medical treatment for chronic disease. It can be challenging for medical examiners to identify such deaths as being cyclone-caused. NOAA satellite GOES-16 captures an image of Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Image: cira/noaa For this reason, the researchers relied upon a survey of 3,299 randomly chosen homes all over Puerto Rico, asking residents about the causes of death and other factors, like whether or not they were forced to leave their houses. Only 7 percent of households involved did not complete the survey. Once the surveys were reviewed, the researchers compared the rate of deaths that occurred between September 20 and December 31 in 2016 and 2017, finding that there were more than 4,500 ""excess deaths"" in 2017 — i.e., deaths that would not have occurred without the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria. ""These numbers will serve as an important independent comparison to official statistics from death-registry data, which are currently being reevaluated, and underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" write the authors. If the official government report approximates this latest estimate by researchers outside the government, it may persuade current and future U.S. lawmakers to address the aftermath of a tropical cyclone more promptly, and with a heightened awareness of the necessary resources. NOAA forecasts the coming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season to be ""active,"" with between five and nine hurricane-level storms.","The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017.

Andrew Freedman,"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history. The notorious storms of 2017 — hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — may have had innocuous names. However, they flooded America's fourth-largest metropolis, cut a swath of destruction across the Caribbean before hitting Florida, and cut off power to the entire island of Puerto Rico, respectively. The costs of the storms that hit the U.S. are still being tallied, with some analysts claiming that it was the most expensive hurricane season on record. Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with the insurance company AonBenfield, said that his company's calculations show that direct damage and business interruption losses from 2017's many storms will put 2017 in second place, behind 2005, once adjusted for inflation. SEE ALSO: San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz talks Puerto Rico's recovery with Stephen Colbert It's possible that ranking will change, however. ""There remains so much uncertainty with the three big storms (Harvey, Irma, Maria), and insurance claims continue to be filed and processed,"" Bowen said via Twitter message. ""A big component to the direct damage losses remains business interruption, and especially in the case of Maria in Puerto Rico, those direct impacts remain ongoing,"" Bowen said. ""The 2017 season is going to end near the top on an economic and insured loss basis once all is said and done. Regardless of what metric is used to determine 2017's ranking... the season was extraordinarily costly and will be used as one of the benchmark years against which future seasons are compared,"" Bowen said. Puerto Rico still has not woken up from the nightmare caused by Hurricane Maria. It's been 71 days since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, but residents there are still struggling without access to electricity, as well as other basic services. As of Thursday afternoon, electricity generation on Puerto Rico — which is not the same as the percentage of people who are receiving power — stood at 65 percent. About 7 percent of Puerto Rican residents are without access to safe drinking water, according to the territory's website. Repairs are still being made to electricity and transportation infrastructure in the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas that in many cases were hit with two major hurricanes in a row. The Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, especially when compared to the mobilization mounted in the wake of other storms that struck the U.S. mainland, is widely viewed to be abysmal. A season of destructive hurricanes Even veteran hurricane forecasters were stunned by the beastly storms that prowled the Atlantic Ocean this season. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 storm, resulted in the heaviest rainstorm ever recorded in the country. The storm inundated large swaths of the Houston metro area, dumping as much as 5 feet of rain over the course of a few days. Such unprecedented rainfall turned highways into raging rivers, flooded petrochemical plants, and destroyed tens of thousands of cars, homes, and businesses. Harvey was followed by another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Irma, marking the first time the U.S. has been hit by two Category 4 storms in the same season. Irma reserved it greatest ferocity for islands in the Caribbean, practically wiping out the island of Barbuda, and stripping the lush vegetation of the Virgin Islands bare. Hurricane Irma remained a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for a consecutive 37 hours, a new world record, and also broke the record for the strongest hurricane observed in the Atlantic outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Based on its windspeed, it also tied for second on the list of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes of all-time, behind Hurricane Allen in 1980. Then came Hurricane Maria, which rapidly intensified on September 18, and also raked parts of the Leeward Islands and Caribbean. Maria caused widespread damage when it hit the tiny island of Dominica as a Category 5 storm, and became the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. The Atlantic season kept setting records into October, when Hurricane Ophelia became the strongest storm to form so far east in the North Atlantic. By reaching Category 3 intensity, Ophelia also became the sixth major hurricane of Category 3 or greater to form during the 2017 season. Hurricane Ophelia underwent a transition into a powerful hybrid, and then a non-tropical storm, that struck Ireland with winds as strong as 119 miles per hour. While the hurricanes of 2017 were fierce, none of the Category 4 or 5 storms hit without extremely accurate warnings. In fact, preliminary data from the National Hurricane Center show that storm track forecasts for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were about 25 percent more accurate than average. Storm intensity forecasts, however, remained a bigger challenge, as some of these storms underwent periods of astonishingly rapid intensification that defied expectations. For millions from Houston to St. Johns, the off season will be spent rebuilding and attempting to get their lives back to normalcy. Meanwhile, hurricane forecasters will work to improve their techniques and computer models in time for next year.","The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history.

JEFFERY C. MAYS,"After Hurricane Maria, Mr. Bonilla, who lived in Toa Baja, P.R., began having trouble breathing. He was taken to a hospital, which ran out of oxygen. At another hospital, the generator providing electricity for his ventilator would shut off occasionally. The official cause of death on his death certificate was sepsis. “In reality, his death was indirectly caused by the hurricane,” Ms. Bonilla said. “The hospitals were not running as usual. These stories cannot be forgotten.” Having an accurate death toll after a natural diaster helps determine the scope of the recovery effort, encouraging new resiliency efforts, while providing families closure and qualifying them for assistance, the Harvard researchers said in explaining their efforts. Jordan Sanchez, who works with the disaster relief agency SBP, said he was worried about the future because Puerto Rico is still struggling with basic tasks at the start of hurricane season, which began on Friday. Mr. Sanchez, who is Puerto Rican and has family members on the island, recently returned from his second trip there since the storm. He said families, especially in more rural areas, are still struggling to obtain power, healthy food and medical care. Normally, the aid relief effort would have already moved to the recovery and rebuilding phase. “Even a strong storm could be devastating,” Mr. Sanchez said. “But we are a resilient people, so I have to remain optimistic.”","Demonstrators at a rally outside the United Nations in Manhattan on Saturday.

Jon Fingas,"As to how the agency would pay for all this? There would be $256 million in truly new funding, but the FCC would turn the advanced funding from 2017 into extra funding by declining to offset that financing against future universal service support payments. It would also repurpose universal service support that was already being directed toward the stricken areas. If the proposal goes forward, it could be helpful in a country whose telecom networks weren't on the cutting edge before Maria struck. With that said, it's not hard to raise questions. Why are longer-term plans only coming up half a year after the hurricane? And wouldn't it be better to offer funding on top of universal service support, rather than replace it?

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery. The hour-long journey follows a roller-coaster-like path of humps and switchbacks through the dense tropical forest on what should be, but is not, a one-way road. Houses remain covered in tarps, awaiting repairs to their storm-ravaged roofs, and at least one sported anti-FEMA graffiti. Though Puerto Rico’s huge, historic observatory survived Hurricane Maria with little damage, its future is now in jeopardy. Recently, the University of Central Florida revealed itself as the leader behind a mysterious consortium that would take over management of the storied telescope—the world’s second-largest single dish. Six months after Hurricane Maria, which killed hundreds of people and left Puerto Rico with widespread power outages that continue today, Arecibo could potentially be in a better place than it was before the storm, as it transitions to new management with more private funding. But there’s work left to be done before the Arecibo is out of the woods. At 1,000 feet wide, Arecibo was the largest single-dish telescope from 1963 until 2016, when it lost its title to the 1640-foot FAST telescope in China. It’s responsible for years of asteroid imaging, exoplanet and pulsar studies, and atmospheric research. It sent the famous Arecibo Message meant for extraterrestrials in 1974. Its observations earned two scientists the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars, a tool that could be used to further study how stars emit gravitational waves. Arecibo appears as alien on the Puerto Rican landscape as the beings it attempted to contact back in the 1970s. Three support towers, all taller than 200 feet, suspend a massive ring with a dome and antennae over the thousand-foot-dish, built into a sinkhole in the area’s hilly topography. It looks like a hidden Cold War-era weapon with its dark, dirty panels, but this doesn’t get in the way of the cutting-edge science conducted there (and the panels are currently getting a cleaning). Its look earned it a spot in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The telescope’s troubles began long before Maria. The federal government discussed budget cuts as early as 2006, reports the Associated Press, as the National Science Foundation has hunted for ways to free up money by letting go of older projects. The NSF previously funded two-thirds of Arecibo’s $12 million budget, as Nature has reported, and has been looking for a way to reduce its contribution. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a category 4 hurricane on September 20, 2017. Much of the island lost power, and hundreds of thousands were still in the dark as of last month. The telescope seemed to weather the storm miraculously, only losing part of one of its instruments, which crashed down into its dish, breaking 30 of the nearly 40,000 reflective aluminum panels that focus radio signals into the telescope’s antennae. But good news came in November: The NSF announced a way forward that wouldn’t require shutting down the observatory. Over the next five years, the NSF would decrease its annual funding from $8.2 million to $2 million, while private backers would take over the rest. More recently, the telescope’s management team announced a restructuring, as a cooperative agreement with managers SRI International, the Universities Space Research Association, and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) was set to end on March 31. Instead, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida, with help from a private company called Yang Enterprises, will take over, with UMET remaining involved. NASA will continue to fund around $4 million of the telescope’s costs per year to support its own research. Next steps for the telescope are fraught. Physics Today reported that all employees will need to reapply for their jobs by the end of this month; that the University of Central Florida doesn’t currently have scientists with the expertise required by Arecibo; and that the consortium is looking for other options for more funding, too, such as partnerships with the Department of Defense (who does fund some science research through programs like DARPA) or arrangements for scientists and agencies to pay to use the telescope. Gizmodo reached out to Francisco Cordova, Arecibo’s director, for comment about the Physics Today article, and we will update the post when we hear back. Then of course, there’s how Arecibo fits into Puerto Rico as a whole. The telescope’s local staff of around 120 was responsible for clearing the roads and ensuring things were back up and running a week after the storm. But the island still faces power outages and its own long road to recovery. Some worry the island is being forgotten. “It’s easy for the government to focus its energy on things that are easy to fix,” planetary radar astronomer Alessondra Springmann from the University of Arizona told Gizmodo. “But it’s also easy for the US to forget.” Back at the telescope, some of the observatory’s users are more optimistic. After all, the future may be hazy, but at least there’s a future. “I think things will get much better,” Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo told Gizmodo. “This is a setback, but with the plan that the observatory is making, that NASA is putting faith in it—I think in the long run, we’ll have a better telescope.”","The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Trump: Puerto Rico hurricane response an ""unsung success"" President Donald Trump has been criticised for hailing the US response to the deadly Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year as ""tremendous"". The mayor of its capital tweeted: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all."" Puerto Rico only finished restoring full power last month, 11 months after the hurricane hit. A recent report says 8% left the island after the hurricane and many died due to poor health care and other services. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. is home to some 3.3 million people. What did the president say? He was asked at the White House what lessons could be learned from Hurricane Maria as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas. Maria, he said, was the ""hardest one we had by far because of the island nature"", adding: ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about. Media caption Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard ""The job that Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and law enforcement and everybody did working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success."" Mr Trump had said recently: ""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done."" What has the response been to his latest comments? The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of Mr Trump who earlier described his response to Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"", said his latest comment ""added ""insult to injury"". Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: ""Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a 'success'. That is a tragedy and a disgrace."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""This is an offensive, hurtful and blatantly false comment from the president."" New York Democratic primary winner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said: ""Some of my [Puerto Rico] family just got power a few weeks ago. People are developing respiratory issues partly due to airborne fungal spores from lack of proper cleanup. The admin's response to Puerto Rico has been a disaster."" Some Trump supporters on social media accepted there had been failures but said the president had done all he could and that it was Puerto Rican officials who were to blame. What happened in Hurricane Maria? Maria made landfall in mid-September last year having just been downgraded to a category four hurricane, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and driving rain. It caused catastrophic damage to the north-eastern Caribbean and was the most intense cyclone worldwide in 2017. Infrastructure was severely damaged in Puerto Rico and the territory struggled to make repairs to the power grid, only completing the work 11 months later. Maria was estimated to have caused $100bn (£77bn) in damage. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.

For long the government there listed the death toll at only 64, although it acknowledged it was probably much higher. The island's authorities finally accepted a revised toll of 2,975 after a government-commissioned report by experts from George Washington University. This counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. The report said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane.","The president called the response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 2,975 on the island, ""tremendous"".",2018-09-11T22:32:13Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trump's claim of success in Puerto Rico hurricane response derided,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45492197,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06kxjs7.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Hurricane Maria,1
MICHAEL TACKETT,"Mr. Long said Peter Gaynor, the deputy administrator, would serve as acting administrator.
Mr. Long earned plaudits for FEMAs response to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2017. Assessing the damage in Texas, President Trump praised Mr. Long as a man who really has become very famous on television in the last couple of days.
But he came under withering criticism for FEMAs handling of relief efforts after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico later that year, including a call last month from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a candidate for president, for Mr. Long to resign.
Hurricane Maria eventually caused almost 3,000 deaths and left thousands without electricity for months, and Hurricane Harvey killed nearly 70 people. Those storms combined with others in 2017 caused an estimated $300 billion in damage.
Mr. Long came to Washington with a strong reputation for skilled handling of disaster management, and White House officials often praised his professionalism. But that standing was undercut by the inspector generals report, which noted that Mr. Long had also used a government vehicle for personal purposes while on a family vacation in Hawaii.
The FEMA administrator is supposed to be focused on preparing for disasters like the devastating hurricanes that killed thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands not using government vehicles to shuttle his family around Hawaii at taxpayer expense, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who was the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and is now its chairman, said when the report was released.","Brock Long, right, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, in South Carolina after Hurricane Florence last year with President Trump and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary.",2019-02-14T00:02:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Brock Long, FEMA Administrator, Resigns After Two Turbulent Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/brock-long-fema.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/arts/14DC-FEMA/14DC-FEMA-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","We’re 10 days out from the 2018 hurricane season, but if a new NASA-led aerial survey is any indicator, Puerto Rico’s forests and wetlands still have a long way to go before they’ve recovered from the last one. In April, a NASA science plane flew across a vast swath of Puerto Rico’s ecosystems, from tropical rainforests in the northeast to dry forests in the southwest. A follow-on to a similar mission conducted last spring, the goal was initially to track long-term forest regrowth after land abandonment. Hurricane Maria changed all that. Instead of focusing on land use change, the research flights—whose G-LiHT instrument system included LiDAR and more—became the first large-scale, multi-sensor aerial survey of the island after the Category 4 storm that struck last September. They survey’s 65,000+ high-resolution images, released online this week, reveal that Puerto Rico’s unique ecosystems are still hurting in a big way. 1 / 6 “Every forest type we observed has clear signs of damage from the hurricane,” Doug Morton, an earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center who participated in the new surveys, told Earther. In a normal year, Morton said, they’d expect about one percent of the forest canopy to have been damaged by windstorms and other natural causes. This year, about 50 percent of the canopy was damaged across much of the 3,000 kilometers of flight lines surveyed. That means a lot more light and heat reaching the forest floor, which, combined with all the foliage blown off trees by the storm, equates to a pulse of energy and nutrients that will help ecosystems recover. “It’s pretty much prime growing conditions,” Morton said, noting that despite the lingering damage, vegetation is clearly bouncing back in many areas. Some spots are taking longer than others, though. The mangrove swamps in the northeast, home to one of Puerto Rico’s famed bioluminescent bays, still seemed incredibly damaged seven months after Maria. “The photos are powerful. [They’re] powerful reminders of the extent of damage.” Part of the goal of the survey was to suss out winners and losers among the vegetation, and learn which ecosystems are most resilient across the island. To that end, the researchers plan to compare notes with various field research groups on the ground in Puerto Rico. Another goal is to offer high-quality aerial imagery and data that will be helpful to land managers involved in the island’s ongoing recovery process. Morton noted that the survey’s LiDAR data, which provides a 3-D look at the forest canopy, can be used to make quantitative estimates of the loss of trees and soil that can help guide planning and recovery. On a more basic level, the survey offers a potent reminder that for the island of Puerto Rico and the American citizens who call it home, the disaster of Hurricane Maria is far from over. “The photos are powerful,” Morton said. “[They’re] powerful reminders of the extent of damage.”","We’re 10 days out from the 2018 hurricane season, but if a new NASA-led aerial survey is any indicator, Puerto Rico’s forests and wetlands still have a long way to go before they’ve recovered from the last one.

It was the first time a late-night show had been broadcast from there. “Of course, tickets for tonight’s show were free, so if you paid for those on the street outside, I’m sorry and welcome to New York City,” Fallon joked. Then he ran down some of the park’s key tourist destinations. “Let’s take a look at this map. First up, here’s the SummerStage. That’s where we are right now.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a monster hurricane spinning towards the east coast, President Donald Trump took a moment during a briefing on Tuesday to herald the awful, delayed response to 2017's Hurricane Maria as an ""unsung success,"" sparking outrage online. Calling it ""one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about,"" Trump is ignoring what was, in fact, a dreadful response that cost more lives than what the storm death toll originally claimed. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. At the time, the administration committed to a more aggressive response to storms that struck Texas, even as that situation there became more manageable and Puerto Rico desperately needed more assistance. But perhaps worst of all is the fact that Trump is using words like ""tremendous"" and ""success"" to describe a response to a storm that ultimately killed almost 3,000 people, more than the roughly 1,800 killed by Hurricane Katrina and about the same number of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As far as Trump's response is concerned, the most lasting image of his involvement with Hurricane Maria will be the time he visited Puerto Rico and threw rolls of paper towels to survivors. As one could imagine, Trump's egregiously tone-deaf statement on Tuesday did not go over well on Twitter. Trump simply does not get it. Thus his neglect towards Puerto Rico cost about 3,000 lives. Unfortunately, it seems he will never get it. — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 11, 2018 Hey @realDonaldTrump : Almost 3,000 Americans died and it took ELEVEN months for your administration to restore power to #PuertoRico.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by George Dvorsky to Gizmodo","Just two weeks have passed since power returned to some communities in the Salinas-Guayama region of Puerto Rico. The Southeast was one of the first places to feel Hurricane Maria’s wrath, and it’s been one of the last to feel a sense of relief. Ruth Santiago has been there for it all. Santiago works as an attorney with El Puente’s Latino Climate Action Network, a Puerto Rico-based initiative dedicated to environmental justice. She lives in Salinas, in the heart of the island’s energy production. Puerto Rico’s Afro-Descendants also concentrate in this region: 18.5 percent live in the municipality of Guayama, according to Census data. After the eye of Hurricane Maria struck the region head-on on September 20th, many residents remain without electricity. Telecommunication services are sporadic, sometimes nonexistent. Santiago was in New York City last week meeting with the New York team of El Puente, so Earther took the opportunity to sit down with her and hear what a day in her life on the island entails under Puerto Rico’s new “normal.” Santiago starts her day early, usually around 5:30 a.m. She lies in bed and stares up at her white ceiling, still tired even though she should feel well-rested. In the weeks after the hurricane, Santiago’s sleep was irregular as the groans of generators kept her up at night. (The media doesn’t call Puerto Rico “ Generator Island ” for nothing these days.) With fewer of her neighbors using generators since power returned, Santiago’s been sleeping better recently. But for the most part, everything still feels out of whack. Santiago’s community has been fortunate to have running water—and she’s grateful—but it’s not the same. Using too much water can lead to low water pressure, so showers have to be quick. They don’t provide the relaxation they once did. Santiago misses the natural soaps she used to buy at an organic market back in Ponce, a 45-minute drive away. The organic market is pretty much bare these days; the hurricane has made little available anymore. Before the power came back, Santiago would usually fill a bowl with cereal for breakfast. Almond milk won’t go bad as quickly as dairy, which is the kind of thing you discover when you can’t keep food in the fridge. Santiago and her husband learned to finish their almond milk in just two days. When Santiago got real sick of eating cereal, she’d head to her go-to bakery in town, La Exquisita. After about 15 to 20 minutes of waiting, she’d buy her pan de agua or pan sobao. When the hurricane first hit, the bakeries weren’t operating the same, if they were open at all. When they did open, close to 50 people would line up in the morning. Now that she’s got power again, Santiago’s fridge works. She can store eggs and cook them for breakfast. Man, does she miss her old meals, though. For breakfast, she’d have toast with eggs and creamy, crumbly quesito blanco with some fruit on the side. Before the power returned, her dinners would consist of tuna fish or other canned goods, so she’d try to eat a hefty lunch while out. Thinking about the fruit and cheese makes Santiago nostalgic. Her markets don’t sell the cheese anymore, and fresh fruits, including bananas, mangoes, and pineapples, are still hard to come by. In fact, the trees that used to grow the bananas and the plantains are gone, too. Santiago used to pass the farms down the road all the time. First, she saw them on the ground, torn down. Now, they’ve been cleared out, and it doesn’t look like they’re being replanted. Santiago can’t imagine any farmers attempting to grow with the rains Puerto Rico’s been seeing. Hurricane Maria was something, but the rains didn’t stop completely after the storm. Some have been torrential. About twice a week, Santiago drives into San Juan for work. She used to just work from home, but without internet, home isn’t much good for work. The drive used to take her an hour; now, it’s usually an hour and a half. The roads are always flooded with cars now. Everyone from the South is trying to find internet access, or heading north for groceries. Her legal work isn’t all Santiago does. On the days she doesn’t head to San Juan, she goes to a community center in Salinas’ El Coquí ward that is helping with relief efforts by providing lunches for the elderly, pampers for babies, water, and even solar lamps. Even before the storm, she’s been sure to be as involved as possible with her southeastern community to protect it from nearby pollution. The region is home to power plants, as well as a giant coal ash mound. After a long day’s work, Santiago returns to her home, which is now lit up with the power that recently returned. Before, it was mostly dark, lit up only by the solar lamps sent to her by her son in Philadelphia. Santiago takes her nightly shower—the second of the day—and prepares for sleep. Now that her power is back, she doesn’t have to turn on her radio anymore to drown out the sounds of generators, or shut off her solar lamp. But she still has to brace for tomorrow. With a shiver and prayer, she shuts her eyes and prepares.","Just two weeks have passed since power returned to some communities in the Salinas-Guayama region of Puerto Rico.

FRANCES ROBLES,"In another section, it said: “According to initial reports, 64 lives were lost. That estimate was later revised to 1,427.” The government was widely criticized for undercounting the number of people who died on the island as the power outage stretched for months, causing deaths from diabetes and sepsis to soar. Many people died from lack of access to hospitals, or because there was no power to run the machines they used to breathe. After a New York Times analysis in December showed that even the preliminary data from the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico indicated that hurricane-related deaths may have risen to 1,052, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló commissioned a study from George Washington University’s school of public health. The report is expected to be released this month. “We definitely acknowledge this is a realistic estimate,” Pedro Cerame, a spokesman for the Puerto Rican government’s Federal Affairs Administration, said of the numbers in the upcoming report to Congress. “We don’t want to say it out loud or publicize it as an official number. The official number will come, and it could be close. But until we see the study, and have the accuracy, we won’t be able to recognize the number as official.” Mr. Cerame acknowledged that the final version of the report hedges the language to say that the additional deaths “may or may not be attributable” to the storm; the 1,427 figure was also deleted from a chart.","Hundreds of pairs of shoes in San Juan, P.R., paid tribute to the victims of Hurricane Maria.

Rayne Ellis,"Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season. Early Wednesday afternoon the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Florence, a storm brewing 2,205 miles off the coast of Bermuda, has intensified into a major storm. A hurricane is considered “major” or intense when wind speeds exceed 111 mph, which means it's at least a Category 3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century “This is almost exactly on target,"" NOAA representative Dennis Feltgen said in an interview. ""The typical day to see the first major hurricane is September 4. It’s September 5."" “Tropical Storm Gordon just hit the south, so we’ve seen seven storms already. On average, we see seven storms by September 16, so we are actually above the average,” Feltgen said. There's also a lot of uncertainty about what track Florence will take or if it will impact land at all. But there's no reason to panic, at least not yet. Models predicting the storm's path vary by 1,000 miles and meteorologists aren’t even sure if the hurricane will go north, south, turn out to the east or keep barrelling toward the west. Careful proclaiming #Florence will go west. Lots to figure out here, as short-term motion may ultimately determine long-term track. Red dot below shows where Florence crossed 45W this morning relative to 0Z EPS (from @Weathernerds ). It's way on north side of guidance for now. pic.twitter.com/7RGLMhjpjM — Levi Cowan (@TropicalTidbits) September 5, 2018 “This is certainly a storm to watch, but it’s too early to know if we’re in danger if it’s just a fish storm,” meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said in an interview. “If every model that predicted that a hurricane would hit the U.S., actually hit the U.S., the east coast would be uninhabitable.” Any prediction made this far in advance is made with uncertainty, Klotzbach explained. “If the National Hurricane Center could do 10 day forecasts with skill, they would,"" Klotzbach said. ""In 50 years, with even better models, you still won’t have certainty nine days out."" But no one should turn a blind eye to the storm. Florence has been fairly difficult to forecast already. Klotzbach said himself that earlier this week he thought Florence wouldn’t amount to more than a medium level tropical storm, but by this morning it was a major hurricane. “Hurricane Florence is certainly an overachiever. It’s been stronger than what most of the forecasters thought,” he said. “But It’s important to dial down the hype and check again in a few days.” The tropical Atlantic is now quite active. Tropical Depression Gordon is moving across Mississippi. Hurricane Florence in the central Atlantic is now a Cat 3 storm with 125 mph max winds. A tropical wave behind Florence could become a tropical depression by the end of the week. pic.twitter.com/QivVGnCjQ9 — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 5, 2018 This weekend, tracking models will be substantially more accurate as the number of factors determining the path of the storm will be made clear. Both Feltgen and Klotzbach said Hurricane Florence is an important reminder that we're approaching the peak of the hurricane season, and it's time to start planning. “Be ready, but don’t get too amped up over a nine-day forecast,” Klotzbach said.","Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season.

MEKELA PANDITHARATNE,"The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and water poured into the city, the federal government tarried. Later, Hurricane Katrina’s long pall — the more than 1,800 related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal response — would come to haunt Mr. Bush’s presidency, cratering his approval rating. President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis after last year’s storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has largely escaped the presidency-defining censure that dogged Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week,Puerto Rico’s government increased the island’s official death toll, estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane and its effects — up from the tally of just 64 that had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States in a century. So why the pass for President Trump? Mr. Trump’s scandal-plagued presidency has benefited from a deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not the White House’s job to coordinate with federal agencies and that by extension, he does not own his agencies’ failures.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","With Hurricane Florence bearing down on the East Coast, Donald Trump thought it was a good job to tweet about Hurricane Maria’s impact on Puerto Rico. Rather than warning people of the risks posed by hurricanes, he decided to make it about him and deny that nearly 3,000 Americans died on his watch because of a poor federal response. In back-to-back tweets, Trump said the 3,000 excess deaths in the storm and its aftermath—a number from a report written by top public health researchers and commissioned by the Puerto Rico government—was actually fabricated by Democrats to make him look bad. So yes, Donald Trump is not just a climate denier, he’s a hurricane death denier. “Bad politics,” he tweeted. “I love Puerto Rico!” Bad politics isn’t working diligently to estimate how many lives were lost in a storm. It’s calling the response to Maria an “unsung success” when it was clearly anything but. And loving Puerto Rico would mean not going there for a photo op, shooting hoops with paper towels, and then flying away as the federal response continues to flounder. Look, the bar is incredibly low for Donald Trump. He says wildly outlandish things and frequently lies. But this is a new bottoming out, disgracing thousands of Americans who died on his watch and their families who are still picking up the pieces. Hurricane Maria is an American tragedy that we’re still seeing unfold almost a year after the storm. And the timing is even more disturbing given what the Carolinas face. Hurricane Florence could drop a record-setting amount of rain, batter the coasts with storm surge, and unleash a torrent of toxic waste.","With Hurricane Florence bearing down on the East Coast, Donald Trump thought it was a good job to tweet about Hurricane Maria’s impact on Puerto Rico.

"Mayra Cuevas, CNN","(CNN) A year ago, Hurricane Maria tore into Puerto Rico, obliterating power grids, decimating farms, flattening homes and wrecking the local economy. Maria came on the heels of Hurricane Irma -- sister-storms that would forever change the fate of the island. But even as Maria churned, another sister-storm raged on. This one involved a sisterhood of Puerto Ricans, some living on the island, others part of the diaspora in the US mainland. Most of these women have never met, but together they display a raw human resolve capable of reinventing the island's future. Right now they are rebuilding Puerto Rican homes, restoring farms, installing solar power grids and seeking to transform the local economy -- all motivated by a heartfelt wish for the island they call home to become whole again. THE HOUSE THAT WOMEN BUILT Carla Gautier is an architect with a monumental function -- in the form of a shipping container. Days after Hurricane María flattened thousands of homes in Puerto Rico, Gautier joined FEMA as a construction inspector. ""In most houses, the only thing standing was the toilet,"" Gautier told CNN. Makeshift homes and bureaucracy collide For generations, more than half of Puerto Ricans relied on informal construction to build affordable homes and bypass a costly, bureaucratic process. It was these homes that bore the brunt of María. About 300,000 dwellings suffered significant damage and some 70,000 of those were completely destroyed, according to the island's Housing Department. Without formal property deeds, home owners struggled to get federal aid. Money was tight. ""It was really frustrating,"" Gautier said. ""I wanted to figure out a way to make a type of home construction that was accessible to everyone."" The answer: shipping containers. A container built for hurricanes ""They are fabricated to withstand the worst atmospheric conditions, in the middle of the ocean, getting hit by waves and typhoons,"" said Gautier, who had seen firsthand this type of construction used successfully in Europe. So she turned to lifelong friend Maria Gabriela Velasco, a psychologist and entrepreneur. Together they formed HiveCube to revolutionize the way Puerto Ricans build affordable homes. ""The median income on the Island is around $20,000, but the medium home value is about $100,000,"" said Velasco. ""It's not enough. That's where we come in."" HiveCube's basic model is priced at $39,000. It includes two bedrooms, one bathroom and a kitchen-living area. They are compliant with US building codes and are ADA accessible. The entire structure, including the windows, can withstand a Category 5 hurricane with winds up to 175 miles per hour, assuming it is properly anchored to a foundation. For an additional cost, the homes can be fitted with a solar power microgrid, rainwater collection and a sewage treatment system that doubles as a garden. ""The 'plano modelo,' or basic model, can be placed anywhere on the island and is considered safe housing that meets all construction codes,"" says Velasco. HiveCube is now taking orders from homeowners who can afford the units without financing and is in the process of securing an owner-financing plan with local banks. Next in line is an assembly plant. ""We are trying to establish a manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico to create jobs,"" said Velasco. ""Our goal is to build about 100 'hives' a month through a prefabrication process."" Out of María's rubble, Gautier and Velasco have created a bold new vision for affordable housing on the island. But even as they rack up awards and accolades, some only see two girls playing construction. ""Sometimes when I'm in the field buying materials I have to find ways to get the men to understand I'm the one who is making the decisions,"" Gautier told CNN. ""They want me to call the architects or the engineer or my boss. And I have to be like, 'No, I'm the boss.'"" Despite the chauvinism they've experienced, the women remain undaunted. ""We want to build a stronger and better Puerto Rico,"" said Velasco. ""Having a financially accessible home and knowing that your family is safe gives you peace of mind."" Puerto Rican farmer and activist Tara Rodriguez Besosa was stuck in New York City when María hit the island. For weeks she received no word about her family, friends or her restaurant, El Departamento de la Comida (The Food Department), a spot where local produce was the main dish.""Our restaurant got flooded and we lost everything,"" she later found out. In Colorado, Rodriquez Besosa's friend Irene Vilar was equally desperate and farther from home. ""During that time, we were thinking, what can we do?"" Vilar told CNN. For inspiration, she turned to the wisdom of her grandmother, legendary Puerto Rican nationalist Lolita Lebrón. ""I had these flashbacks to my grandmother,"" Vilar said, ""telling me 'If Puerto Ricans can feed themselves, if we can achieve food sovereignty, maybe one day we can have our 'patria,' our own country.' She was old-school."" So Vilar put out a call for seeds through her nonprofit, Americas for Conservation and the Arts. ""It was overwhelming, we had so many seeds we didn't know what to do with them."" Vilar, working with Rodriguez Besosa, launched the Resilience Fund, a two-year campaign to restore 200 farms destroyed by María. ""The idea was to prevent a second collapse of the food system,"" explained Vilar. Using a network of nonprofits and Puerto Ricans in the diaspora, the women bought a used school bus, which they named the Guagua Solidaria (the ""solidarity bus"" in English). Rodriquez Besosa drove volunteer brigades from farm to farm around the island. ""We had to intervene quickly,"" said Vilar, ""a rapid response with those farmers that were part of Tara's network. (We had to) work with the seeds that had sprouted, and prevent the farmers from closing their doors and leaving for Florida."" A year later, the Resilience Fund has helped 60 farms. They hope to help 140 more in the year ahead. Vilar and Rodriguez Besosa are on the front lines of a fast-growing movement to use locally-grown food as a way to decolonize the island. Their mission has evolved from emergency response to creating a lasting food legacy for future generations. With prime agricultural land and a tropical climate that allows food to grow year-round, Puerto Rico is a farmer's paradise. But due to decades of dependency on cheap imports, more than 80% of Puerto Rico's food is imported -- with some items like cereals, fats and sugars up to 100% imported -- according to a study by the island's CPA College. As part of their food revolution, Rodriguez Besosa, an architect by training, envisions a fundamental shift in the way farms are run -- from large, one-crop, corporate strongholds to small-scale, sustainable, locally owned farms. This way of life, she says, is nothing new. Call it the legacy of the ""Jíbaro,"" the name given to Puerto Ricans of the ""campo"" -- mostly men -- who tended their own farms and had a profound knowledge of the land. In modern times, though, it's the women leading the way. ""Half of the farmers I'm working with are women. And half of the activists in this movement are women,"" Rodriguez Besosa said. This year, Rodriguez Besosa purchased her own farm, which will be the new home of the rebranded El Departamento de la Comida. ""We are going to focus full time on workshops, advocacy and getting resources to other farmers,"" she said. Additionally, they will launch a product line of sustainable foods and nonperishable products such as jams and sauces. ""A lot of healing is involved,"" she said looking back at her work in the last year. ""We are leaving a legacy of the beautiful food system that can be Puerto Rico."" RE-STITCHING PUERTO RICO'S FASHION INDUSTRY With over 80 manufacturing plants and 10,000 skilled workers, Puerto Rico is a garment powerhouse. ""Puerto Rico has a long history of sewing craftsmanship, since the early 1900s. There has always been a substantial population of women who sew, and the manufacturing sector on the island feeds off it,"" said Auralís Herrero Lugo. She founded Retazo (""remnant"" in English), a startup launched in the wake of María to transform the island's apparel industry. Puerto Rico is a major source of military apparel in the United States, according to a Congressional Report. The industry has grown steadily over the last ten years, after legislation required all military clothing be manufactured in the United States. In Puerto Rico, this has proven both a blessing and a curse: It brought much needed cash flow, but also created a dependency on military contracts. ""After Maria, if you're not a diverse manufacturing operation, how do you survive?"" Herrero Lugo recently asked factory operators across the island -- some concerned about government contracts moving elsewhere after the hurricane. A Parsons School of Design graduate, Herrero Lugo honed her manufacturing chops in Manhattan's Garment District, where she worked as an apparel developer and designer for more than a decade. In meetings with over two dozen factories in Puerto Rico, Herrero Lugo pitched an idea that could overhaul the local industry and awaken a dormant potential: high-end, ready-to-wear fashion. ""It's a high margin niche, but it's a small quantity niche,"" explained Herrero Lugo. ""You have to learn how to do different things well. Instead of a lot of things fast."" It's a break from the current production model, in which workers receive bundles of unfinished garments and perform a single operation, then pass the work down the line where the process repeats. ""Each person is doing the same thing for ten years,"" explained Herrero Lugo. ""If the factory closes, that's the only thing they know how to do."" Instead, she's proposing a more flexible system -- known as modular production -- in which a group of workers can produce a whole garment. The groups, called modules, work together to meet production demands, and can handle smaller, more specialized orders. ""In New York, you can make 500 shirts a week in a ten-person factory. It's very efficient,"" said Herrero Lugo. To reach this level of efficiency, Retazo has created the Moda Lab, a bridge between apparel factories, garment workers, designers and small sewing co-ops comprised mostly of women working from home. In this centralized hub, designers learn how to work directly with factories and vice versa, and outside fashion companies find help navigate the resources on the island. ""We already know there is demand, more than we can keep up with,"" said Herrero Lugo. ""The next challenge is how to centralize all of this."" In the first three months of operation, Retazo Moda Lab has received ten orders for high-end ready-to-wear fashion, which they're in the process of delivering. They have an additional 30 clients on a waiting list. ""We want to plant the seeds for a fashion ecosystem to exist on the island,"" said Herrero Lugo. ""This is about coming together and seeing the potential of being good at multiple things."" PUERTO RICO'S POWER WOMEN In its wake, Hurricane Maria created the largest blackout in US history -- and the second-largest in world history -- leaving over 1.5 million Puerto Ricans in the dark. ""Everyone who was stateside was freaking out,"" Resilient Power Puerto Rico co-founder Cristina Roig-Morris told CNN. Roig-Morris, born and raised on the island, is a member of New York's Puerto Rican diaspora. ""All of us with family and friends and close ties to the island, we were trying to come up with a way to help,"" the corporate attorney recalled. After a month, it became clear that there were already these amazing service organizations on the island that had the systems, infrastructure and personnel to help people. But they didn't have power."" Roig-Morris reached out to community activists involved in the reconstruction of the Rockaways, a stretch of New York devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Within a week, they formed their nonprofit. ""We got materials, solar panels, then flew them down there, got crews on the ground,"" said Roig-Morris. Resilient Power's mission quickly evolved from crisis response to building partnerships with community organizations providing critical services to vulnerable groups like the elderly, children and the impoverished. The first project was completed in Caño Martín Peña, a humble community of about 26,000 within the boundaries of San Juan. Resilient Power installed solar power microgrids in four community centers. ""We see this project as emblematic of our mission,"" said Roig-Morris. ""We are not coming in and throwing solar panels on roofs. We want to work with communities to empower them, adapt these systems, own these systems and become aware of the long-term resilience."" Amplifying the investment On the ground, Resilient Power's director of programs, Alejandra Castrodad-Rodriguez, is finding ways to multiply the impact of every dollar invested in solar energy. Castrodad-Rodriguez joined Resilient as part of a collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute, a renewable energy-focused non-profit. ""You make the investment be so much more because of where you are placing those solar panels,"" Castrodad-Rodriguez said. ""You are choosing a community asset who is providing other services like education, clean water, health clinics."" Resilient Power has identified about 100 community centers across the island that meet those criteria. Castrodad-Rodriguez, an economist and former resilience chief for the City of San Juan, believes Maria laid bare Puerto Rico's electrical vulnerabilities. ""It's impossible to put it into words,"" she said of the 11 months the island spent in darkness. ""It's a call for a complete revolution in how we think about energy, from centralized systems to decentralized systems."" More local control of -- and access to -- the power infrastructure is the name of the game. This energy revolution is driving collaboration between women, and between Puerto Ricans living on the island and the diaspora on the mainland. Empowering people with electricity ""Everyone should have the option to be independent from the grid,"" Roig-Morris said. ""That equals resilience from the inevitable challenges ahead."" Long-term, she explained, Resilient Power plans to emphasize training of young people in collaboration with universities on the island, and to promote an alternative-energy industry that creates jobs. In the meantime, Castrodad-Rodriguez sees in her role an opportunity to give underrepresented communities a voice, especially women trying to break into a male-dominated industry. ""Change is about bringing new voices into the conversation about development,"" she said. ""The female perspective and the community perspective are about participation, inclusion and collaboration. We are uniquely positioned to transform the way we work together toward a more equitable, sustainable future for the country.""","A year ago, Hurricane Maria tore into Puerto Rico, obliterating its infrastructure and wrecking the local economy.

Shannon Connellan,"Lin-Manuel Miranda may just be one of the nicest guys in show business. The Hamilton creator not only bringing a production of his award-winning Broadway show to Puerto Rico, still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, but he has bigger plans. SEE ALSO: Lin-Manuel Miranda is coming to bless your bookshelf According to the Associated Press, Miranda isn't just going to bring the show to Puerto Rico in January. He's setting up multimillion-dollar fund to boost the arts in the U.S. territory, made up of all proceeds from the limited three-week run. Dubbed the Flamboyan Arts Fund, it's intended to support the island's arts community and to rebuild arts institutions like galleries and theaters. Miranda told reporters on Sunday he hopes to see it grow to $15 million with the help of private and public funding. “The goal wasn’t just artistic satisfaction, but how can we leave Puerto Rico a little better than we found it,” he told AP. Miranda, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico, will return to the title role of Hamilton in January, when the show is performed at the University of Puerto Rico's campus in San Juan. The damage caused by Hurricane Maria is estimated at more than $100 billion. All over Puerto Rico, art galleries, museums and other institutions are still managing the post-Maria deluge. According to a report by The New York Times, the institutions don't expect much government help to rebuild and develop, as Puerto Rico is currently in the midst of a recession — $74 billion in debt. But with a leg-up like Miranda's Flamboyan Arts Fund, which has reportedly already awarded funds to a dance school and a theater company, the island's arts industry could finally rebuild.","Lin-Manuel Miranda may just be one of the nicest guys in show business.

Megan Geuss,"Enlarge / Solar panels visible over the roof of a community kitchen in Humacao, PR. reader comments 0 German battery company Sonnen and its Puerto Rican solar-installing partner, Pura Energía, announced that they've installed six solar-plus-storage systems around Puerto Rico, and have plans for nine more. The initial six systems were donated, according to a press release from Sonnen, though it's unclear whether the subsequent nine will be donated or funded by some other entity. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island more than ten weeks ago, Sonnen and its stationary-storage rival Tesla both promised to donate resources to help set up renewable energy systems and microgrids. (Tesla completed a solar-plus-storage installation at a children's hospital in late October, though it didn't release details about the size of the installation or its price.) Since the hurricane, scandal after scandal have complicated the restoration of the island's main grid, leaving residents relying on diesel or gas generators for power and making cheap, emission-free solar power all the more vital. The systems installed by Sonnen and Pura Energía each include an array of solar panels, as well as stationary batteries from Sonnen's Atlanta, Georgia manufacturing center, which store solar energy for evening use. Three of the panel-and-battery pairings have been installed at lavendarías (laundromats) in La Perla, Loizia, and Morovis. The La Perla and Morovis installations both have 8kW, 16kWh batteries, and the one at Loiza received a 4kW, 8kWh battery. The microgrids are ""used to power community washing machines, refrigerators, and some basic electrical outlets,"" Sonnen said. Enlarge / Humacao community site leader Christine Nievas Rodriguez and a Sonnen battery. Another system with a 8kW, 16kWh battery was installed at a food shelter in Humacao, powering ""refrigeration and meal preparation for up to 500 individuals per day."" In Aguadilla, a system with a 4kW, 8kWh battery ""provides lights, refrigeration, microwaves, and fans for a school that provides psychological services for children with behavioral and developmental disabilities."" Finally, another system in Maricao received two 4kW, 8kWh batteries to power ""refrigerators, lights, cellular router, and other power services for a shelter housing 45 residents displaced by the hurricane in an isolated mountain town that will likely be without power for many months."" Although these community solar and battery installations are small, microgrid advocates argue that they're a step in the right direction. Local energy production and storage fosters energy resilience, which will become more important as climate change makes grid-stressing heat and weather events more common. Distributed energy systems offer assurance that if a storm takes out a major generation plant, residents of smaller communities don't need to wait for expensive, long-distance transmission lines to be rebuilt before normal services resume. These concerns aren't recent, or specific to Puerto Rico, either. After Superstorm Sandy hit the east coast in 2012, New York state funded microgrid research in the hopes of avoiding the power outages the region experienced in the the storm's aftermath. In Puerto Rico, many residents are now entering their third month without power from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). As of December 3, the government says only has 68 percent of PREPA's generating units are back online (and generating units do not reflect the proportion of customers with their power restored). The troubles are partially due to the fact that many of the island's transmission lines were located on difficult-to-reach, mountainous terrain, but politics has had its share of influence in the delays as well. Soon after the hurricane struck, PREPA made a $300 million deal with a Montana company called Whitefish Energy to rebuild the island's destroyed grid. But news began to surface that called into question the terms of the deal, which appeared to offer higher rates and per diem allowances for Whitefish's contractors than seemed normal. A leak of the contract between PREPA and Whitefish also showed that the contract prevented the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and FEMA from performing an audit of Whitefish's costs and profit. In addition, the contract seemed to indicate that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) signed off on the deal, though FEMA denied having seen the contract at all. In October, Puerto Rico's governor said he wanted to end the deal with Whitefish, though the contractor has remained on the island to finish up the work that it began.","Now more than ten weeks out from Hurricane Maria, many Puerto Ricans still using generators.",2017-12-03T20:30:39Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Sonnen, Pura Energía build solar systems in Puerto Rico as utility woes continue",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/__trashed-2/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Photo-2-Humacao_kitchen-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Hurricane Maria,1
Max Knoblauch,"It's been two months since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the island without power and causing the longest blackout in United States history. Thousands of protesters marched throughout Washington D.C. on Sunday in the ""Unity March for Puerto Rico,"" a show of support for ongoing disaster relief efforts after the U.S. territory was decimated by Maria, a Category 4 storm. SEE ALSO: Trump says Puerto Rico hurricane response was a '10' but these numbers prove otherwise The march, attended by numerous politicians, as well as celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and chef José Andres, led protesters from the Capitol Building to the Lincoln Memorial. As of Nov. 19, two months after the storm made landfall, 50 percent of the island is still without power. Power lines that have been restored remain unstable, causing daily, widespread outages. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that 75 percent of the island will have power by the end of January. According to their website, Unity March organizers are calling for more aid in rebuilding Puerto Rico, the permanent repeal of the Jones Act (which slows down recovery efforts), and the cancellation of Puerto Rico's more than $70 billion in debt. President Donald Trump has previously criticized Puerto Rico's debt, suggesting that it could limit the aid it receives. In fact, that criticism is one of the factors that prompted Sunday's march.

RICK ROJAS,"“The minute we got into the law school, we knew there was a very minimal amount of jobs we could acquire as lawyers working in a firm there already,” said Lourdes Carreras-Ortiz, a University of Puerto Rico law student. But before the storm, Ms. Alers-Ortiz said, many Puerto Ricans were able to maintain at least the facade of a middle-class life: They had cellphones, went to the movies, shopped for clothes at Plaza Las Américas, a sprawling mall in San Juan. The storm washed that away. “Our first-world mask has been ripped off,” she said. “Now, we’re third world.” “The feeling is life stopped,” she added. Members of the diaspora, even recent arrivals, argue that they can contribute to Puerto Rico’s recovery from afar. They point to a surge of money and supplies, and they said they can push elected officials to direct more aid to the island. A report published by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College projected that upward of 200,000 people could leave the island in the year after the hurricane, and that by 2019, that figure could approach a half-million people, or about 14 percent of the island’s population. Researchers anticipate the demographic shifts created by migration will spread beyond Florida and the New York metropolitan area, places that already have longstanding ties to the island, to communities across the country. Aja Nelson had been displaced twice: She fled St. Thomas, one of the United States Virgin Islands, for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, only to be pushed out again by Maria. Now, Ms. Nelson is staying with relatives in Atlanta. “I am just shell shocked,” she said. Jose Manuel Ureña, 24, had been a cook for the last two years at a restaurant in Condado, an upscale area of San Juan that had been popular with tourists, and also helped his brother take care of their mother. He said he had lost his job and a friend promised to help him find work in a kitchen in Newark, where he was heading. “My plan is to get to New Jersey and work until I can’t anymore,” he said. “I can’t wait to have a home again.” Many who left Puerto Rico described an existence that had been stripped down to its basics, their days spent collecting food, water and fuel. When Mr. Franceschini arrived in New York, he began to notice the trivial things he had once taken for granted, like when he had a cool drink. “You’re really excited over ice,” he said. Touro Law Center is one of many schools across the country that have welcomed displaced students. A small group had come just for the semester and expected to return to their school next year, but now they realize their time away is likely not enough to restore living conditions to what they were before the storm. “The Puerto Rican way of life is gone as we know it,” Mr. Camacho-Vazquez said. “This is a fact.” The grim situation on the island has forced the students, who are mostly in their third year of law school, to reassess their plans after they graduate and whatever obligation they have to Puerto Rico. “I don’t owe the government anything, but I do owe my island something,” Ms. Carreras-Ortiz said as she sat with her classmates on campus one recent afternoon. “I lived there. I grew up there. The place — not only physically the island but the people, the life there — it gave me so much, and I’m the person I am because I lived on the island.” “I do want to go back for Puerto Rico,” she added. “If everybody who can do something just leaves, the island is gone. There’s no progress.” “That’s the thing,” another student, Cesar Rivera, interjected. “That is very admirable, but those who leave, I cannot blame.” Sandra E.

Mark Kaufman,"The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1. Currently spinning off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, forecasters named the subtropical storm ""Alberto,"" which is the first of 21 names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has on its list of possible storm names for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. On Friday, Alberto met the minimum requirements for earning a name, having reached sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states both this weekend and into early next week, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA. A storm needs to hit sustained wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour to be considered a Category 1 storm, the least intense hurricane classification. Yesterday, the National Hurricane Center released its 2018 hurricane forecast, and they expect 2018 to be an ""active season,"" with between 10 to 16 named storms, five to nine of which being hurricanes. ""This is a fair amount of activity we’re expecting."" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. Tropical Storm conditions associated with #Alberto are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through Saturday. Tropical Storm conditions could reach the northern Gulf Coast as early as Sunday morning. pic.twitter.com/MImTcKhB2z — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) May 25, 2018 Last hurricane season — which produced the immensely destructive hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — was exceptionally active, said Bell, who doesn't currently expect this season to produce such intense activity. Hurricane forecasters analyze a combination of short and long-term climate trends, along with sophisticated computer models when making their predictions for a hurricane season. Since 1995, the Atlantic and Caribbean have seen ""very active"" seasons, said Bell, as a decades-long climate trend in the Atlantic Ocean has kept water temperatures warmer, contributing to a higher number of storms. In addition to this effect, NASA says that modern storm research shows hurricanes are getting stronger, lasting longer, and dumping significantly more rain. Rising sea levels, an indisputable result of human-induced climate change, exacerbates the effect of already damaging storms by producing higher surges of water. As for Alberto, the National Hurricane Service recommends that Gulf Coast residents watch for the agency's regular updates, found easily on either their homepage or Twitter account.","The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“The limitation we had with Maria is we had no cash to burn,” said the governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló. Emergency managers and business leaders also are concerned about the logistics of getting aid into Puerto Rico. Maria created a bottleneck at the Port of San Juan, which slowed everything from food to electrical poles. “What am I most worried about?” Mr. Byrne said. “A ship sinks in the channel in San Juan, and we can’t bring anything.” Manuel Reyes Alfonso, executive vice president of MIDA, the island’s food industry association, said wholesale and retail businesses continued to experience delays in receiving cargo. “We are not where we’d like to be, or where we should be,” he said. He worries about a trucker shortage and about slow fuel delivery for generators. Puerto Rico had fuel after Maria, but no easy way to get it to people, leading to endless lines at gas stations and a black market for diesel sales. FEMA had to bring in a fuel barge for its operations. Food could also be scarce again, Mr. Reyes said, because Puerto Rico continues to impose a tax on inventories. Eliminating the tax could increase food stores to an average of 37 days from 26, according to a survey that the food association conducted of its members in February. A legislative effort to do away with the tax has stalled, Mr. Reyes said, in part because lawmakers have yet to figure out how to make up for the lost revenue. Photo Puerto Rico officials worry that the island remains vulnerable to another storm because repairs to the power grid have been slow in some areas, including Las Piedras. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Rodrigo Masses, president of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, said he had advised businesses to double their fuel storage capacity, keep their generators in shape and designate an emergency contact off the island to relay information in the event cellphone service fails again. “We’re still not out of the crisis. If we’re hit by another hurricane like this one, we’re going to lose power again. We’re going to lose connectivity again,” he warned. “But the private sector is going to be much better prepared.” Once the Corps of Engineers departs, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, will be tasked with completing unfinished repairs to the power grid. At a hearing last week of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in Washington, lawmakers sounded skeptical that Prepa, which has come under fierce scrutiny over its early response to the storm, is up to the job. Representative González-Colón has asked FEMA to extend the Corps’ stay. “We sure want to know that you really are ready,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Prepa’s new chief, Walter Higgins, at the hearing. “We feel that we are ready,” Mr. Higgins said. But, he added, “I don’t doubt that we will have some growing pains.” In Las Piedras, which sits on the hills south of El Yunque National Forest, people who have electricity say it goes out often. “If a little bit of wind blows through, we will lose power,” said Roberto Rosado, 53, who still has metal shutters on his sliding doors. “We just lost power now. This is an everyday occurrence.” Mayor Miguel López, who is known as Micky, recently blocked two of the three power crews from leaving his town. “There was no other option,” said Mr. López, whose unorthodox strategy succeeded in keeping the linemen at work. His director of emergency management, Xavier Muñoz, said the one upside of Maria was that it had scared residents into taking hurricane plans seriously. “Shelters are going to get full,” he predicted. “I have 220 cots right now, and I think that’s not going to be enough.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Kissimmee, Florida (CNN) With no running water, no power and no school for her kids, Carmen ""Millie"" Santiago fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last fall. Like thousands of evacuees, she landed here in central Florida. And, like hundreds, she's still stuck in a motel. Seven months after the storm, the quick-witted 50-year-old with chestnut hair and a warm smile has become the de facto mayor of ""El Super Ocho,"" or Super 8, the beige motel in the shadow of Disney World where she lives with her husband and two children. She keeps business cards of apartment managers, case workers and potential employers spread out on a table by the motel room door -- anything that might help her neighbors figure out how to survive the complex and increasingly eternal limbo they find themselves in. This week, hundreds of evacuees were told they would be booted from the motels where they've lived rent-free on assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. On Friday at 1 p.m., after mounting pressure from members of Congress, Puerto Rico's governor and evacuees like Millie, as well as multiple inquiries from CNN, FEMA announced it would extend the motel assistance for Maria survivors until May 14. Millie and others didn't know where they would have gone without the extension. And after what one advocate described as a week of panic, they still don't know what will happen next month. She does know what happens to evacuees who lose the motel vouchers, though: There's the mother of two who says she slept several nights in a car after FEMA's motel-room assistance ran out in March. There's the family of eight -- four children, their parents and grandparents -- who slept together in a motel room with only two beds. In that room on a recent day, a 7-year-old girl ate spaghetti for lunch using the end of a plastic coat hanger as a utensil. Some families say they've relocated four, five and six times to avoid sleeping on the streets. Meanwhile, shelters near Kissimmee, the southern suburb of Orlando that's come to be known as ""Puerto Rico north,"" are full. Low-income housing is unavailable. Rents are out of reach. Non-profits have been sapped of resources. And federal aid for the evacuees either is running out or was never offered. At issue are two FEMA housing programs. One, called the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, pays motel bills for people whose homes were damaged in Puerto Rico, even if the disaster victims left the island. That program, according to FEMA documents, was designed to be used for about two weeks. It has been extended repeatedly. More than 1,200 cases in the 50 states had been determined by FEMA to be ineligible for continued assistance after this week, according to documents provided to CNN, with about half of those cases in Florida. In a letter to FEMA on Wednesday, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, requested an ""unconditional extension"" of the motel program. ""It is vital that FEMA approve this request immediately so that countless Puerto Rican families, who have lost everything as a result of this catastrophic disaster, are not once again uprooted in a chaotic fashion,"" he wrote. ""If FEMA does not approve the (Puerto Rico) government's request, students currently finishing the school year in the mainland will be deprived of their education, as well as their housing."" It's not clear whether FEMA will decide to extend the program beyond May 14. The federal agency contests the assertion that it would put people out on the street by ending their assistance. The Transition Shelter Assistance program is meant to provide emergency housing in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. It is ""tragic"" so many families have had to continue to live in motels for months without other viable housing options, said Mike Byrne, FEMA's federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, in an interview with CNN last week. ""There comes a point when these problems are no longer really disaster problems but are social problems,"" Byrne said. ""The idea that we're throwing people on the street -- there's no accuracy, there's no truth to that type of thing. ""We are doing everything we can to help these people,"" Byrne said, ""but if their home is fixed, or they have the ability to stay with family or friends... and they choose that they don't want to go back (to Puerto Rico), then, quite frankly, they fall out of this program"" offering motel rental assistance. ""They've made a decision not to use the assistance that we've provided,"" he said. ""That's their decision. And this is a free country."" Applicants can lose the FEMA motel vouchers if their homes in Puerto Rico are found to be livable, after inspection; or if FEMA finds they have other viable housing options, such as friends they could live with, among other requirements, said Byrne. Those restrictions were at least temporarily lifted to allow disaster victims to keep getting assistance until next month. Evacuees should contact FEMA if they believe their case was handled unfairly, Byrne said, and individual aid may be extended beyond May 14 if warranted. Transitional Shelter Assistance isn't the only FEMA program stirring controversy, however. Another FEMA program, called Direct Lease, could pay for longer-term rentals, which advocates say would be more humane and prevent homelessness among evacuees. That FEMA housing program, however, has not been made available to Hurricane Maria evacuees living in Florida or other US states. FEMA is offering that assistance only to evacuees who return to Puerto Rico, or to people who never left the island. FEMA will go so far as to pay for a person's flight back to the Caribbean island, Byrne said. No one has taken the agency up on that offer yet, he said. Asked why the Direct Lease program is not offered in Florida, Byrne at first said that he believed Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló had not requested it. CNN, however, obtained a January 31 letter to FEMA from a member of the Rosselló administration requesting Direct Lease assistance for ""eligible evacuees from Puerto Rico not only here on the island, but also for those located across the United States."" In response, Byrne said it would not be prudent to provide long-term lease payments for people living in Florida rather than in the territory directly hit by the disaster. In his lengthy career, which has included working on the response to Superstorm Sandy and other emergencies, FEMA had never provided long-term housing in that way, he said. ""The reason they are eligible (for FEMA assistance) is because they had a home in Puerto Rico. And so we're going to provide the option of a home in Puerto Rico,"" he said. In the void, at least in part, there's Millie. She receives many of the evacuees' tearful phone calls. They knock on her motel door late at night. She tries to counsel her neighbors and new friends as they are evicted and struggle to find affordable housing -- a process some evacuees described as so stressful it had induced panic attacks. And she coordinates with community advocates and aid organizations. In short: She's trying to help others before herself. ""The captain is always the last to leave the ship,"" she said. Researchers fear an 'exodus' from Puerto Rico Central Florida long has been a destination for Puerto Ricans. The island is a US commonwealth home to 3.3 million American citizens, and residents can move freely to the 50 states without visas or other documentation. New York once was seen as the mecca for Puerto Rico outmigration. It's been eclipsed more recently by Florida, in part because of the warm climate that's more similar to Puerto Rico and also because of what community advocates call the ""Disney Dream"" -- a fairy-tale vision of Orlando and its theme parks. Puerto Rico was suffering a massive and unprecedented population loss before Hurricane Maria hit, largely because of a debt crisis that bankrupted the island's government and crippled the economy. After Maria, some demographers told CNN they feared an ""exodus"" lasting many years, with repercussions for Puerto Rico and for host communities on the mainland. As CNN reported in February, Florida -- particularly the Orlando-Kissimmee area -- appears to be the top destination for Maria evacuees. That assessment is based on a review of FEMA disaster assistance data and US Postal Service change-of-address requests from Puerto Rico. While it's impossible to say exactly how many people fled the island after the storm, estimates range from thousands to more than 100,000. In Florida alone, the state's department of education told CNN this week that nearly 12,000 new students from Puerto Rico have enrolled in public schools in the months since Hurricane Maria. The two top school districts for enrollees in Florida were Orange County, which includes Orlando, and Osceola County, which is home to Kissimmee. Evacuees are arriving to find that Orlando and Kissimmee offer anything but the ""Disney Dream"" they imagined -- or that they saw on vacations and heard about from relatives. Like many cities in the United States, Orlando and Kissimmee suffer from a crippling affordable-housing shortage, making it difficult if not impossible for evacuees to find stable housing outside of motels. A March report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition named Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford the third-worst large metro area in the nation in terms of affordable housing availability. For every 100 renters needing low-income housing, the report said, only 17 units are available. Government housing programs are not meeting needs, either. The Orlando Housing Authority told CNN it had 18 units -- total -- available when the storm hit. Neither that housing authority nor Osceola County, which includes Kissimmee, had any new and available Section 8 vouchers that could be used by evacuees. Those vouchers let recipients search for subsidized housing. Only evacuees who brought Section 8 vouchers from Puerto Rico could qualify to transfer those vouchers, according to Vivian Bryant, president and CEO of the Orlando Housing Authority. ""We haven't received a new allocation of Section 8 vouchers,"" Bryant said. ""We are 101% leased up. We don't even have anything we can offer anybody."" Non-profits and churches are strained, too. There are currently no open shelter beds for homeless people in the Orlando metro area, said Martha Are, executive director of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. Additionally, the one shelter that serves homeless people in Osceola County, where many evacuees live along US Highway 192, takes only domestic-violence victims, she said. So if evacuees came to a shelter after getting kicked off the FEMA motel program, would they be turned away? CNN asked. ""That's right,"" she said. With federal help lacking, the financial burden of helping Maria evacuees in Florida is falling -- and falling hard -- on churches and non-profits, said Rev. Jose Rodriguez, from Iglesia Episcopal Jesús de Nazaret in Orlando. His congregation had been helping pay the rent of some Puerto Rico evacuees who lost or were not granted FEMA motel assistance, he said. But in mid-April the church had run out of grant money and donations, he said, and would have to stop assisting evacuees at least temporarily. In his view, FEMA is leaning too much on goodwill. ""They're homeless. They're couch surfing,"" he said of evacuees. Programs that should be helping them transition to a stable life in Florida are ""failing them,"" he said. Sociologists have documented what they call ""disaster fatigue"" that sets in months after an event like Hurricane Maria. People who may have been inclined to donate to Puerto Rico immediately after the September storm may not realize, or care, that needs continue so many months later, both on and off the island. Advocates in Florida worry that this fatigue may be without remedy. Meanwhile, the influx of Puerto Rican evacuees is expected to continue. Thousands of homes on the island have not had power in seven months. Just this week, the entire island was temporarily without electricity in a major blackout. Eight people, two beds, one motel room At dawn, the kids walk out of motels to bus stops on a highway. Some are the children of Maria. Their homes were damaged or destroyed when the September hurricane smashed into Puerto Rico; they were left without power or running water, often both, for months; their parents were left jobless, or without clear job prospects on the island; and many of their schools were closed. In short: They fled for a safer, better life. Florida said they were welcome. ""As Puerto Rico rebuilds, Florida remains committed to doing everything we can to help the families impacted by Hurricane Maria and aid in the recovery process,"" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement issued October 2, the same day Florida declared a state of emergency in reference to the arrival of Puerto Rican migrants. Millie, the ""mayor"" of the Super 8 in Kissimmee, said she heard via social media that Florida planned to welcome evacuees and help them enroll in schools. She ran a day care -- named ""El Palacio de los Niños,"" or The Children's Palace -- in Carolina, a town not far from San Juan. She needed to find a personal generator to keep it operational. She came to Florida, she said, to enroll her kids in school and to sort out how to reopen her business. Later, however, inspectors closed the daycare because of her absence and because the facility lacked power and running water, she said. That's when she decided to stay here. Perhaps it's her experience with that daycare -- the parents of her students still send her photos from Puerto Rico; she misses the kids dearly -- that prepared her for the role of caring for evacuees. With so many people in need, she felt like she had to help. She does so joyfully, laughing as often as she cries. Asked if there were some evacuees she hadn't been able to help adequately, she responded: CNN interviewed more than a dozen evacuees in the Orlando and Tampa metro areas. Few expressed any desire to return to Puerto Rico. And despite the difficulties they've had adjusting to motel life, many were grateful to FEMA, charitable organizations and family members who had given them places to stay. Dacny L. Quintero Segarra talked about the situation on the walkway outside her motel room in the Baymont Inn and Suites on US Highway 192 in Kissimmee -- a stretch of road, also known as Vine Street, that's home to at least 10 motels listed by FEMA as accepting motel vouchers. She had a Walmart bag tied over her hair. Beneath it, she had applied an ointment, she said, to stop the rest of her hair from falling out. She attributes the problem to stress. ""I feel like this is Narnia,"" she said -- like everything is turned around. ""The housing situation is very, very, very bad,"" she said. ""Everything is a 'no.' They say they're going to help you but we've only helped each other -- Puerto Ricans banding together. I'm not interested in material things. All I want is shelter for my kids."" Quintero told CNN that FEMA offered her a free flight back to Puerto Rico. ""If I tell them I want to go back to Puerto Rico, they would say, 'Here's the money, buy your tickets.' But it's not just that. I want to live here,"" she said, primarily because there are jobs and schools. Downstairs, her parents, Alfredo Quintero and Dacny Segarra, who goes by the same name as her daughter, live in a room with wide doors to accommodate Alfredo's wheelchair. The elder Dacny said she had stopped taking medicine she needs to prevent blood clots because she has no health insurance in Florida and can't afford the pills without it. She said she was hospitalized in Florida because of blood clots in her legs. The older couple was told this week that they would lose FEMA assistance after April 20. That was before FEMA announced the extension into May -- an announcement that came the day before their scheduled eviction. Carlos Lara Santos, who is raising a baby girl, Valentina, born on April 2, already knew he'd get to stay until May 14, he told CNN. The family is living in the Super 8 with seven children, including the newborn. ""If you have a home, it's comfortable, the conditions are better,"" he said. ""If you have to raise a child in a hotel room, it's not the same."" Without FEMA assistance, some families end up in a cycle of motel eviction and debt. Liza Hernandez had been living in a two-bedroom unit at the Super 8 in Kissimmee with seven of her relatives. Initially, the family got help with hotel fees from FEMA, she said, but that ran out. They were able to start paying for the Super 8 on their own because three of the eight family members work. Then the hotel rate went up to $113.40 per night. The family fled to the Unno Boutique Hotel -- $50.22 per night. There, all eight were crammed into one room with two beds. They haven't been able to find an apartment, she said. At the other end of the highway, near a gift shop shaped like a massive orange -- ""Welcome to Florida: Take Some Home"" -- and another shop shaped like a wizard, Yamil Rodriguez was staying in a Holiday Inn. He said he had been putting the room on a credit card, and the hotel staff had been nice enough not to run the charge. He knew it wouldn't last, though. ""I'm waiting for a miracle,"" he said. On April 9, he sent a panicked message to a reporter. ""I'm on the street right now."" Rodriguez landed in another motel later that night. He and several other evacuees expressed gratitude toward the hotels that have housed them these past months. Many know the names of their housekeepers and greet them with hugs. Rodriguez said the Holiday Inn was kind to let the family stay as long as it did. Some Maria migrants know friends or family members in Florida and stay with them -- at least for a time. ""There's a saying in Spanish: 'After three days, the dead start to smell,"" said Julio, 53, who had been living, along with his wife and five of his six children, with a niece near Tampa. ""The house is getting small."" The landlord threatened to evict all of them on April 15, including the niece, if Julio and his family didn't move elsewhere, he said. By April 19, he'd moved to Jacksonville to live with his adult son and to look for work. The place is too small for all of them, he said, so his wife and five kids are still living with the niece in secret. ""It's like they're hiding out,"" he said. (CNN is not using Julio's last name in order to protect the family.) Julio expected to start work through a job placement service later this week. He hopes to save up enough money so they might get their own place -- eventually. ""Thank God we're alive, you know, so we can continue on this journey,"" Julio said. Still, this sort of uncertainty can be exhausting -- and potentially dangerous. Melissa, a young mother of three, said her home in Puerto Rico was so damaged that she initially slept on the floor of her mother-in-law's house on the island. That situation became untenable so she decided to come to Florida. She didn't know anyone here well enough to ask for a place to stay, she said, so she slept in the airport in Orlando. ( The Florida governor ordered welcome centers be established in major airports in the state; Melissa, whose full name CNN is withholding to protect the privacy of her children, said she did not see the welcome center in Orlando). In total, her family has lived in six locations since Hurricane Maria, she said. In March, when she lost FEMA motel assistance, she and her husband slept in their cars with their children, ages 4 and 9, for three nights. ""FEMA just told me, 'Call the Red Cross or look for a shelter,'"" she said. FEMA declined to comment on individual circumstances, citing privacy laws. Melissa posted a praying-hands emoji and a cryptic plea for help on her Facebook page. A friend responded with a temporary place to stay. She wore out her welcome before ending up back in motels. Now the family is paying $500 per month, she said, to rent a single bedroom in a house. She's not sure how long that will last, but it's better than paying weekly motel fees. ""I'm really thankful for the help we've gotten,"" said Melissa. ""They gave me jackets and blankets and supplies. The school treated us well. ""But FEMA? When there are children, you can't let people sleep on the street. It's not the same for an adult to be on the street as for kids to be."" 'This could have been done far more humanely' Disaster experts, community advocates and Democratic politicians are similarly critical. The longer children live in motels the more likely they are to be exposed to ""toxic stress"" that can contribute to long-term problems in school and mental health issues, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York. ""It is an extremely urgent matter to get these families with their children into a stable situation that is predictable and reestablish a sense of routine,"" he said. Redlener said motels don't do that. ""It's an extremely makeshift, temporary answer to a very complex problem,"" he said. ""It doesn't work for long, living in a motel, especially a crowded motel. It is a terrible situation for a young child."" People who flee disasters often think they will be able to escape trauma by relocating, he said, but that rarely proves to be the case. The hurricane follows them. The best way to help disaster survivors recover, he said, is to provide longer-term apartment housing. FEMA does offer a ""Rental Assistance"" program for hurricane victims, both in Puerto Rico and in the 50 states. The agency has allocated $121 million to that effort, but officials told CNN they were unable to say how many recipients of that assistance were living in the states versus Puerto Rico. The program provides disaster survivors with a monthly rental payment for up to 18 months, depending on eligibility. That payment, however, according to a FEMA spokesperson, is based on the rental market in the community where the person lived at the time of the disaster, not where they are currently living. That means a person who fled Puerto Rico for Florida would get paid a rental stipend based on the rental market in Puerto Rico, the spokesperson said, not that of Florida, which is far more expensive. The fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is $530 per month, according to a US Department of Housing and Urban Development index. In Osceola County, Florida, it's $1,096 -- more than double. Those amounts can be adjusted depending on family circumstances and other factors. As for the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, more than 7,000 applicants have gotten motel vouchers as part of the Hurricane Maria recovery, according to FEMA. About 2,700 applicants still were staying in motels as of mid-April, nearly seven months later, according to Byrne, the FEMA official in Puerto Rico. Nearly 40% of those current residents are in Florida. In all, FEMA has spent $64.4 million on the motel program for Maria victims. ""Just like a shelter is not intended to be a long-term solution for somebody, a hotel room... was never intended to be a long-term solution,"" said Byrne, the FEMA official. ""What we work hard at is to provide overarching case management to these families... to help them find a way back into their home (in Puerto Rico)."" He added, ""I don't think anybody wants to stay in a hotel.... It gets old fast. Imagine if you had your whole family with you in a one-room hotel. We want to try to find another solution for those people (who are still living in hotels) as quickly as possible."" Without more transitional help, however, hurricane victims ""fall off a cliff"" when they're booted from motels, said Rodriguez, the Episcopal priest in Orlando. ""Stop kicking this can down the road and just give them permanent housing,"" he said. ""There needs to be a game plan. It's a waste of taxpayer money to be dumping money into hotel stays."" The whiplash of the threatened voucher cutoffs and last-minute extensions causes unnecessary turmoil for disaster survivors, he said. ""We have three weeks for people to find homes,"" he said, referring to the May 14 FEMA cutoff. ""They lost a week in panic, now we have three weeks to find them homes. How are we going to house over 1,000 people?"" ""We still have these families who are going to have to vacate before the end of the school year,"" he added. The fact that the Direct Lease program -- which can provide housing for 18 months or sometimes longer -- is offered in Puerto Rico, but not in Florida, has been criticized by US Rep. Darren Soto, a Democrat who represents Kissimmee and central Florida. ""This could have been done far more humanely if the Trump administration would have approved long-term lease vouchers,"" Soto told CNN. ""It would have allowed these people to save up enough money for a deposit and live in a far more humane environment. ""It's not a priority for the White House to have these (longer-term housing programs) approved,"" Soto said. ""Otherwise it easily would have been done."" FEMA officials have said repeatedly that they're handling Hurricane Maria's recovery as they would any other storm of this magnitude, regardless of the fact that Puerto Rico is not a US state, does not have voting members in the US Congress -- and that its residents can't vote for president. Chris Currie, director of emergency management issues at the US Government Accountability Office, said there are no rules barring FEMA from offering longer-term Direct Lease assistance in Florida. ""I don't see anything in the guidance or statutes that restricts where they could purchase or lease units for direct housing assistance,"" Currie said. ""There is nothing that would just absolutely bar them from that. ""Whether they decide to use it -- or it makes sense -- is a whole other story."" On a recent afternoon, Millie and a friend visited evacuee motels up and down US Highway 192 in Kissimmee. They wanted to raise awareness about a job fair and rally hosted by the group Vamos4PR, which, like the Hispanic Federation, Latino Leadership, Inc., and others, has been trying to help Puerto Rican evacuees in central Florida. On one of the stops, she pulled into the Radisson parking lot and hollered out the window of her blue minivan: ""Hola! Tú eres Boricua?"" she asked. Are you Puerto Rican? Yes, a young mother, Raysha Vargas, answered. Her daughter, age 2, walked across a yellow speedbump in the hotel parking lot. The girl extended her arms to the left and right, like a gymnast teetering on a balance beam. Are you on FEMA assistance? Yes, the woman said. For now.","With no running water, no power and no school for her kids, Carmen ""Millie"" Santiago fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last fall.

Reuters Editorial,"CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo. The illegal shantytown emerged on a public wetland after 1989’s Hurricane Hugo left thousands homeless. About 6,000 squatters landed here, near the El Yunque National Forest, and built makeshift homes on 40 acres that span a low-lying valley and its adjacent mountainside. Wood and concrete dwellings, their facades scrawled with invented addresses, sit on cinder blocks. After Maria, many are missing roofs; some have collapsed altogether. Amid the rubble, 59-year-old Joe Quirindongo sat in the sun one recent day on a wooden platform - the only remaining piece of his home. Soft-spoken with weathered skin and a buzzcut, Quirindongo pondered his limited options. “I know this isn’t a good place for a house,” said Quirindongo, who survives on U.S. government assistance. “Sometimes I would like to go to another place, but I can’t afford anything.” Villa Hugo reflects a much larger crisis in this impoverished U.S. territory, where so-called “informal” homes are estimated to house about half the population of 3.4 million. Some residents built on land they never owned. Others illegally subdivided properties, often so family members could build on their lots. Most have no title to their homes, which are constructed without permits and usually not up to building codes. The houses range in quality and size, from one-room shacks to sizable family homes. Many have plumbing and power, though not always through official means. (For a Wider Image photo essay on the island's post-Maria housing crisis, see: reut.rs/2EJmIq3 ) The concentration of illegal housing presents a vexing dilemma for local and federal authorities already overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding an economically depressed island after its worst natural disaster in nine decades. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stressed the need to “build back better,” a sentiment echoed by U.S. disaster relief and housing officials. But rebuilding to modern standards or relocating squatters to new homes would take an investment far beyond reimbursing residents for lost property value. It’s an outlay Puerto Rico’s government says it can’t afford, and which U.S. officials say is beyond the scope of their funding and mission. Yet the alternative - as Villa Hugo shows - is to encourage rebuilding of the kind of substandard housing that made the island so vulnerable to Maria in the first place. “It’s definitely a housing crisis,” said Fernando Gil, Puerto Rico’s housing secretary. “It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it.” In Puerto Rico, housing is by far the largest category of storm destruction, estimated by the island government at about $37 billion, with only a small portion covered by insurance. That’s more than twice the government’s estimate for catastrophic electric grid damage, which was made far worse by the shoddy state of utility infrastructure before the storm. Puerto Rico officials did not respond to questions about how the territory estimated the damage to illegally built homes. Maria destroyed or significantly damaged more than a third of about 1.2 million occupied homes on the island, the government estimates. Most of those victims had no hazard insurance - which is only required for mortgage-holders in Puerto Rico - and no flood insurance. Just 344,000 homes on the island have mortgages, according U.S. Census Bureau data. Officials at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) acknowledged the unique challenges of delivering critical housing aid to Puerto Rico. Among them: calculating the damage to illegal, often substandard homes; persuading storm victims to follow through on application processes that have frustrated many into giving up; and allocating billions in disaster aid that still won’t be nearly enough solve the island’s housing crisis. By far the most money for Puerto Rico housing aid is expected to come from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD spokeswoman Caitlin Thompson declined to comment on how the agency would spend billions of dollars in disaster relief funds to rebuild housing, or how it planned to help owners of informally built homes. Two HUD officials overseeing the agency’s Puerto Rico relief efforts, Todd Richardson and Stan Gimont, also declined to comment. But the disaster aid package currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would provide far less housing aid than Puerto Rico officials say they need. Governor Rosselló is seeking $46 billion in aid from HUD, an amount that dwarfs previous allocations for even the most destructive U.S. storms. That’s nearly half the island’s total relief request of $94 billion. The U.S. House of Representatives instead passed a package of $81 billion, with $26 billion for HUD, that still needs Senate and White House approval. The money would be divided between regions struck by several 2017 hurricanes - including Maria, Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida - as well as the recent California wildfires. Congress could also decide to approve additional aid later. ‘MY MOTHER IS SCARED’ A generation ago, Maria Vega Lastra, now 61, was among the estimated 28,000 people displaced by Hurricane Hugo. Neighbors helped her build a new home in what would become Villa Hugo, in the town of Canóvanas. Her daughter, 34-year-old Amadaliz Diaz, still recalls her older brother grinning as he sawed wood for the frame of their self-built, one-floor house, with a porch and three bedrooms. Now, Vega Lastra’s roof has holes in it, and her waterlogged wooden floorboards buckle with each step. Vega Lastra has been staying with her daughter, who lives in Tampa, as the family waits on applications for FEMA aid. The agency initially denied her application in December, saying it could not contact her by phone, Diaz said. Vega Lastra is returning to her home this week, uncertain if its condition has gotten worse. Her daughter bought her an air mattress to take with her. “My mother is scared,” Diaz said. “I hope the government helps her. I work, but I have three kids to take care of.” The island’s housing crisis long predated the storm. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency data, Puerto Rico’s index of new home prices fell 25 percent over the last decade, amid a severe recession that culminated last May in the largest government bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. Legal home construction, meanwhile, plummeted from nearly 16,000 new units in 2004 to less than 2,500 last year, according to consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, an economic data firm. A 2007 study by environmental consultant Interviron Services Inc, commissioned by the Puerto Rico Builders Association, found that 55 percent of residential and commercial construction was informal. That would work out to nearly 700,000 homes. That figure might be high, said David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rico Planning Society, a trade group representing community planners. But even a “very conservative” estimate would yield at least 260,000 illegally built houses, he said. Generations of Puerto Rican governments never made serious efforts to enforce building codes to stop new illegal housing, current and former island officials said in interviews. Past administrations had little political or economic incentive to force people out of neighborhoods like Villa Hugo. Former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, in office during Hurricane Hugo, said he tried to help informal homeowners without policing them. “Our policy was not to relocate, but rather improve those places,” Hernandez Colon said in an interview. Subsequent administrations advocated similar policies; none made meaningful headway, partly because of Puerto Rico’s constant political turnover.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez Today, informal communities provide a stark contrast to San Juan’s glittering resorts and bustling business districts. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz pointed to poor barrios like those near the city’s Martín Peña Channel, hidden behind the skyscrapers of the financial hub known as the Golden Mile. “It’s not something I’m proud of, but we hide our poverty here,” Cruz said in an interview. RECOVERY DILEMMA The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico’s housing stock ultimately falls to the territory government, which has no ability to pay for it after racking up $120 billion in bond and pension debt in the years before the storm. That leaves the island dependent on U.S. relief from FEMA, the SBA and HUD. The SBA offers low-interest home repair loans of up to $200,000. FEMA provides homeowners with emergency grants, relocation assistance and other help. HUD is focused on long-term rebuilding efforts, working directly with local agencies to subsidize reconstruction through grants. FEMA’s cap for disaster aid to individuals is $33,300, and actual awards are often much lower. Normally, FEMA eligibility for housing aid requires proving property ownership, but the agency says it will help owners of informal homes if they can prove residency. How exactly to help gets complicated. For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA’s deputy federal coordinating officer. Squatters who built on land they didn’t own, however, would likely only be given money to cover lost items and relocate to a rental, he said. Several Villa Hugo residents said they received money from FEMA, but many didn’t know what it was for and complained it wasn’t enough. Lourdes Rios Romero, 59, plans to appeal the $6,000 grant she got for repairs to her flooded home, citing a much higher contractor’s quote. Neighbor Miguel Rosario Lopez, a 62-year-old retiree, showed a statement from FEMA saying he was eligible for $916.22, “to perform essential repairs that will allow you to live in your home.” Without money for major changes, most homeowners said they planned to combine the aid they might get from FEMA with what little money they could raise to rebuild in the same spot. FEMA does not police illegal building. Code enforcement is left to the same local authorities who have allowed illegal construction to persist for years.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez Quirindongo is planning to buy materials to rebuild his Villa Hugo home himself with about $4,000 from FEMA. It will be the third time he has done so, having lost one home to a 2011 flood, another to a fire. “I just want to have something that I can say, ‘This is mine,’” Quirindongo said. GIVING UP Many others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agency’s application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes. FEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMA’s cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening. Applicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process - but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan. FEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1.1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows. “As soon as people see SBA they say, ‘I give up, I don’t want a loan - I can’t afford a loan,’” FEMA’s Hernandez said. SBA spokeswoman Carol Chastang said the agency is working with FEMA to educate flood victims on available benefits and the application process, including sending staffers to applicants’ homes. 330,000 VACANT HOMES Before the storm hit, Puerto Rico already had about 330,000 vacant homes, according to Census Bureau 2016 estimates, resulting from years of population decline as citizens migrated to the mainland United States and elsewhere. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the mainland at will. Puerto Rico and federal officials have considered rehabilitating the vacant housing for short- and long-term use, along with building new homes and buying out homeowners in illegally built neighborhoods, according to Gil and federal officials. Rosselló, the Puerto Rican governor, has said the rebuilding plan must include a fleet of properly built new homes. Gil, the housing secretary, said the administration would like to build as many as 70,000 properties. HUD officials declined to comment on whether the agency would finance new housing. Its Community Development Block Grant program allows for local governments to design their own solutions and seek HUD approval for funding. The cost of constructing enough new, code-compliant properties to house people displaced by Maria could far exceed the available federal aid. Making them affordable also presents a problem. Puerto Rico’s subsidized “social interest housing,” geared toward low-income buyers, typically provides units that sell in the mid-$100,000 range, with prices capped by the government. That’s beyond the means of many displaced storm victims. Gil offered little detail on a solution beyond saying it will include a mix of new development, buyout programs for owners of illegally built homes and other options. The answer will come down to how much Washington is willing to pay, he said. He invoked the island’s territorial status and colonial history as a root cause of its poor infrastructure and housing stock before the storm. “It is precisely because we have been neglected by the federal government that the island’s infrastructure is so weak,” he said. Many Puerto Rico officials continue to advocate for bringing relief and legitimacy to squatter communities like Villa Hugo, rather than trying to relocate their residents. Canovanas Mayor Lornna Soto has been negotiating with island officials to provide property titles to Villa Hugo’s population. The vast majority still don’t have them. “It’s long overdue to recognize that they are not going anywhere and their communities need to be rebuilt with proper services,” Soto said. Diaz said she supports her mother’s decision to return to Villa Hugo, regardless of what aid the government ultimately provides. “I grew up there,” Diaz said. “Everyone knows us there.” Reporting by Nick Brown in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico; editing by Brian Thevenot","CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo.

EILEEN SULLIVAN,"The death toll in Puerto Rico had been officially recorded as 64 for nearly a year, despite convincing evidence that the figure was too low because official death certificates had failed to take into account the long-range impacts of the storm. In August, after a thorough review, Puerto Rican officials accepted a revised estimate of the dead as 2,975. Mr. Trump’s Twitter screed was the latest in a string of callous remarks he has made about the deaths in Puerto Rico, which have caused even some of his allies to cringe. In an interview on Wednesday, Thomas Bossert, Mr. Trump’s former homeland security adviser, conceded that the president’s self-congratulation about his handling of the storms in Puerto Rico should have been tempered with compassion. “The missing part was empathy,” Mr. Bossert said. “I wish he’d paused and expressed that, instead of just focusing on the response success.” On the other hand, Mr. Bossert said, expressing the view held privately by many still serving in the Trump administration, attributing the thousands of deaths in Puerto Rico purely to the storm is a tricky business. “The people that died — thousands of people — it’s terrible, but it’s always difficult to talk about the causality of that death,” Mr. Bossert said. He argued that the link between some of the fatalities reported and the storms might have been “correlative, and not necessarily causal,” such as in the case of a person with a heart condition who died in the months afterward because of lack of sufficient access to clean water, electricity or medical care.","The president accused Democrats of inflating the death toll from Hurricane Maria, saying only six to 18 people died “after” the storm hit the island; the official toll is 3,000.",2018-09-13T13:24:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Rejects Death Toll in Puerto Rico Reported by His Own Government,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/trump-denies-puerto-rico-death-roll.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/us/14dc-trump/14dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The unexpected friendship between Randi Weingarten and Bill Horan might sound like the beginning of a joke: The president of the American Federation of Teachers — a progressive union leader who happens to be a lesbian married to a rabbi — and the president of the Christian nonprofit humanitarian organization Operation Blessing, founded by the controversial evangelical Pat Robertson, both walk into a bar. Can you guess what happens next? Unlike the classic joke, Weingarten and Horan didn't meet in a bar. They were introduced to each other last year, in the wake of Hurricane Maria, by Carmen Yulín Cruz (the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, whom you may remember went toe-to-toe with Donald Trump). What happened next may surprise — and delight — you. SEE ALSO: Lin-Manuel Miranda creates arts fund for Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria Operation Blessing, which specializes in disaster relief, had been on the ground for two weeks in Puerto Rico, working to supply residents with water filters, among other essential goods and services. Power failures meant water treatment plants couldn't operate, so they'd focused on that urgent need at Cruz's request. Then Weingarten arrived in San Juan. She was particularly distressed by school closures, which spelled instability for students across the island. She went to Cruz with one question: What can we do? Cruz pointed the union president in Horan's direction and suggested she work with Operation Blessing to get clean drinking water into schools so they could reopen. So Horan and Weingarten rushed to form the partnership they called Operation Agua, a campaign to deliver 100,000 water filtration systems to dozens of communities throughout Puerto Rico. The gravity-fed filters are meant for households or community settings and can produce up to 10 gallons of clean water per day. Randi Weingarten (left); Evelyn DeJesus, vice president of AFT; and Bill Horan (right) at the Operation Agua hub in 2017. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing ""We may be strange bedfellows, but it’s rare that people can just park whatever their political persuasions and ideology may be and try to help people in trouble, and that’s what happened here,"" says Horan, who retired from Operation Blessing this year. Weingarten first suggested raising money for the effort through AFT's disaster relief fund. Then Operation Blessing could use that money to pay for more filters and filtration devices, which it was already obtaining at a discount from the bath and kitchen manufacturing company Kohler. Weingarten appealed to union members to pitch in. That took the pressure off Operation Blessing to fundraise. By the time Hurricane Maria struck in mid-September last year, following the devastation wrought by Irma and Harvey, the nonprofit began to see a ""donor fatigue"" dip in contributions for hurricane relief. Horan says AFT's fundraising — which has totaled about $2 million — likely doubled Operation Blessing's impact in Puerto Rico. Weingarten also secured support from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Seafarers International Union (SIU); and the Asociación de Maestros de Puerto Rico (AMPR), the island's teachers union. Members of those organizations, as well as the Hispanic Federation, ultimately helped distribute the filters directly to communities in need. Map of filter distribution events. Black pushpins mark places where Operation Agua handed out filters. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing It wasn't long before TOTE Maritime, one of two shipping companies that operates vessels to and from Puerto Rico, agreed to send containers full of filtration systems from the U.S. to the island pro bono. Operation Blessing put its own expertise managing inventory and logistics to use. Operating out of a warehouse in San Juan, the nonprofit coordinated the distribution of shipping containers that arrived at the port, and received additional support from members of SIU. Amancio Crespo, the SIU representative at the port, embraced his new calling. Acting as a conduit between the vessels, ship operators, and local communities, he ensured that filters made it to their intended destinations as quickly as possible. He tapped local union members to identify churches and community organizations whose members needed filtration devices. Sometimes Crespo, the son of a Pentecostal minister, loaded up his own Dodge RAM 150 truck with pallets of filters and drove them to churches of all denominations where he had personal relationships. Hundreds of people would gather to receive a filter. ""The job was done right because it wasn’t just depending on one agency or one group of people — everyone deserves recognition,"" he says. ""I think we touched a lot of lives."" Operation Agua filter distributions in November 2017, in partnership with the Hispanic Federation. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing By Christmas break, members of the AMPR had reached more than 270,000 students by distributing 3,849 water filters to most schools on the island. Operation Blessing trained members of the teachers union to assemble and clean the filters. The containers are reusable and the replaceable filters last for a year of continuous use, which means classrooms may well turn to them again in the wake of a hurricane. By the end of August, the group expects to bring the remaining 6,500 filtration systems to the island to meet the original distribution goal. Weingarten and Horan forged what they hope is a lasting bond — and a model that people on different points of the political spectrum might consider emulating to help those in need. ""If you meet people where they are, and if you work on a values proposition — that in America we care about families and we care about their health and safety — then you can work with all sorts of strange bedfellows,"" says Weingarten, echoing Horan's phrase. ""It starts creating trust and lessening the divisiveness in this country."" Scene from an Operation Agua distribution event Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing It certainly helped, Weingarten and Horan say, that Cruz played matchmaker. Both of them trusted her vision and leadership. The campaign was also an effort to leverage Operation Blessing's logistics expertise and the AFT's vast union network in the name of bringing vulnerable people clean drinking water — a mission in which political fault lines are much easier to avoid than developing an alliance around, say, policy. At a time when unions possess significantly diminished political power, Weingarten says what happened in Puerto Rico is a testament to their impact in local communities. ""We are a family, and caring is an important aspect of being part of a union,"" she ways. ""We're fighting for things like wages and parental leave, but it’s also about caring and showing up."" AFT has done previous relief work during other disasters, but the organization now has a ""very robust"" process for determining how it can contribute, says Weingarten. Neither she or Horan know exactly how they'll partner together in the future, but both are hopeful their connection will endure. ""There was cooperation at every level,"" says Horan. ""No one cares who’s voting for who in the next election when it’s that type of cooperation.""",The unexpected friendship between Randi Weingarten and Bill Horan might sound like the beginning of a joke: The president of the American Federation of Teachers — a progressive union leader who happens to be a lesbian married to a rabbi — and the president of…,2018-08-07T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",How a lesbian union president and evangelical nonprofit leader teamed up to get Puerto Rico clean water,https://mashable.com/2018/08/07/clean-water-puerto-rico-operation-agua/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7C5mz1Zk_LCEvrp3J-ia-kDNfNA=/1200x630/2018%2F08%2F06%2Fc0%2Fe55daaffac9841178eca97c129ba4ed5.b609f.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Hurricane Maria,1

José Calderón,"This week marks one year since Hurricane Maria tore through the Caribbean islands. As president of the Hispanic Federation, I am marking this somber anniversary by helping to launch a new campaign called "" Take Action for Puerto Rico! "" to ensure the island and its people have the financial and moral support they need to thrive. What I've seen in my multiple visits to Puerto Rico over the last 12 months has convinced me that human resilience, optimism, and community organizing will always outlast tragedy, but more work needs to be done. SEE ALSO: How a lesbian union president and evangelical nonprofit leader teamed up to get Puerto Rico clean water In Puerto Rico, the devastation was as wide as it was deep. Power lines snapped under ferocious winds and roads were washed away by torrential downpours and mudslides. Roofs were ripped off homes, aggravating an already deepening housing crisis. The island's electrical grid, weakened by Hurricane Irma some weeks earlier and by years of neglect, was completely shattered, leaving millions to fend for themselves during what became the longest power outage in U.S. history. Human resilience, optimism, and community organizing will always outlast tragedy Words fail to describe the damage done to the island's inhabitants. Businesses closed. Schools were shuttered. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans, suddenly homeless and jobless, left the island for the mainland. Most heartbreaking of all, we know now that some 3,000 or more Puerto Ricans died as a direct result of the storm or its aftermath. Claims of ""fake news"" notwithstanding, the personal stories of those deaths and the tragedy that unfolded on the island in the storm's wake are just now coming into focus. Given the bleak landscape of post-Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico, it's easy to fall into anguish and despondency. And yet, even if the challenges seem insurmountable, Puerto Ricans have displayed an almost superhuman level of resiliency that should inspire us all. Faced with a terrible natural disaster and with a patently insufficient federal response, Puerto Ricans have demonstrated that the future of the island will be led by local communities determined to build a new Puerto Rico. In February of this year, I traveled to Yauco, a town located in southwestern Puerto Rico. I was introduced to the work of the Centro Microempresas y Tecnologías Agrícolas Sustentables (CMTAS), a 70-acre education center for agricultural microenterprises that supports local communities and farmers through sustainable technology. The organization's leaders understood that if Puerto Rico was ever to recover from the hurricane it would have to strengthen its agricultural sector. We were so impressed by CMTAS' vision that they became one of our first grantees. The organization received emergency funds to provide furniture and appliances to over 30 small farmers and their families who lost their homes. It distributed solar lamps, water filters, mosquito nets, and food to thousands of families. The funding allowed the organization to construct a solarized well that will provide the community of Quebradas in Yauco and those in surrounding areas with clean water. They will be better prepared in the event of another disaster. Our support helped CMTAS restore pathways, fencing, and a hydroponic station on its model farm, replace livestock lost in the storm, and repair its teaching building so that it could reopen its school. Hispanic Federation is also helping install a pilot anaerobic bio-digester which will supply a free source of renewable, biogas energy to 15 nearby homes and the CMTAS school. Its goal is to develop an agro-tourism business that will help sustain these and other projects. Volunteers from the United States and Spain help rebuild a home in Quebradillas, Puerto Rico. Image: Monica Tavares / hispanic federation There are hundreds of other projects just like these across the island: Puerto Rican-led initiatives designed to strengthen Puerto Rico. Thanks to the generosity of more than 200,000 donors to our Unidos Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund, we were on the ground just a couple of days after the storm providing relief, coordinating with local groups to get aid to where it was needed most, and serving as a vital bridge between worried Puerto Ricans on the mainland and isolated Puerto Ricans on the island. We were able to deliver over 7 million pounds of food, water, and critical supplies to all of the island's 78 municipalities. We coordinated 25 relief flights carrying medicine, first responders, and solar panels to aid those without electricity. We conducted medical evacuations and missions, bringing individuals in critical care to mainland U.S. hospitals and much-needed doctors and nurses to the people on the island. In less than a year we have committed $30 million dollars to community-based relief and reconstruction projects that are building a fairer and more resilient Puerto Rico. A farmer in Cayey, Puerto Rico, leading Hispanic Federation staff on a tour of land devastated by Hurricane Maria. Image: Monica Tavares / hispanic federation As much as I can be proud of Hispanic Federation's efforts in Puerto Rico, and humbled by the solidarity of hundreds of thousands of people who gave time and treasure to support Puerto Ricans in their time of need, what makes me prouder still is to have witnessed the determination and creativity of Puerto Ricans who refuse to surrender their island to the storm. Yet in order to see local initiatives and projects through to fruition, Puerto Rico needs help — a great deal of help. The kind of help that only a significant federal investment can provide. Unfortunately, the federal response to the crisis on the island has been inhumane and inadequate. That's why this week we are joining with 250 organizations across the United States for the month-long "" Take Action for Puerto Rico !"" campaign. We are all coming together to demand a recovery plan for the island that is just and sustainable, and to call on the federal government to finally honor its responsibility and duty to the people of Puerto Rico. While the events taking place during the campaign will vary, all of the participating groups have committed to take action around four critical pillars for Puerto Rico's recovery: empowered community, health care equity, climate change preparedness, and economic redevelopment. So many of us want to help Puerto Rico get back on its feet, and to stand stronger than before. We can do that by supporting Puerto Rican recovery efforts that are grounded in local realities and local needs. Our campaign does that, with the aim of achieving maximum impact for Puerto Ricans living on the island. This moment, though born from catastrophe, has brought us an opportunity to fundamentally change Puerto Ricans' lives for the better. Let's not waste it. José Calderón is president of the Hispanic Federation. The mission of the Hispanic Federation is to empower and advance the Hispanic community.","This week marks one year since Hurricane Maria tore through the Caribbean islands.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Subtropical storm Alberto picked up pace ahead of the official hurricane season Thousands have been evacuated from the coast of Florida as the region braces for subtropical storm Alberto. Anticipated to make landfall on Monday, Alberto is the first storm ahead of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which formally starts on 1 June. It will bring heavy rain and winds of 100kmh (65mph) across southern states, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 185km (115 miles) south-west of Florida's Panama City, at 01:00 CET (6:00GMT). Alberto had picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, bringing with it the warning of life-threatening inundation, said the Miami-based hurricane centre. It is forecast to drop as much as 30cm (12in) of rain across Mississippi to western Georgia and to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm (2-4ft) to low-lying areas. Alberto comes during the Memorial Day weekend, and is expected to affect travel on Monday, when many people will return from their holidays. It is the first named storm of the season, with 21 other names still to be used, including Beryl, Ernesto, Kirk, Nadine and Rafael. Last year, a number of deadly hurricanes hit the US and Caribbean.

Marcus Gilmer,"It's been nearly two months since Category 4 Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico, leaving behind immense devastation. On Wednesday morning, the island took another step backward, as the lights went off in San Juan once again. Shortly after the storm, the island's government signed a controversial $300 million deal with a little-known Montana company known as Whitefish Energy to restore power to parts of the island. Yet the island continues to experience major problems with its fragile electrical grid. As of Monday morning, power had been restored to about 50 percent of the island. That's when a power line known as the Cambalache Manatee line failed, again, plunging San Juan into darkness. Confirmed: power out in Puerto Rico - Cause unknown, as of now. It just so happens, that Gov. @ricardorossello had been heralding November 15th (today) as a goal of being at 50% generation, on the 56th day after Maria. https://t.co/4ycaEfSFQS — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) November 15, 2017 Se reporta falla en línea de 230KV de Cambalache a Manatí.

CC6 — AEE (@AEEONLINE) November 15, 2017 This is the second time in a week that this particular line has failed, affecting the parts of Puerto Rico that actually had restored power.

As Mashable's own Andrew Freedman noted, the $300 million contract breaks down like so: The wages and equipment charges in this contract are extremely high. According to the contract, site supervisors are earning $330 an hour for their work, while project accountants are earning $440 per hour. The lowest-paid workers, according to the contract, are making $140.26 an hour. By comparison, minimum wage in Puerto Rico is $7.25 an hour. According to Indeed.com, the average salary for a journeyman electrical lineman is $39.03 per hour in the continental U.S. However, a journeyman lineman on Whitefish Energy's Puerto Rico project will earn $277.88 per hour. Those are big bucks for work on a line that seems to be repeatedly failing.

GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Jimmy Fallon taped Tuesdays Tonight Show in Puerto Rico, and things got going with a bang. During the opening sequence, Fallon joined Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of Hamilton in the theater in San Juan where theyre currently performing the musical. Then, along with Questlove and Black Thought of the Roots, he wandered into downtown San Juan, where he met up with the singer Bad Bunny. An impromptu dance party started.
Later in the show, Fallon interviewed Miranda about his decision to bring Hamilton to Puerto Rico, where the playwright and actors father is from. Miranda talked about the resonances between the subject matter in Hamilton and the experiences of Puerto Ricans.
Theres a song in this show called Hurricane, and I could barely get through it last night, because it is about that, he said. What I remember from Hurricane Maria so vividly was the quiet was, like, literally not being able to hear from the island in that sort of immediate aftermath. And the opening line to that song is, In the eye of a hurricane, theres quiet. So it sort of brought all that back. He said he hadnt imagined it would resonate in this particular way.

Adrian Florido,"Rafaela Serrano's house in the municipality of Caguas is still roofless eight months after Hurricane Maria. Countless homes on the island remain damaged two weeks before the start of the next hurricane season. Adrian Florido/NPR Standing at a lectern before reporters Thursday, Carlos Acevedo, the head of Puerto Rico's emergency management agency, made an admission. Before Hurricane Maria, he said, the island's government did not take updates to its hurricane response plans seriously. ""Before Maria, updating our plans was very easy,"" Acevedo said. ""We would take the first and last pages, remove them, replace them with new pages, sign them, and there was the new plan."" It came as no surprise then, Acevedo said, that the government's outdated and recycled plan – written for a Category 1 hurricane – was wholly inadequate to guide its response after Hurricane Maria's category 4 winds devastated the island last September. ""I'm very honest,"" Acevedo went on. ""The plan did not say what we would do if the communication systems failed."" Which they did, thwarting the government's ability to coordinate a response. The reason he'd called reporters to the agency's headquarters on the outskirts of San Juan was to get the word out that all that had changed. The agency was finalizing a process that Acevedo said it had never before undertaken. It had re-written its hurricane response plan ""from zero."" Two weeks before the start of hurricane season, local and federal officials in Puerto Rico are eager to assure the island's residents that the government is better prepared than it has ever been to respond should another hurricane hit. But across the island, and especially in communities still recovering from Hurricane Maria, many residents are highly skeptical. It took Rafaela Serrano eight months to save enough to fix her home. She's finally got the money, but says she'll wait until the end of the next hurricane season, just in case. Adrian Florido/NPR ""Just look at my house,"" said Rafaela Serrano, who lives on a sloping cul-de-sac in the municipality of Caguas. Her roof is missing, the gaping hole covered by a blue tarp that federal relief workers installed shortly after the storm. Most of the homes in her neighborhood still display unrepaired damage eight months after the hurricane tore off roofs and blew out windows. ""A lot of people still haven't fixed their houses. So no, we are not prepared for another hurricane,"" Serrano said. Nonetheless, officials insist they are well prepared. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it has added four new warehouses across the island and filled them with millions of emergency meals and bottles of water and tens of thousands of tarps. Before Hurricane Maria, FEMA had just one warehouse on the island, which made supply distribution difficult. And in the weeks ahead the agency plans to give additional supplies to each of the island's 78 municipalities, so mayors can begin responding immediately should their communities once again be cut off in a storm's aftermath. FEMA is also urging residents to create their own emergency plans, and to stock enough supplies to last ten days. Officials also said they have pre-positioned emergency generators at critical facilities like police and fire stations and hospitals. And Sandra Torres, head of the agency that regulations telecommunications on the island, said work was under way to prevent another total collapse of the island's communication systems. That includes the installation of satellite communications systems at critical facilities and new radio antennas at more than 320 hospitals. She also said that more than 1,000 miles of fiber-optic cables had been buried underground. ""Undergrounding is so important,"" Torres said. ""Not depending on poles owned by the power utility will help a lot, because the weight of the cables had a lot to do with the collapse of that infrastructure."" One of the biggest concerns, of course, is the still fragile electrical grid. Roughly 18,000 homes on the island are still waiting for power, and on Friday, the last of the mainland restoration crews hired by the federal government will pack up and head home, leaving the rest of the job to PREPA, the island's electric utility company. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's non-voting member of Congress, had in the last week written two urgent letters requesting that FEMA extend the contract of those power crews so that the remaining homes could be energized more quickly. But on Thursday, Michael Byrne, FEMA's top officer in Puerto Rico, said no extension would be granted. Byrne said FEMA would, however, keep 700 emergency generators on the island, as well as the three massive generators hooked up to the island's major power plants. Despite all those preparations, Javier Solis said he was still worried. Javier Solis can't keep metal roofing panels in stock at his roadside hardware shop on the outskirts of San Juan. Adrian Florido/NPR Solis runs a roadside hardware store on the outskirts of San Juan. Every day, he has customers showing up to ask for the corrugated aluminum roofing panels that Hurricane Maria blew off of so many homes on the island. He's still having trouble stocking them, and when he does, they sell out within hours. Solis also makes deliveries. ""I've driven to so many places on the island,"" Solis said, including to areas still without power. ""And I've seen so many homes without roofs, people who are still waiting for help, people who don't have money for repairs, who all need the same thing but can't get it."" Solis thinks the only way that Puerto Rico will avoid massive destruction again is by evading another hurricane. ""Let's hope we don't get another one,"" Solis said. ""Because it's going to be difficult. It's going to be difficult.""","The head of the island's emergency management agency admits the government did not take hurricane preparation seriously before Hurricane Maria, but says all that's changed.",2018-05-18T02:31:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Puerto Rico Officials Say They're Ready for Hurricane Season, But Worries Mount",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/17/612203204/puerto-rico-officials-say-theyre-ready-for-hurricane-season-but-worries-mount,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/17/serrano-house_wide-3a8630ad6510065f8a3204d6bf436173e67aca0c.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane Maria,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","If there’s one thing you can count on Donald Trump to do, it is to take the most basic of presidential tasks and fuck it up. No, I’m not talking about the 9/11 photo. I’m talking about today’s Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Florence. Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen were there with some big charts that showed Florence’s potential impacts and track. All Trump had to do was look at them seriously, tell the people in the Carolinas the federal government will be there for them, and say that his administration would be monitoring the storm. Maybe offer some thoughts and prayers. Done! But no. After referring to Hurricane Florence as “tremendously big and tremendously wet” which was honestly funny and true, Trump decided to invoke Hurricane Maria, a tragedy that took approximately 3,000 Americans’ lives on his watch. And he invoked it in a way that is not good (a little emphasis added): “I think Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success. Texas, we have been given A-pluses for. Florida, we have been given A-pluses for. I think in a certain way, the best job we did was Puerto Rico, but nobody would understand that. It’s harder to understand. It was a very hard thing to do because of the fact that they had no electric before the storm hit, it was dead, as you probably know. So we’ve gotten a lot of receptivity, a lot of thanks for what we did in Puerto Rico.” In fact, the federal government did a piss poor job that was marred by scandal, threats of cutting relief, and a slow response that exacerbated American citizens’ suffering. When the president visited Puerto Rico weeks after the storm hit, he treated the trip like a three-point shooting contest. This isn’t the fist time Trump has lavished praise on his “fantastic” response. But if the response to Maria is what an unsung success looks like, lord help the people in Florence’s path. Hear it from the man himself:","If there’s one thing you can count on Donald Trump to do, it is to take the most basic of presidential tasks and fuck it up. No, I’m not talking about the 9/11 photo.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"To be sure, the recovery effort, after a slow start, wound up being substantial, and Puerto Rico’s shoddy infrastructure was one of many extenuating challenges. Even so, there is little question that things could have been handled much better — Mr. Trump’s memorable chucking of paper towels at devastated islanders notwithstanding. Even the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Government Accountability Office have found as much. Certainly, it must have been vexing, perhaps even confusing, for Mr. Trump last month when the storm’s death toll was revised sharply upward, from 64 people to 2,975. This shift was not a result of partisan trickery, but of the preliminary findings of a study by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. The study is continuing, meaning that the numbers could shift again. Mr. Trump seems incapable of processing new information or learning from mistakes. Instead, he did what he always does: reject inconvenient data in favor of a story in which he is the hero. In the president’s view, increases in the official death toll cannot possibly stem from a more comprehensive analysis. They must stem from yet another conspiracy by his political enemies. The 3,000 lives lost, in other words, are all about him. Democrats don’t need to lift a finger to make him look bad. He is managing that all on his own.

Timothy J. Seppala,"And since the companies are their own entities now, they each have an official leader. Alastair Westgarth will serve as CEO of Loon, while James Ryan Burgess will fill the same role at Wing. Prior to Loon, Westgarth was president and CEO at Quintel until early 2017, a cellular antenna company. Burgess has been with Google since late 2012.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","You might want to turn the sound on. I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it. New research released on Wednesday in Nature chronicled a bizarre experiment involving lizards from Turks and Caicos, a stick, and a leaf blower. The goal? To study how hurricanes influence natural selection, of course. Last year’s brutal hurricane season took a toll on wildlife in the Caribbean, as Hurricanes Irma and Maria rattled ecosystems from the Florida Everglades to Puerto Rico’s rainforest. Researchers are still digging into how wildlife bounced back from the pounding storms, but the new research goes one step further by looking at how the storms may have left an imprint on future generations of lizards in Turks and Caicos. Scientists’ ability to tease this out involved a weird twist of academic fate. An international team of researchers had been conducting studies of populations of Anolis scriptus lizards spread across two islands. They finished their fieldwork four days before Hurricane Irma slammed into their research sites with 165-mph winds. Two weeks later, Maria plowed through the area again with 124-mph winds. That gave scientists a rare opportunity to look at whether the lizards that survived were different, on average, from the pre-storm populations. They found that the lizards who weathered the storm had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs, and shorter back legs. The researchers hypothesize that the first two qualities allowed the lizards to cling for dear life with a stronger grip than their shrimpy-limbed brethren. Meanwhile, the shorter back legs allowed them to be more aerodynamic in the hurricane-force winds, acting like a wind sock rather than a piece of sheet metal. But why just hypothesize when you can test it out, amirite? The researchers took lizards to a lab of horrors to measure what they innocuously called “performance capacity.” In this case, it meant having the lizards do their best Jim Cantore impression by having them cling to a pole while a leaf blower tossed them about in hurricane-force winds (side note: leaf blowers are no joke apparently). Amazingly, the little buggers were able to hang on, even in winds up to 108 mph. While it may look like a lizard version of Saw, the researchers stressed that no lizards were harmed—when they finally lost their grip, they flew into a nice, soft net. All of them were returned to the locations where they had been collected. Even so, there’s no way to measure the psychological trauma potentially experienced by these poor lizards. The findings are the first of their kind to measure natural selection before and after a storm. In a world where climate change is projected to make hurricanes more intense, it could mean lizards are going to have to up their tree-hugging game if they want to survive.","I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it.

Mark Kaufman,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one. Forecasters say that there's a 70 percent chance that the season will be active with hurricanes, but it's unlikely that we'll see the extremes of 2017, when six major storms (which have sustained destructive winds of at least 111 mph ) roared through the Atlantic. ""Last year was extremely active,"" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. ""It was one of the strongest seasons on record."" SEE ALSO: Fighting climate change could save the world trillions of dollars This coming year, NOAA's analysis of long-term climate trends in the Atlantic Ocean, the temperature of the ocean, and other factors, don't add up to conditions that would stoke an extreme hurricane season. ""Right now we're not seeing any strong climate signals that say the season would be as strong as last year,"" said Bell. But, NOAA is seeing the signal for a season that is either ""normal"" or ""above normal."" There's just a 25 percent chance that the season will be ""below normal.""

Bell said that a ""normal"" season would be 10 to 12 named storms, with five to six total hurricanes, one or two of which would be major, devastating cyclones (think Hurricane Harvey or Irma). There's a reasonable chance, about 35 percent, that these storm numbers and intensities could be punched up a little more, however, and enter the ""above normal"" spectrum. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, though Bell notes the peak of the season is in August, September, and October. For this reason, NOAA will produce an updated forecast in early August. These are the names NOAA will use to name storms during this hurricane season. Image: NOAA The 2018 season begins as many areas are still reeling from the 2017 pummeling. Recovering from Hurricane Harvey alone has a price tag that exceeds $125 billion, according to NOAA. Puerto Rico is still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Maria, with more than 14,000 people still without power on the island, according to an ABC report. There are some 80 million Americans that live in hurricane territory, notes Bell, so he hopes people start preparing. This means getting flood insurance, having an evacuation plan, downloading the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app, and heeding warnings. Since 1995, the Atlantic has experienced a high amount of hurricane activity said Bell, in large part due to a decades-long climate trend occurring in Atlantic, called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which warmer waters produce stronger storms. Some studies also suggest that as human-caused climate change worsens, extreme weather events could become more frequent and severe.","On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• Hurricane Lane was expected to bring tropical storm and hurricane-force winds to parts of Hawaii, with up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. • President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the State of Hawaii on Thursday morning, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts. • The state’s 15 airports were set to remain open during the storm, barring infrastructure damage. As of Thursday morning, flightaware.com reported some delays at airports across the islands. The approach of Hurricane Lane is the third time in less than a year that Hawaii has braced for potential disaster. In January, an errant emergency alert about an incoming ballistic missile triggered an island-wide panic. In May, the Kilauea Volcano began to erupt, sending lava rolling over roads and homes in the same area that is now under a flash flood watch. Photo Alex Krivoulian, right, stocked up on water in Honolulu. Residents have been advised to gather supplies of food and water that could last them as long as 14 days. Credit Kat Wade/Getty Images And yet, with strong hurricanes rare in this part of the world, the threat of Hurricane Lane felt new and deeply unsettling to some residents, who heeded the National Weather Service’s advice that preparations to safeguard life and property should be “rushed to completion.” “Maui has not faced anything like this before. It’s serious,” Audrey Reed, 76, a resident of that island, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got everything we need: batteries, water, canned and dry foods, medication, first-aid kit, flashlights. It’s just a matter now of hunkering down and trying to ride it out.” Hawaii’s remote geography and mountainous terrain could pose challenges for recovery in the event of widespread damage, and Gov. Ige urged people to have a 14-day supply of food before the storm. Hurricane Lane arrives as other parts of the nation are still recovering from the megastorms of 2017. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston almost exactly one year ago, causing dozens of deaths and catastrophic flooding, and it was followed by Hurricane Irma’s wallop to Florida. Then came Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which may have killed more than 1,400 people, according to one analysis, and caused massive power outages. Some of the last customers were still getting their power back earlier this month.

Marcus Gilmer,"Just when you thought President Donald Trump couldn't drag the country further into the dumpster fire of 2018, he found a way.

SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is growing: 5 things to know about the monster storm And, somehow, he played the politics card by blaming Democrats for the count, unbelievably making the deaths of 3,000 Americans a partisan issue. 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico.

In August, a George Washington University study put the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Maria at 2,975 people. The government of Puerto Rico accepted these numbers, too, after many months in which the official death toll was listed at 64 people. The storm laid waste to the island, leaving many residents without potable water or power for months. It's another unconscionable ego play by Trump, who's refusing to acknowledge a (literal) disaster that happened under his watch. It's either an unwillingness to accept the truth or a complete misunderstanding of the reality that many deaths likely came after the storm due to a lack of medical and public services. With his comments on Thursday, Trump didn't just kick a hornets nest — instead, he bludgeoned it with a barbed-wire baseball bat and outrage exploded across Twitter.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — An explosion and fire at an electric substation threw much of northern Puerto Rico into darkness late Sunday in a setback for the territory’s efforts to fully restore power more than five months after Hurricane Maria started one of the longest blackouts in United States history. The island’s Electric Power Authority said several municipalities were without power, including parts of the capital, San Juan, but officials were optimistic it could be restored within a day as they worked to repair a substation that controls voltage. The blast illustrated the challenges of restoring a power grid that was already crumbling before it was devastated by Maria, a Category 4 hurricane. In many cases, power workers are repairing equipment that should have long been replaced but remained online because of the power authority’s yearslong financial crisis. The power authority is worth roughly $4 billion, carries $9 billion in debt and has long been criticized for political patronage and inefficiency. It also struggled with frequent blackouts, including an island-wide outage in September 2016. It was not immediately known what caused Sunday’s fire, which was quickly extinguished. Officials said the explosion knocked two other substations offline and caused a total loss of 400 megawatts worth of generation. Heavy black smoke billowed from the substation as neighbors in the area described on social media seeing the sky turn orange following a loud explosion. San Juan Mayor Carmen Cruz posted on Twitter that no injuries had been reported and that power had been restored in some areas of the city.

"Rachel Ventresca, CNN","Washington (CNN) The governor of Puerto Rico said Thursday there is no doubt that there were nearly 3,000 deaths as a result of Hurricane Maria, disputing President Donald Trump's assertion that the figure was artificially inflated.

Ricardo Rosselló told CNN's Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto on ""CNN Newsroom."" In August, researchers at George Washington University published a report estimating nearly 2,975 people died between September 2017 and February 2018 as a result of the storm. CNN's own reporting reflects similar numbers. The new figure marked a sharp escalation from numbers released by the Puerto Rican government in December 2017, which said 64 people had died due to the storm.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm. The tropics have gone wild, with three hurricanes spinning at the same time, as you can see for yourself in satellite imagery captured as the sun rose on the Atlantic Monday morning. In addition to rapidly-strengthening Florence (which just hit Category 3 status), Helene and Isaac became hurricanes on Sunday. More than 2,000 miles separates the three hurricanes so the only way to view them all together is from space. Luckily, there’s a way to do that thanks to GOES 16. The next generation satellite was launched last year with the express intent of improving our view of hurricanes to improve forecasts. But it also provides one hell of a view to the public, showing what our planet is capable of from a vantage point of more than 22,000 miles above the Earth’s surface. GOES 16 also has the ability to zoom in on specific hurricanes, providing close-up views that are equal parts beautiful and harrowing. The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration released imagery on Monday showing the sun rise over the eye of hurricane Florence. The swirl of clouds around the hurricane’s center, which is starting to clear out, are a sign it’s strengthening as expected. If robots in space aren’t enough, may I offer you one last view courtesy of astronauts? The International Space Station passed over the Atlantic on Monday morning, and astronaut Ricky Arnold shared the absolutely wild images of Florence in a tweet on Monday morning. This the eleventh time on record that three hurricanes have been active at the same time in the Atlantic. The most recent time was last year, when Irma, Jose and Maria all reached hurricane status at the same time. The scars of Irma and Maria are still clear in the Caribbean and Florida. The forecasts for Florence and Isaac are disconcerting as well, making it hard to really savor the views from space. While Helene is likely to steer off into the central Atlantic and poses no immediate risk to land, Florence is rapidly strengthening and is likely to reach the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic by Thursday as a very strong hurricane with a major storm surge risk. It’s quite possible it could stall out over land and dump copious rainfall inland, creating the potential for historic flooding. Meanwhile, Isaac is plowing toward the Caribbean and the Lesser Antilles. While it’s a small hurricane, it could still bring rain and storm surge to a number of islands from Barbados to Antigua. Puerto Rico is also within the storm’s forecast cone, though there’s a lot that can happen between now and this weekend to change its exact track. Still, it’s a storm that bears watching.","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm.

Daniel Bases,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island’s infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria. A crane is seen inside a sinkhole caused by Hurricane Maria at a construction site along Puerto Rico Highway 2, outside San Juan, Puerto Rico, October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton “This is a conservative estimate based on similar efforts that have been done in New York, New Jersey and of course in Texas most recently,” Rossello said at a press conference streamed online from the National Governors Association in Washington. “Now, I am however confident that we have turned a corner. That we are now flowing out of the life sustainment phase and we are starting the recovery phase, and the rebuilding phase,” Rossello said. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Rossello said recovery from the storm, the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. commonwealth in 90 years, exceeded the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund and associated programs. At the top of priorities is $31.1 billion for housing, followed by $17.8 billion to rebuild and make more resilient the power grid. Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Congress Jenniffer González-Colón accompanied Rossello and said she introduced legislation to reform the disaster relief law known as the Stafford Act.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo The reform would allow disaster recovery money to be used to modernize infrastructure, not just return it to recent condition. Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was already weak. Restoring the power grid has been a top priority since Maria’s 150 mile per hour winds knocked it out completely on Sept. 20. Rossello and the island’s power authority, PREPA, were criticized for a no-bid contract with a tiny private firm, Whitefish Energy, for a portion of the repairs. Rossello canceled the contract on Oct. 29 after an uproar over its provisions. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest readings indicate 47.8 percent of power capacity has been restored. Puerto Rico’s economy was already in recession before Maria landed and its government filed for bankruptcy in the face of $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities. Rossello said the decisions Congress takes now will define “how successful we are in rebuilding Puerto Rico.” Reporting By Daniel Bases; Editing by Cynthia Osterman","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island's infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria.",2017-11-13T19:59:33Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Puerto Rico requests $94.4 billion from U.S. Congress for rebuilding,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-assistance/puerto-rico-requests-94-4-billion-from-u-s-congress-for-rebuilding-idUSKBN1DD2G8,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171113&t=2&i=1209656185&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAC1O6,reuters,Reuters,Hurricane Maria,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Adam Rogers,"Michael introduced itself to North America with 155-mile-per-hour gusts of wind and a barometric pressure of 919 millibars, the third-strongest hurricane to ever make continental US landfall. It was a monster, and it stayed a monster as it rolled through Georgia and then on toward the Carolinas. And monsters are made, not born. The most striking thing about Michael is that it was barely a tropical storm a couple of days ago, and all of a sudden it almost touched cat-5 intensity, says Karthik Balaguru, an oceanographer who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Typically hurricanes ramp up more slowly (if at all), and landfall reduces their intensity. The thing with Michael is, it just kept on intensifying, Balaguru says. Thats calledperhaps as youd expectrapid intensification, and it used to be a rare phenomenon among Atlantic hurricanes. Thats good, because rapidly intensifying hurricanes also tend to be the ones that are the most dangerous, the deadliest and the most expensive. Unfortunately, rapidly intensifying hurricanes seem to be a rarity no longer. Of the record-breaking hurricane season of 201717 named storms, 6 major hurricanesall four category-4 or 5 storms underwent rapid intensification. Thats Harvey, which drowned Houston, Irma, Jose, and Maria, which was so devastating to Puerto Rico. Now, to be fair, most Atlantic cat-4 and cat-5 storms go through rapid intensification; the dangerous ones do it near the coastline, just before landfall. More intense hurricanes are one of the central predictions scientists have made about Earths changing climate. Human beings pump more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the air, and the air changes. The planets overall temperature goes up, and that means, in part, more energy in the top of the oceans. Thats a hurricanes engine. Advances like satellites and radar have made high accuracy possible in predicting a hurricanes eventual track, the path it takes across ocean and land. Intensity, though, is another story. Its hardas the hurricane researcher Kerry Emanuel wrote last year, a good intensity prediction would require better numerical models, better understanding of boundary layers between air and water, and a better model of how the upper ocean interacts with storms. Scientists dont have any of those. Forecasting rapid intensification is even harder. And again, perhaps as one might expect, a warmer climate makes rapid intensification more likely. Emanuels group calculated from observations of past storms that a hurricane with wind speeds that grew 68 miles per hour in the day before making landfall should only happen once in a century under the conditions of an unchanged climatebasically a hundred-year storm. And the vulnerable cities were just about where youd expect, too: Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, Miami. But, the researchers then calculated, in the post climate-change climate of our Burning World, those storms could happen once every five years. And the new hundred-year storm? Pre-landfall intensifications of 114 mph, so massive as to be essentially nonexistent in the late twentieth-century climate, Emanuel writes. People will have never seen anything that bad. Balagurus group found similarly grim news. Their calculations, based again on observed rapid intensification, say that climate change and variations in Atlantic conditions could drive up the magnitude of that intensification. Point is, climate change means more rapid intensification like what Michael did, and worse. How did Michael pull it off? If I had to guess, Id say it experienced perfect conditions for a hurricanea lot of heat available in the ocean and favorable atmospheric conditions, Balaguru says. Wind shear, the changes in magnitude and direction of winds from the oceans surface all the way up to the top of the troposphereabout six miles upmust have also subsided. High enough wind shear can disrupt convection at the storms center, weakening it overall. That didnt happen here. The result: yet another perfect storm in yet another season of perfect storms, crashing into a heavily populated coastline full of environmental disasters waiting to happen. As of Thursday, Michael has ramped back down. Its merely a powerful tropical storm now. And its tracking right over the towns where Hurricane Florence made landfall last month.

Alexis Shaw,"July 9 (Reuters) - Tropical storm Chris, slowly moving along the coast of the Carolinas, is expected to build into a full-blown hurricane on Monday, while the former Hurricane Beryl dwindled into a heavy rainstorm as it crossed the northeastern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said. Chris, which formed off the North Carolina coast early on Sunday, is only expected to get stronger, the NHC said. Early Monday, it was blasting winds of 60 miles per hour as it moved at about 2 mph northward some 200 miles southeast off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ""Swells generated by Chris are expected to increase and affect portions of the coasts of North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states during the next few days,"" the NHC said. ""These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."" The leftover bits of Beryl looked set to bring two to three inches of rain to Puerto Rico, along with wind gusts up to 40 mph. SEE ALSO: NHC: Hurricane Beryl weakens to tropical storm as it approaches eastern Caribbean Sea The chances of Beryl reforming into a tropical storm were put near zero. The weather service discontinued posting advisories about the storm late Sunday. Tropical Storm Chris was expected to remain well off the U.S. coast, and the latest projections show it possibly making landfall in Nova Scotia late Wednesday or early Thursday. But the National Weather Service maintained a hazardous weather outlook for Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory still recovering from the devastation wrought last year by Hurricane Maria, warning of thunderstorms and wind gusts.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1, but preparedness season is in full swing. Or at least, it would be if the federal government wasnt shut down. 
Of all the trouble the shutdown has brought upon the weather community, this might be the most impactful. Putting the off-season on hold over Trumps imaginary border emergency could result in real life-and-death consequences if a hurricane strikes U.S. shores this year.
Last year saw two multi-billion dollar hurricanes hit the U.S.. The year before was the costliest hurricane season in history. Yet losses wouldve been much worse if not for National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the U.S. hurricane programimprovements, ranging from narrowing the cone of uncertainty that shows a storms projected path to refining response plans. The bulk of those improvements happen at this time of year, when the odds of hurricanes are low and scientists and program managers can turn to long-term projects. The NHC, along with a host of other federal agencies from the Environmental Monitoring Center to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) analyze data, tweak forecasts and models, and provide training to local emergency managers, all so every American can get better forecasts and evacuation warnings. 
All that has come to a grinding halt as the shutdown has dragged on.
We had a ton of projects we want to do, Eric Blake, the union steward for the NHC, told Earther. They keep getting whittled down one by one by one.
One of those projects is an annual training organized by FEMA in the winter and spring around the countrythat brings in people from local and state government responsible for creating and executing hurricane plans. They could be fire marshals, emergency managers, or politicians. The NHC assists with those trainings by providing some basic meteorological knowledge, including how its forecasts and products work and where to find them. The first training wouldve been last week, but it didnt happen due to the shutdown.
These people wear many hats, and now theyre missing one, Blake said of the emergency planners who are normally at the trainings. 
The loss of projects could be equally problematic for hurricane preparedness. The NHC added storm surge warnings to the suite of ways it communicates risk to the public in 2014. Those warnings arent yet operational for Puerto Rico, which was lashed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Blake said the agency had plans to extend storm surge warnings to the island in time for the 2019 season, but that efforts now on hold and could be scrapped completely.
The NHC cant even advertise jobs for the eight positions it currently has open,including lead marine forecaster, executive officer, and a handful of interns. For a chief scientist position it did have posted, the NHC cant hire anyone. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the NHC, said in a statement to Earther that the hurricane models werent slated for a major upgrade this year. But any slight tweaks and talks between the modelers and NHC staff, conversations that could inadvertently yield breakthroughs, are on hold while the shutdown wears on.
Projects like the Puerto Rico storm surge warnings could still happen depending on when the shutdown ends and job postings are still likely to go up, but theyll happen as federal workers face a backlog of work.
Not everyone is off the job, however. Blake and fellow employees deemed essential are working without pay to put out maritime forecasts for U.S. coasts and keeping an eye out for any oddball tropical storms that may form in the offseason. But theyre cut off from all their partners that would normally be working to prepare for hurricane season and putting American lives at risk. Blake likened it to a football game, which seems fitting given this weekends conference championships.
Lets say in the U.S. hurricane program, the National Hurricane Center would be a quarterback, he said. Youre not sending out rest of team. So what are you doing? Were basically standing still.
Blake and everyone else working on hurricanes will work like hell to be ready once the shutdown ends. But the longer it draws, the more likely theyll be using last years game plan. And even then, players could still be running around the locker room looking for their equipment when the lights go up on Atlantic hurricane season on June 1.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Roads turned to rivers across Houston as Harvey hit Scientists have weighed the water that fell on Texas during the record-breaking Hurricane Harvey in August. They calculate, by measuring how much the Earth was compressed, that the Category 4 storm dropped 127 billion tonnes, or 34 trillion gallons. ""One person asked me how many stadia is that. It's 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes,"" said Adrian Borsa from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His numbers were released as other scientists stated that the summer's big hurricanes had a clear human influence. Harvey, Irma and Maria ripped through the US Gulf states and the Caribbean, leading to widespread flooding and wind damage. Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here in New Orleans that the heavy rainfall seen in Harvey was very likely exacerbated by the extra warming associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were particularly high in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico this hurricane season. Warm ocean water acts as a fuel for the storms. Media caption The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Harvey devastated parts of the Texas coastline because it stalled, concentrating its deluge in a very narrow region. It was one of the heaviest precipitation events in recorded hurricane history. Standard rain gauges recorded upwards of 1,270mm (50 inches) of precipitation in places. But these were point measurements and Dr Borsa attempted to get a much broader view by measuring how much the Earth moved in response to the weight of overlying water. This was detected by a network of high-precision GPS stations. ""It's like you sitting down on a mattress - it depresses; you stand up and it rebounds. The Earth behaves very similarly, like a rubber block. So the Earth is recording the effects of the loads acting on its surface."" The GPS network is dense enough that a broad picture of activity can be discerned. ""It gives us a holistic view, not just point measurements,” Dr Borsa told BBC News. What is smart is that the system can see the immediate change as water runs off the land through rivers, but also captures the much slower effect of water removal through evaporation, driven by the warmth of the Sun. This takes several weeks. ""One of the big deficiencies in our models is that evapotranspiration - that's the Sun and plants doing their things - is not currently directly observed, and it's half of the total water budget. I think this GPS is going to be able to provide very useful information about this."" At the same annual scientific gathering, the American Meteorological Association revealed that its annual report on extreme weather events had identified three that would “not have been not possible” without the influence of human-induced climate change. These were: the record-breaking global temperatures in 2016; the 2016 heat wave across Asia and the high ocean temperatures measured off the coast of Alaska. These were events that happened because “we have created a new climate,” said National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) climate scientist Stephanie Herring. The report also concluded that other heat waves around the world were made more intense by climate change and that Arctic warming was “most likely” not possible without it. The coral bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef and other marine ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean were also amplified by “human-caused warming of the ocean”. The research is primarily based on comparing models, or simulations, of our climate. “We run a model that shows what the world looks like today and we can validate those models against what is actually happening,” explained Dr Herring. “Then we compare it to a model of an ‘alternative world’ in which - theoretically - climate change never happened. As if humans didn’t emit greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. “So we can look at a world with climate change and a world without it.”",Scientists established how much rain fell by measuring how much the Earth compressed during the storm.,2017-12-14T00:57:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hurricane Harvey rainfall 'weighed 127bn tonnes',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42347510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05dh54p.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Hurricane Maria,1
Adam Rogers,"The sixth-month anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s grinding-up of Puerto Rico brought what might feel like good news. According to AEE, the Electrical Energy Authority, almost 93 percent of Puerto Ricans—1,365,065 people—now have power. The process has been agonizing—a misguided early repair contract to the unlikely Whitefish Energy for $300 million got cancelled, and it took months for crews from better-suited firms to get started. Financial problems, logistical difficulties, and a weird reluctance on the part of the federal government to make Puerto Rico a priority all extended the timeline. The work is far from over. Thousands of people are still without water and power, and suffering—especially in rural areas—goes on. But in the midst of that tumult and travail, some technologists see opportunities for innovation. Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure was falling apart even before the hurricane. So lots of folks are advocating solar power systems as a jump into the future. Earlier this month, the design-driven nonprofit Resilient Power Puerto Rico announced it would receive grants of $625,000, with which the group plans to construct 25 of a planned 100 small, commercial-scale solar arrays—with an eye toward revamping pieces of the island’s grid. Jonathan Marvel Resilient Power Puerto Rico is itself powered, in part, by Jonathan Marvel, an architect perhaps best known these days for beautiful hipster remodels in Brooklyn. But Marvel’s father Thomas was one of the islands most important architects. “I was without a lot of knowledge about solar or electrical engineering, but because of the hurricane, and being born and raised here—I have an office in San Juan as well as new York—it became a matter of pride and responsibility to try to power up Puerto Rico,” Marvel says. His pedigree goes back even farther; Marvel’s great uncle was famed designer Buckminster Fuller, of geodesic domes, Dymaxion cars, and the early sustainability philosophy of Spaceship Earth. “We started by bringing solar generators and batteries, because the governor said we could install them without having to go through a permitting process during the relief and recovery period,” Marvel says. Instead of homes, Marvel installed solar panels at the community centers common in smaller municipalities, where people already gathered and could share the power. “If we could power up community centers, we could power up the island.” Resilient Power Puerto Rico isn’t the only group working on solar. (Naomi Klein has a terrific article in The Intercept about this movement.) It has installed six community center arrays so far—20 panels each, with two Tesla batteries (one for backup), each capable of supplying 5 to 6 kWh. It’s not enough to run an air conditioner all day, but it’ll run water filters, pumps, and charging stations for phones and radios. “The beauty of the Powerwall, which is what we’re installing, is that it’s super-efficient. It occupies very little space, hangs on existing block wall so that there’s more space left for activities,” Marvel says. That’s not a replacement for a traditional power grid, of course. AEE says repair crews have brought in 6,647 new transformers, 45,200 poles (with thousands more on the way), and 19,000 miles of cable to get power from generation facilities—running on coal or oil—to users. The last mile is always the hardest; Puerto Rico’s power utility Prepa had serious financial woes even before Maria, which slowed things down, and the hurricane did some of its heaviest damage in remote areas where transmission lines carried power from generating facilities to population centers. A December report from Prepa and the New York Governor’s Office, among others, said that $17.6 billion over the next ten years could completely revamp Puerto Rico’s aged grid. The model might be what New York did on Long Island after Hurricane Sandy, hardening infrastructure against storms with flood barriers and elevated platforms while upgrading traditional transmission and distribution lines. But the report also recommends switching 10 percent of the system to “microgrids,” solar panels with battery storage that could provide backup power to critical infrastructure like hospitals, as well as rural areas. Solar can’t replace an island-wide grid; it’s not efficient enough yet, even in a place that gets as much sun as Puerto Rico. Solar-plus-batteries helps, because the sun can literally charge the batteries for a rainy day—or for nightfall. Batteries smooth out peaks and valleys in output. “To be clear, it’s still cheaper to serve most of the population with grid electricity, but for facilities where resilience is super-important, like a fire station or a wastewater treatment facility, it makes sense to price in the added cost,” says Varun Sivaram, a science and technology fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of Taming the Sun. “Microgrids are complex systems, but they’ve been built in many places and lots of people have expertise in building them. The primary hurdles are policy and standards.” Marvel knows that, but he wants to expand the microgrid idea even further—beyond individual buildings to entire municipalities. He was in Puerto Rico a couple weeks ago talking to mayors, hoping to move from the scale of a single building to powering 20,000 people. “As long as we’re not crossing property lines, we can legally create these microgrids,” Marvel says. “Right now it’s all in the engineering and proposal stages. We’re looking for locations to host and opportunities to finance the locations. Because of the interest from the mayors, I don’t think there’s going to be a shortage of places.” This is the kind of project that fewer people know how to build, but that might have a far greater impact. It’s also, perhaps not by coincidence, the kind of systems-based, sustainable, futuristic Spaceship Earth-type solution that Marvel’s Great Uncle Bucky would probably have approved of. (Putting a geodesic dome over Puerto Rico seems less feasible.) And if his group can get that stepped-up scale of solar built, it could have a ripple effect—not just in Puerto Rico, but everywhere. “Architects love to talk about scale—the scale of a house, a city, a planet,” Marvel says. “If you can solve things in Puerto Rico, you can solve things on a larger scale as well.” There’s already evidence of demand. Microsoft, for example, is buying 315 megawatts of solar for its cloud computing facilities in Virginia. “Solar deployed at the scale of communities is a kind goldilocks zone,” Sivaram says. Rooftop solar isn’t always economical, and vast solar installations require new substations and transmission lines, but “solar at a megawatt scale, on the order of serving hundreds of American households, that’s the right scale. But for that to happen it’s got to be integrated into the rest of the electricity grid.” For now, though, it makes sense to focus on Puerto Rico recovery. The island has at least a few of the resources necessary for a project like this—plenty of fresh water, plenty of sunlight, plenty of labor. What it lacks, of course, is capital. Resilience Power Puerto Rico figures it’ll take $5 million to $10 million to power up a 20,000-person solar grid. So now Marvel finds himself in a policy role, talking to mayors and potential sources of funding, negotiating property rights. He says he’s just using standard architectural problem solving to help out his childhood home. “Architecture is a profession that sees things holistically, that sees things along the lines of systems dynamics, where everything is interrelated,” he says. “Those are tools we learn in architecture school.” And even though the efforts to get the power back on with traditional technology seem to finally be seeing success, the clock is ticking. The 2018 hurricane season starts in June. Powering Up Overhauling Puerto Rico’s grid won’t be easy, but it’s necessary. One reason an island territory needs power? To communicate with itself, and the rest of the world. Hurricane Maria was a disaster with many faces, including a health crisis with dimensions still largely unknown.","Architect Jonathan Marvel is building solar arrays to serve community centers, and soon, he hopes, communities.",2018-03-26T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",This Brooklyn Architect Wants to Rewire Puerto Rico with Solar,https://www.wired.com/story/this-brooklyn-architect-wants-to-rewire-puerto-rico-with-solar/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ab593c3a54678516963cc8e/191:100/pass/puertoricosolarpanels.jpg,wired,Wired,Hurricane Maria,1

I'm sure the floats and some of those marching will have the T-shirts too.""

(Photo: Monsy Alvarado/NorthJersey.com) Magalye Matos of Englewood said she hasn't gone to the parade in the last few years, but on Sunday she was there with her daughter, London, 3, and son, Christopher 13. The three sported red, white and blue clothing. ""We are going to make a stand, and we are going to march in our parade and we are going to see us all together and marching in solidarity for Puerto Rico,'' she said. ""I love the black and the mourning, but I feel that I’m going to honor my flag originally the way it was made and I’m going to wear it loud and proud."" A sea of flags could be seen along the parade route on Fifth Avenue, with many people also wearing the colors of the flag. Spectators draped the flag over their shoulders as they waved to marchers. The crowds cheered and danced as floats made their way up north, past Central Park and residential buildings at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue. Some spectators brought typical Puerto Rican food, including rice and pigeon peas, to eat while they watched the parade. Still, the mood of protest was unmissable. One float carried a small sign that read, ""Stop lying, we are dying."" Geraldo Barcene Jr., 56, said the federal government continues to not do enough to help Puerto Rico. ""The people on the island can't do it themselves,'' he said. ""They know Puerto Rico needs help. They have helped Florida when they needed help, and that help should be given to Puerto Rico and they need it more."" People also questioned the government's official death toll of 64. The storm led to power outages and a disruption in medical services across the island, and many homes were left for weeks without water, electricity or cell phone coverage. Researchers in the Harvard study, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, said 4,645 lost their lives after the Sept. 20 storm. Richie Roman of New York City said he was on the island during the storm, and his son, who is still there, said families were forced to bury their dead on their own property because they couldn't access funeral homes. ""I was there. There was a lot more people there that were lost,'' Roman said. Puerto Rican officials have said that a separate study by George Washington University into the fatalities of Hurricane Maria is forthcoming. Among those marching in the parade were Puerto Ricans who have relocated to the mainland because they were displaced from their homes. The parade also honored those who helped with the emergency response soon after the storm, and those who have continued to lend a hand during ongoing recovery efforts. David Begnaud, a CBS News reporter, was among the honorees, chosen for his coverage of the hurricane and its aftermath. The parade typical draws more than a million spectators, and is one of New York City's largest.

FRANCES ROBLES,"“FEMA is going to be here, very much for the long term and the rebuilding,” General Buchanan said. “We in the military generally don’t do that.” Shortly afterward, the government announced that Abner Gómez, the commissioner of the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, had resigned. It was unclear whether Mr. Gómez’s resignation was an indication that the government had recognized a failure in its response to Hurricane Maria, or that he had simply lost influence at the agency. Mr. Gómez’s profile had diminished this year when the governor created a cabinet position over him. He had not been a visible figure since the storm and rarely appeared at news conferences. In his resignation letter, Mr. Gómez acknowledged that the recovery had largely been assigned to someone else, so he was stepping down to let his new supervisor, the secretary of public safety, name his own team. Mr. Gómez did not respond to requests for comment. On Thursday, Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló asked his cabinet to sign undated letters of resignation. Mr. Rosselló has vowed to eliminate 100 agencies and many members of the cabinet are going to find themselves without jobs, he said. “We had an emergency phase where practically all of us were sustaining lives,” he said. “We are now entering a recovery phase,” and for that, he said, he needs a more nimble government. Oscar Ramiro, the head chef of a popular bakery in San Juan, said that Mr. Gómez was not the only official who had shown himself unable to address the destruction of Hurricane Maria. Others should also resign or be replaced, starting at the top, said Mr. Ramiro, who still has no power at his house in Rio Piedras, a San Juan neighborhood. “He’s been pretty incompetent,” he said of Mr. Gómez. “The governor entrusted him with this responsibility, which means that ultimately, the problem is the governor.” Caitlin Dickerson contributed reporting from San Juan.

Nick Brown,"ADJUNTAS, PUERTO RICO (Reuters) - At 84 years old and battling cancer, Israel Gonzalez Maldonado has lived without electricity for the nine months since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico. His wife, Zoraida Reyes, 77, struggles to keep the house stocked with fresh food without a refrigerator. At night, she fans her husband so he can sleep. With another hurricane season starting, older Puerto Ricans have little to protect them from another storm on an impoverished island that remains far from fully recovered. Younger and wealthier people have been moving away for years, leaving an older and sicker population in the hands of an underfunded healthcare system. Tens of thousands more have fled since Maria. “We wish we could move, at least for the time he has left,” Reyes said of her husband. Senior citizens make up a larger share of the population here than in all but four U.S. states, according to federal Census data. About half are disabled, more than any state. Forty percent of seniors rely on food stamps, more than three times the percentage in New York state, the second-highest nationally. (For a graphic on Puerto Rico's aging population, see: tmsnrt.rs/2L9N6M0 ) Yet the island has just six nursing homes - with a total of 159 beds - that are certified by the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid (CMS) to provide rehabilitative services. Puerto Rico relies instead on a patchwork of about 800 nursing homes licensed by the island’s Department of Family. They are typically private businesses or nonprofit organizations that care for small numbers of elderly people with limited services - and limited budgets, strained further since Maria. A fragile healthcare system is hardly the only problem that leaves the elderly here - and all Puerto Ricans - vulnerable to another catastrophic storm. About 7,000 houses and businesses still lack power, after Maria leveled a grid that was ill-maintained before the storm. Power utility PREPA has patched together most of the system but remains years away from making the fundamental improvements needed to enable it to withstand another hurricane. “The grid needs to be rebuilt - not just the lines,” PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins said. Maria also damaged nearly half the island’s levees. Several major water pumps, used to remove floodwater, remain in disrepair. “God help us, but we definitely can’t handle any more hurricanes,” said Tania Vazquez, the island’s secretary of natural resources. Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office declined to comment on the island’s hurricane preparedness or on specific efforts to protect the elderly, referring questions to other agencies. Glorimar Andujar, Secretary of the Department of Family, said officials learned a lot from Maria about how to prepare for the next storm. “The emergency plans are much better,” Andujar said, “because we now have an experience that no other generation of agency leaders have experienced.” ELDERLY AT RISK Rosa Iturrizaga runs Hostal de Amigos, a small eldercare residence in San Juan. The home barely broke even before Maria, relying on resident fees of between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. Since then, two of 11 residents moved to the mainland, and insurance has so far not paid for about $40,000 in storm damage, Iturrizaga said. The business carries $500,000 in debt, has fallen behind on loan and tax payments and now loses up to $5,000 a month. “I don’t know what’s kept me going,” Iturrizaga said. “I love doing this, but I’m looking at other things to do with the land.” Another private home, the nonprofit Asilo San Rafael in Arecibo, theoretically charges residents $1,200 a month; in reality, only three of 27 residents pay full price, and at least nine pay nothing, said board member Lucila Oliver. Operating costs run about $700,000 annually, with about $110,000 coming from a handful of subsidies from the island’s central government – subsidies she says have declined sharply in recent years as the now-bankrupt Puerto Rican government fell into a fiscal crisis, Oliver said. The Department of Family’s Andujar disputed that the subsidies have declined, but Oliver provided Reuters with balance sheets showing a drop in department funding to $59,000 this fiscal year from $80,000 last year. Maria brought new costs: about $1,200 a month to bring in water tanks, and thousands more on diesel for generators. Oliver said San Rafael is “used to living on the edge,” but says the edge has drawn closer since the hurricanes. Many elderly and disabled here find a way to get by at home, with little care. Some seek help from the Department of Family, applying for a caregiver to come by just a day or two a week, said Andujar. Many are turned away, she said. “The funding is very limited,” she said, “and the need is very big.” PREPARING FOR ANOTHER HIT This hurricane season, the department is making sure it has accurate locations for all licensed nursing homes after cell phone service disruptions stymied the response to Hurricane Maria. The homes, Andujar said, are now required to have 30 days of food on hand, and the department has also requested they have generators and water tanks. She added that about 315,000 elderly people currently receive benefits as part of a $1.27 billion federal allocation under the Nutritional Assistance Program. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remains on the island and said it has given municipalities money to improve community resilience. Dr. Carmen Sanchez Salgado, Puerto Rico’s ombudsmen for the elderly, said her staff has been educating elderly people about the emergency supplies they need. Charities and nonprofits have also helped. The nonprofit PRxPR, created in response to Maria, is funding solar panels for elderly people and community centers. One such center in Naguabo had no power as recently as four weeks ago, said Carmen Baez, the group’s co-founder. “Our installation was it,” she said.

oliviarosane,"Puerto Rico will revise the official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to nearly 3,000 following the release of a report by the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (GW SPH) commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, CNN reported Tuesday. The study used data from 2010 to 2017 to predict mortality on Puerto Rico if the hurricane had not occurred and compared that figure to actual deaths on the island from September 2017 to February 2018, concluding there were 2,975 excess deaths during that period. That estimate took into account migration away from the island following the September 2017 storm. ""Even though it is an estimate, we are officially changing, or we are putting an official number to the death toll,"" Puerto Rican Gove. Ricardo Rossello told reporters Tuesday, according to CNN. ""We will take the 2,975 number as the official estimate for the excess deaths as a product of Maria."" The new official estimate comes as various studies have suggested that many more people died in the devastating storm than previous government numbers indicated. The new official number is below the around 5,000 deaths estimated by a Harvard study in May and higher than the 1,139 estimated by a research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this month. ""I do think this study helps to validate that sense that many people had that there were just too many deaths,"" GW SPH Dean Lynn Goldman told CNN. She said the research team would conduct another phase of the study to determine which of the excess deaths were in fact caused by the hurricane. The numbers refocus attention on the Trump administration's lackluster response to the storm. ""These numbers are only the latest to underscore that the federal response to the hurricanes was disastrously inadequate and, as a result, thousands of our fellow American citizens lost their lives,"" New York Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez said in a statement reported by The Guardian. The study also adds more evidence against President Donald Trump's claim, when he visited Puerto Rico shortly after the hurricane, that the death toll was low. ""If you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died... 16 people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people,"" he said at the time, according to ABC News. In fact, the official Maria death toll now stands above the Hurricane Katrina death toll of more than 1,800, as estimated by the National Hurricane Center. The researchers covered a six-month period because so many homes were without power for an incredibly long time. The Guardian reported. Lack of power increased exposure to extreme heat without fans or air conditioning and forced people to make more physical effort. ""It's fairly striking that you have so many households without electricity for so long. That's unusual in the US after a disaster,"" Goldman said. The report found that the death rate was higher for all age groups and social spheres during the period studied, but that people living in towns with lower socioeconomic development had a risk of death 45 percent higher. Older men were also more likely to experience higher mortality rates. The Puerto Rican government also commissioned GW SPH to assess how well it implemented the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for reporting mortality in disasters and how well it communicated crisis and mortality information. The report concluded that the Puerto Rican government's lack of communication about best practices for death certificate reporting before the 2017 hurricane season, as well as a lack of awareness among doctors about how to report deaths after disasters, decreased the number of deaths attributed to the hurricane on official certificates. GW SPH also conducted interviews with Puerto Rican government staffers, and found that the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the Central Communications Office in the Governor's Office did not have written communication plans for emergencies. Interviewees also told researchers that there were not enough communications staff before the hurricane started and that an increase in staff after the hurricane was inefficiently managed. Further, there were also no plans in place to use alternative communication channels once power cut out following the storm. Researcher Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in a statement reported by ABC News that the report could provide a template for improvements. ""We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island's resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters,"" he said. Rosello made promises to that effect, announcing the creation of a ""9/20"" commission for determining how Puerto Rico could improve its disaster response, The Guardian reported.","EcoWatch Official Hurricane Maria Death Toll Raised to Nearly 3000 EcoWatch Puerto Rico will revise the official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to nearly 3,000 following the release of a report by the George Washington University Milken Institute School o…",2018-08-29T20:48:41Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ecowatch.com'}",Official Hurricane Maria Death Toll Raised to Nearly 3000 - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/official-hurricane-maria-death-toll-raised-2599913746.html,https://ecowatchroar-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F18392124%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/a7SFgMTRrWviFzqn/img.jpg,,Ecowatch.com,Hurricane Maria,1
Andy Isaacson,"March 29, 2018 23 min read This story appears in the April 2018 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » When Hurricane Maria raked across Puerto Rico last September with wind speeds of up to 155 miles per hour, it left a path of unprecedented destruction. The storm flattened houses and forests, flooded towns and made hundreds of thousands of people homeless. It knocked out most of the island’s power grid, leaving nearly all 3.7 million residents in the dark, and severed 95 percent of cell networks as well as 85 percent of aboveground phone and internet cables. Eighty percent of the island’s crops were decimated. Related: Is Your Business Ready for the Next Devastating Natural Disaster? Once the hurricane moved on, an all-too-common aftermath unfolded. Local emergency responders became overwhelmed. There was, memorably, public fighting among political officials -- San Juan’s mayor versus President Trump. Relief agencies and volunteers flooded in. People who wanted to help could find long lists of organizations to donate to, though, as is typical after a disaster, it wasn’t clear where the money was best spent. Dollars often flowed indiscriminately. Ten days after the hurricane, a different kind of responder arrived on the island. His name was Jesse Levin, a 32-year-old serial entrepreneur with close-cropped hair and aviators, and the co-founder of a series of rock-climbing gyms called Brooklyn Boulders. He had no military background, though he had volunteered in past disaster zones and spoke the language of relief -- casually discussing “air assets” and “force multipliers.” Before he arrived he’d made plans to help, help that didn’t necessarily involve the cluster of government agencies and NGOs that were scrambling to advance their operations. “It was mind-boggling,” he recalls now. “There was just completely ineffective communication going on.” A rented jeep was waiting for him. Once in Puerto Rico, Levin spent several days crisscrossing the island’s debris-strewn roads, talking to residents, business owners, mayors and policemen. He rarely came across an aid worker or a utility truck. In the media, he’d kept hearing that people were desperate for food and water. But in village after village, Levin encountered grocery stores open and stocked with enough provisions to sustain the local communities. Enterprising merchants had even rustled up generators to keep on the lights. But many customers couldn’t buy anything: Around 40 percent of Puerto Rico’s population depends on food stamps, which require Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards to make purchases. With the island’s telecommunications network down, the cards couldn’t be processed. This particular problem didn’t require an intensive governmental effort to distribute food and water. It was just a connectivity issue that nobody else was solving. So Levin coordinated with Steve Birnbaum, a satellite communications expert he works with, who had arrived on the island a week before the hurricane to prep for the storm’s aftermath. Their plan: to personally buy a bunch of small satellite terminals from Focused Mission, an emergency response business on the island. Levin then worked some local government contacts until he wrangled a helicopter. Among them was Puerto Rico’s chief information officer, Luis Arocho, who came along for a beta test to see if their plan would succeed. Soon this small team was airborne and installing terminals on two grocery store rooftops. They flipped the switches and boom -- EBT purchases now worked. Levin would go on to install 12 more. The experience was validating. “If the economy is broken in a place, the location can’t heal,” Levin says. But now, functioning EBT machines can lead to more products sold, more employees paid and more shelves restocked -- an economic system revived, and saved from further dependence on FEMA aid. He says the hard costs totaled $33,000, which was ultimately reimbursed by the Foundation for Puerto Rico, and that around $3 million in transactions have since passed through the satellite terminals. But it was legitimizing on a far larger level as well. Levin isn’t here in Puerto Rico simply to do one-off projects like this. He’s here to advance a concept -- an audacious idea that he calls “expeditionary entrepreneurship.” In essence, it’s disaster relief in the form of entrepreneurship. Governments and NGOs are important, he says, with their standard operating procedures and approaches to administering aid. But entrepreneurship -- not profiteering, but the principles of entrepreneurship -- can accomplish what those bodies cannot: quick and nimble responses to ground-level problems, and connective tissue between foreign aid resources and capable local actors like grocery store merchants who are often not engaged. The same instincts that help an entrepreneur build a business, in other words, can help them rebuild a region from catastrophe. Levin explains this to me as we drive past toppled power lines and landslide debris in Puerto Rico’s lush interior mountains. It is mid-January, four months after the storm has passed. “An entrepreneur looks at systems and comes up with creative fixes,” he says. “We start from the bottom up.” Image Credit: Andy Isaacson Levin didn’t just dream up “expeditionary entrepreneurship” one day. Instead, he came to it after pursuing two parallel paths: He was an adventurer, and an entrepreneur. Related: 5 Ways to Prepare Your Business for Natural Disasters, Catastrophes and Income Loss He’s always had an entrepreneur’s sensibility -- that ability to sniff out an opportunity and boldly claim it. As a middle schooler in Connecticut, he launched a guerrilla marketing company called Jesse Levin’s Adrenaline Marketing. (Slogan: “With all due respect, you need a kid.”) He talked the beverage company SoBe into paying him $15,000 and helped promote them at extreme sports events by dyeing his, his friends’ and even his dog’s hair the brand’s hue of green. During summers, meanwhile, he also attended wilderness survival classes, learning how to build shelters and track animals through the woods. He became captivated by the power of resourcefulness -- how solutions exist all around us. “Survival school informed every facet of my life,” Levin says. “My relationships, how I see things, how I conduct my business.” After graduating from Babson College in 2007, those two passions continued apace. He moved to Panama, got into real estate, eventually bought a farm, and then launched a consulting firm. A Dutch company hired him to do project management and cultural mediation work in a remote coastal area where it had acquired land. The area -- a haven for narcotraffickers and local mafia -- was prone to flooding, and Levin inadvertently became the go-between for the special maritime police and the Red Cross to deliver medical care and supplies to his local community. The experience got him interested in disaster relief, so he followed the typical path: He volunteered. Following the historic earthquake in Haiti in 2010, he joined the NGO Hope for Haiti and spent six months crawling around the rubble. After the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, he split his time between Manila and a town named Tacloban, where he worked alongside Team Rubicon, a relief organization made up of veterans. Amid these overseas excursions, he was also pursuing traditional entrepreneurship. He became co-founder of Brooklyn Boulders, a New York climbing gym that was expanding into new cities. The first location was just outside Boston, and Levin’s goal was to draw people to the space. He realized that the same principles he’d learned in Haiti and the Philippines -- drop in with no agenda, assemble a capable operational team and work closely with locals to find culturally relevant solutions -- could work here as well. “We found the bike builders, the finger painters, the VCs and the nonprofits, and as we built, we said, ‘Here’s our philosophy: How can you leverage this space to amplify what’s going on here locally?’ ” Soon the place became a hybrid gym/community center/co-working space, hosting drone races, TEDx events and nude drawing classes, with MIT engineering students mingling with graffiti artists. Levin would replicate the concept in Chicago, and sell most of his stake in 2016. Throughout this period, starting in 2010, he also launched and ran a company called Tactivate, which pitches itself as a project manager inspired by the strategies and tenets of Special Operations. Through his disaster work, Levin had befriended many Air Force pararescuemen and Army Ranger types. He found them to be inherently entrepreneurial, but their resourcefulness, wide-ranging capabilities and “operational mentality” often went unappreciated in the civilian world. Tactivate could bridge that divide, he reasoned, by combining military veterans with what its website describes as “installation artists, hospitality gurus, bootstrap entrepreneurs, branders” and more, for whatever project needs doing. That’s turned out to include running events, art installations and a “pop-up outdoor survival training bar” in Miami. His parallel life pursuits had begun to bleed together, each informing the other. In entrepreneurship, he was channeling disaster relief -- the idea of moving quickly, identifying needs and bringing people together. In disaster relief, he’d been applying entrepreneurship -- dropping into post-disaster environments and creatively supporting local capacity. Along the way, Levin had assembled a vast Rolodex of relief operatives, from medics, communications specialists and private pilots to people involved in emergency logistics and air freight transport. “We all just kind of team up and see how we can fix things,” he says. “We’re fixers.” By last year, he’d come up with the phrase “expeditionary entrepreneurship” as a way to formalize his approach to disaster relief. Now he wouldn’t just be freelancing his way through regions; he’d be enacting a named strategy, which he could communicate to others. On September 20, this new phrase had its first test case: Hurricane Maria hit. Image Credit: Andy Isaacson “Cómo estás, señor!” Levin says, as he bro-hugs the guard at the security desk. “ Todo bien, caballero,” replies the guard chummily. We’re breezing into La Fortaleza, the bright-blue governor’s palace in San Juan’s colonial quarter, as if Levin didn’t just land in Puerto Rico for the first time three months earlier. We head across the lobby’s marble floor and up the stairs to the corner office of PRITS, or the Puerto Rican Innovation and Technology Services. It’s a newly formed unit headed by two former executives -- Luis Arocho, the island’s chief information officer, and Glorimar Ripoll, its chief innovation officer -- and tasked with introducing data science and technology into Puerto Rico’s bloated bureaucracy. It’s also become something of a home base for Levin, a place receptive to his particular brand of entrepreneurship. As we approach, we find the office in a flurry of redecoration. A black love seat, armchairs and gold side tables form a new reception area by the door. We stand and watch long slab tables crafted from trees felled by Maria -- and a large wooden PRITS sign emblazoned with the Puerto Rican flag -- being hoisted into an open window by a cherry picker. A giant, flashy canvas donated by a famed local artist, painted with the words La Gran Fiesta, is carried in and then promptly taken away: too much. Levin smiles. In his vision, everything is scalable -- every relationship, every idea. You start with one thing and build off it. It’s not always easy to draw a straight line from one to the next, but what’s happening in this office, at least, offers a useful pathway of how Levin’s philosophy unfolds. Related: 5 Steps for Managing Disaster Recovery for Your Business It started with that project to install satellite terminals. Originally, Levin had asked Arocho, the chief information officer, for help. “I thought, This is great, but knowing government, it probably won’t happen as fast as we need it, ” Arocho recalls. It had taken six weeks to request and launch Google’s balloon-powered Project Loon internet service on the island. But when Levin and his team produced the technology in less than a week, Arocho was impressed. “At that moment, I knew these guys were for real,” he says. “They’re forward thinkers. They offer a different approach -- that entrepreneurial mindset -- to dealing with government problems.” Now Levin had a useful new relationship. Arocho became willing to provide, as he calls it, “top cover” for his efforts -- signing forms when necessary, opening doors. And meanwhile, Levin was repeating this process with other key players around Puerto Rico. He’d befriended the heads of the Foundation for Puerto Rico, as well as key officials from FEMA, the military and the Department of Homeland Security. Leveraging his network, Levin often just connected dots. A cutting-edge, solar-powered water-purification system was installed at a Boys &amp; Girls Club in the town of Loíza because of an introduction Levin made between MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory and the Roddenberry Foundation. He introduced Global DIRT, a disaster response team, to a local organization in St. John requiring assistance, leading to a major response and connectivity operation benefiting the U.S. Virgin Islands. “This connection was immensely valuable,” Devin Welch, a solar-power-business owner, told me. Direct relationships and one-off operations can only scale so much, Levin knew. What he needed was to re-create what he had with Brooklyn Boulders -- that gathering point where infinite other relationships could thrive and people could find new ways of helping the island. “Whether in business or disaster response, informal relationships are how everything gets done,” he says. So, not long after arriving in Puerto Rico, Levin took over a six-bedroom house near the beach in San Juan that he found on Airbnb. At $275 per night, it came with a bar and an outdoor pool yet cost the same as a room at the nearby Hyatt. Then he invited everyone he’d met for regular Thursday happy hours (but also almost any time), offering a retreat where exhausted relief workers could decompress over cheese, crackers and bottles of Medalla Light, and even crash in a bedroom if necessary. Here, he believed, the silos of NGOs and government and military could break down. Arocho became a regular. So did senior officials from the U.S. military and FEMA, Puerto Rican bureaucrats and businesspeople and private-­sector technology specialists. Smart, young Puerto Rican doers arrived and began working out collaborations with PRITS. A filmmaker hired by AARP showed up and found people to help her document Maria’s impact on the elderly. Members of relief organizations swapped insights, and found partners for their work ahead. “We were better prepared for what was to come during our time there by hearing real stories of what was occurring and needed,” says Tamara Robertson of Engineers Without Borders. The house created new relationships, but it also continued to strengthen Levin’s existing ones. And that’s how, last January, Levin came to suggest that Arocho redesign the government office. If PRITS is to be an emblem of collaboration and make Puerto Rico attractive to innovators, he argued, the space ought to look the part. Arocho agreed; the office was originally nothing more than a drab, government-issue space. So Levin found a sponsor to put up $15,000, linked in a California-based furniture designer named Marcus Kirkwood and enlisted Levin’s twin sister, Sefra Alexandra, who had also come to Puerto Rico after the hurricane and built seed banks in 26 schools across the island. Now, on this day in January, we’re watching the fruits of collaboration and relationships. The new tables are being arranged. Sefra is decorating the room with tropical plants. Arocho stands by Levin and looks on happily, snapping pictures. Image Credit: Andy Isaacson Much of the attention on Puerto Rico’s hurricane response has focused on government’s colossal failures: FEMA’s sluggish response. The island’s struggle to get a handle on the situation. Corrupt utilities and local mayors. Mismanagement and dysfunction. Wastewater systems and an electrical grid left vulnerable after years of neglect. But there’s another story: how Puerto Rico’s citizens took care of themselves. Neighbors banded together. They shared food, fuel and shelters, driving their own hyperlocal response efforts. Levin talks about Alberto Delacruz, a Coca-Cola distributor he met who mustered 2,000 generators, loaded them on his fleet of trucks and delivered them to stores, clinics, salons and restaurants across the island. “Yes, he wanted his clients back in business,” Levin says. “But he solved a problem.” Necessity also inspired D.I.Y. solutions. I heard about residents powering homespun washing machines with battery-operated drills that they charged with solar panels; about electrifying their homes with car batteries. Local businesspeople began talking of themselves not just as merchants or salespeople but as sources of solutions -- as linchpins of their communities. This is, it turns out, a regular though less reported part of the disaster-recovery cycle. “History has shown that the disruption of existing traditions, policies and structures can create a climate of innovation and entrepreneurship,” reports a 2017 study in the International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior &amp; Research. The research was put together by two DePaul University professors who surveyed decades of reports on how entrepreneurship rises in areas that fall victim to disaster. Their conclusions: Perceptions of entrepreneurship always improve as local people, with their deep knowledge of their community’s needs, become effective in ways that large institutions like government can’t. And local entrepreneurs themselves go through a transformation, shedding anxieties that might have held them back before. “Necessities of the individual and his community override increases in fear of failure,” the DePaul writers report. From this, new solutions are created and new businesses are born. (This phenomenon extends to Levin himself: The co-directors of the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center tell me that, after disasters, independent people often step in to do what he does -- help forge connections. They just don’t typically think of themselves as entrepreneurs.) Related: Volunteer to Help Those in Need – and Become a Better Entrepreneur However, something is happening in Puerto Rico that the DePaul writers hadn’t chronicled elsewhere. Entrepreneurs from outside Puerto Rico are arriving with vigor. Within days of the storm, scores of technology companies in particular have made landfall, ranging from large entities like NetHope and Tesla, which is launching new battery projects on the island, to smaller makers of passive water collection and purification systems and “mobile ad hoc” wi-fi networks. Many see the island as a test bed for their new technologies. Wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have arrived en masse, eyeing Puerto Rico’s generous tax incentives, broken systems and humbled government as an exciting set of challenges. “It’s turned out to be this really amazing opportunity to put to work block-chain technology,” Reeve Collins, cofounder of the company BlockV, told me. Levin watched this happen on the island, and two months after the hurricane, he felt it was time to move on to a new phase of his expeditionary entrepreneurship project -- away from disaster relief, and toward disaster preparedness. (Hurricane season begins in June.) He’d now play superconnector for this new community on the island, locals and newcomers alike, whose products and services could help Puerto Rico in the long run. By this point, Levin had stopped renting his communal Airbnb; the aid workers who frequented the house had largely left. Now he makes connections on the fly. “I go into an area and try to identify who’s who. And I try to empower them and connect them around a goal,” he says. Over the course of my three days with him in January, this is almost entirely what I witness Levin doing. He meets with property developers and investors and lawyers and local foundations and youth activists and surfers and (of course) cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. We stopped in at a tech accelerator one morning to meet re:3D, a startup experimenting with an industrial 3-D printer to fabricate storm-­ravaged stuff like furniture and coral. We had lunch with Milton Soto, an influential bartender who is rehabilitating an elementary school after the hurricane, before stopping by Aqui Se Puede, a watering hole whose owner and resident carpenter once worked for Andy Warhol. For Levin, these encounters are mostly soft touches -- rapport building, part of his overarching effort to piece together a network of “local capacity” in the event of another disaster. One morning, I join Levin for a 7:45 a.m. workout on the beach with Carlos Guardiola, a well-connected Puerto Rican entrepreneur who owns one of the island’s largest warehousing businesses as well as medical cannabis licenses; Rafael Ortiz, who is in private equity; and Ben Manning, a former Navy SEAL fresh out of eight years in the service, whom Levin had taken on as something of an apprentice. (Each night before bed, Levin and Manning “debriefed” about the day’s meetings and exchanged the lessons learned.) After burpees and sprints, we sit down for breakfast at a beachfront inn. Guardiola describes his role as an unofficial connector. “I have a very simple rule: I don’t do business with anybody unless I eat with them seven times,” he tells Levin. “I like to see how you treat the waiter. I like to see who you know around. I like to see how you react. Because everybody’s a great first date.” Since 1996, he’s frequently hosted invite-only salons that bring together venture capitalists, housewives, street artists -- an intentionally diverse mix -- and after the hurricane, that made him a natural contact point for many people on the island. Not unlike Levin, Guardiola began making connections that helped the disaster recovery along. In one case, he connected GivePower, a major clean-energy nonprofit, to local partners to install water desalination and purification systems. “And that’s how real recovery happens,” Levin says. “It’s understanding the landscape, and making very unconventional, strategic relationships of human capital, and understanding the capacity of respective operating groups, and putting them together.” “It basically comes down to what we’re doing here -- it’s breaking bread,” Guardiola replies. “I’m not in the business of employing people, because I think that’s what kills Puerto Rico. That whole mindset of I want to get my sure thing. There is no such thing as a sure thing! And that’s why this is really the perfect storm. You know everybody was thinking, Oh, the United States, they got our back. Bullshit! Oh, we’re going to get money from FEMA. Bullshit!” If Puerto Rico has a savior, they agree, it will be the entrepreneurs on the island -- both the ones born here and the ones flocking in. This is the lesson they took from Hurricane Maria. “Once you realize that no one is here to save you,” Guardiola continues, “that is the most empowering thing, or the most frightening thing. And whoever is frightened should get on a plane and go to Orlando. Get the fuck out of the way.” Image Credit: Andy Isaacson One day, before a meeting with a lawyer from a prominent Puerto Rican real estate family, Levin takes me to the ruins of the former Naval Reserve Officers Beach Club. It’s perched over the sea, above a popular surf spot and in the shadow of an old Spanish fort, but it’s an absolute mess: small buildings stripped down to the concrete and covered in graffiti, hunks of wood scattered like discarded toys. The site belongs to the city of San Juan, but he’s actively courting the city government and pitching investors to turn it over to him. Related: 8 Ways to Use Emotional Intelligence and Make Lasting Connections Here, Levin says, is where he can have a truly lasting impact. “I’m proud of our ability to drop in and be operational, but really, at the end of the day I’m just another guy going out and fixing a radio, or clearing search and rescue,” he says. That’s why he wants this permanent space -- a place to once more repeat what he learned at Brooklyn Boulders. When he’d bring the climbing gym to a new city, Levin would start by inviting a diverse group of locals -- from investors to artists -- into the space as they were building it. He called the gatherings “hard hat dinners,” and the goal was to get influential constituencies in the community to meet each other and have a say in what became of the space. That way, when it opened, they’d already feel like it was theirs. This is what’s missing in Puerto Rico right now, he believes. The worst has passed. Electricity is slowly returning. But what about the next Maria? All of this entrepreneurial energy -- the resurgent locals and the innovators coming with their cutting-edge resiliency technologies -- needs a central place to organize around disaster preparedness and recovery. The way Levin envisions it, this could become an open-air market: a hybrid pop-up space where military veterans teach preparedness skills to patrons amid food trucks, live entertainment and off-grid-technology exhibits. He’d been involved in a project like that in Miami -- minus the disaster element, of course -- and thinks it can work here, too. Recently, Levin signed a one-year lease on an apartment in San Juan. He’s racked up a hefty credit card bill during his time here, but he’s determined to bring his new concept to life and recoup his costs in the process. “Puerto Rico is a phenomenal place to demonstrate this concept of community self-sufficiency,” he says. And if it’s successful, he wants to replicate the idea back in the continental U.S. -- and prepare us all for whatever is to come.","After Hurricane Maria savaged Puerto Rico, a man named Jesse Levin used what he'd learned as an entrepreneur and applied it to disaster relief.

JOHN LELAND,"Making the tapes was his first training for writing Broadway musicals, he said. “It’s the best preparation,” he said. “I’m creating 90 minutes of material for you, I’m shaping the sound. It’s a rollercoaster of fast tempo, slow tempo. I can intercut bits of songs or comedy skits. I’m controlling the flow entirely, and you can’t skip tracks. I’m creating an experience for you of how I feel or how I want you to feel.” Summers he worked for his father, canvassing door-to-door for candidates or writing music for political ads. “Not jingles,” Lin-Manuel said. “But he’d say, ‘I need 30 seconds of Latin jazz for a Sharpton ad,’ or something for Elliot Spitzer,” the short-tenured governor of New York. One of his mixtape friends was Chris Hayes, who is now a host on MSNBC. Mr. Hayes rode the bus to Hunter from the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, and acted in plays with Mr. Miranda. Mr. Miranda rattled off songs from a mixtape Mr. Hayes gave him in ninth grade, all political songs, from Bob Dylan to the hip-hop group Digable Planets. Mr. Hayes said he and Mr. Miranda both saw themselves as less privileged than many of their classmates, and saw the bus ride uptown as a “literal manifestation” of their apartness. Years later, when Mr. Hayes saw a very early workshop of “ Hamilton,” still unfinished, he was struck by the parallels between the title character and the creator, he said. “Seeing Hamilton was an immigrant, he lives uptown, he’s got this outer-borough-striver chip on his shoulder that Lin and I both had — like, I’m going to show these fancy people I belong — it felt so him,” Mr. Hayes said. For Mr. Miranda, Inwood is still home, and subways are still part of his travel diet. Last month he joined a successful campaign to save Coogan’s, the Washington Heights Irish bar that celebrated shamrocks and salsa. “Always happy to rep uptown,” he said. On this morning he was just back from London, where a production of “Hamilton” was starting, without him in the cast, and he was preparing to launch a toy drive for Puerto Rico. He has helped to raise more than $20 million for hurricane relief, and promised to bring “Hamilton” to Puerto Rico in 2019, with himself in the title role. “Since Hurricane Maria, that kind of became my full-time job for a couple months,” he said. Though many relatives have left the island, escaping either the hurricane or the economic collapse that preceded it, others were still there and without power, Luis Miranda said.

CAITLIN DICKERSON,"Puerto Rico was already struggling with an increase in mental illness amid a 10-year recession that brought soaring unemployment, poverty and family separation caused by emigration. Public health officials and caregivers say that Maria has exacerbated the problem. Photo A photo of Ms. Serrano Ortiz with her two oldest children. Her home flooded up to the ceiling during the hurricane. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Many Puerto Ricans are reporting intense feelings of anxiety and depression for the first time in their lives. Some are paranoid that a disaster will strike again. And people who had mental illnesses before the storm, and who have been cut off from therapy and medication, have seen their conditions deteriorate. “When it starts raining, they have episodes of anxiety because they think their house is going to flood again,” said Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz, the clinical psychologist who treated Ms. Serrano Ortiz. “They have heart palpitations, sweating, catastrophic thoughts. They think ‘I’m going to drown,’ ‘I’m going to die,’ ‘I’m going to lose everything.’ ” With hurricane nearly two months in the past, the island is still in shock. Its residents are haunted by dozens of deaths caused by the storm, and many more life-threatening near misses. The reminders are inescapable. They lie in piles of rotting debris as tall as homes that still line many streets and in cellphones that are useless for checking on family members. Returning to a routine is the most important step toward overcoming trauma, according to physicians and public health officials. But for most Puerto Ricans, logistical barriers like scarce water and electricity, as well as closed schools and businesses, make that impossible. Since Sept. 20, when the storm came ashore at 6:15 a.m., more than 2,000 calls have overwhelmed an emergency hotline for psychiatric crises maintained by the Puerto Rican health department — double the normal number for that period of time, even though most residents still do not have working phones. Puerto Rican officials said that suicides had increased — 32 have been reported since the storm — and many more people than normal have been hospitalized after being deemed dangerous to themselves or others. At the emergency health clinic in Toa Baja, where Ms. Serrano Ortiz lives, Dr. Toro said that he had been frantically calling for help from colleagues in other cities because the facility was overrun with people in need of mental health care. Because it is in a flood zone, Toa Baja was one of the worst affected areas in Puerto Rico. At least four people died there and water levels peaked at more than 12 feet. The city of 80,000 west of San Juan flooded multiple times, each time that it rained after Maria passed. Photo Dr. Carlos del Toro Ortiz met with a patient at the emergency clinic in Toa Baja. Mental health experts fear that Puerto Rico is approaching a crisis. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times In his nearly 20 years of practicing medicine, Dr. Toro said he had never before hospitalized as many people with suicidal or homicidal thoughts in such a short time period. Of about 2,500 people who had been to the clinic since it opened two weeks earlier, more than 90 percent were referred for mental health screenings, Dr. Toro said. He and other practitioners at the clinic had already referred at least 20 people to psychiatric wards elsewhere on the island. “This is an emergency situation,” he said. “It’s still affecting us. There are people that we haven’t seen.” Health workers are bracing for effects similar to those seen in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, where cases of both moderate and severe psychiatric illnesses spiked. In New Orleans, many people experienced insomnia, cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss, which became known colloquially and among researchers as “Katrina Brain.” Prolonged losses of electricity, water communications or infrastructure have been linked to the onset of mental health crises, said Dr. Domingo Marqués, the director of clinical psychology at Albizu University, a prominent graduate school of psychology on the island with clinics in two major cities. All of those elements have been relentlessly present in Puerto Rico. “And this is all happening at once,” he said. “What we have lost is the foundation that holds a society together.” He said that Puerto Ricans would have to adjust their definition of normalcy in order to function: “It’s ‘I survived. My family didn’t die.’ That’s the new definition of O.K.” This hurricane season has caused mental distress, and strained resources for treating it, throughout the Caribbean, according to reports from the U n ited States Virgin Islands, Dominica and Antigua. Photo Laura Rodriguez relied on a strict daily routine to manage her borderline personality disorder, a routine upended by Hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times The mental health division of the Puerto Rican health department received $3 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate a response to Maria, said Suzanne Roig, the administrator of the Puerto Rican agency. Its doctors have been knocking on doors in the worst-hit parts of the island and visiting emergency shelters where people who lost their homes have been living. “We are trying to reach people to tell them that this crisis will pass,” she said, “and that they should not make permanent decisions.” The agency also started an initiative to monitor social media, and staged interventions in a handful of homes of people who posted what appeared to be suicide notes. During high-volume hours, its staff members have been taking on extra shifts and working overtime to respond to the increase in phone calls to the 24-hour emergency crisis hotline. In addition to struggling with their own emotions, Ms. Roig said that distressed callers had reported children who had not spoken since the storm or cried inconsolably when it rained. And people with serious mental illnesses who had experienced psychotic episodes had been locked inside rooms by family members who did not know what else to do. “People who have a prescription can’t get to a pharmacy,” Ms. Roig said. “If they can get to the pharmacy it might not be open. If it’s open, they might not have the medicine.” Before the storm, Laura Rodriguez, 39, managed her borderline personality disorder without medication by relying on a strict routine: Early morning CrossFit workouts, long hours at work as an interior designer, going to bed early and never having guests at her home in Río Piedras. But since Maria hit, her gym had been closed and her therapist had not been working. Neither had she. “I’m constantly anxious,” she said. “I get these urges to be violent and I can’t control it.” Memories of the storm were also tormenting her. She had been trapped inside her apartment for two days with her boyfriend, her mother and her mother’s cat. They used plastic tarps, towels, bedsheets and pieces of wood to try to plug the windows where rain water was surging through. Without access to any of the balms that she typically relied on to stabilize her mood, she was worried about resorting to self-harm, an impulse that she had struggled to control since she was 8 years old. “What if it’s like three months, four months?” she said. “I cannot do this for so long.” For Ms. Serrano Ortiz, another threat to her mental and physical health loomed. Before the storm, a scan of her throat had indicated that she may have cancer for the second time. But she has not been able to get any more information about her prognosis because her doctor’s offices have been closed. At the emergency clinic, she told Dr. Toro that she might not have the energy to fight the disease again. When she looked in the mirror, she said, she saw in herself a reflection of her home — something dirty, smelly and tainted. “I don’t feel like myself anymore,” she said.

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet are set to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to assess the U.S. territory’s rebuilding in the three months since Hurricane Maria devastated homes, businesses and the power grid. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will travel to Puerto Rico, where about a third of the island’s 3.4 million residents are still without power, hundreds remain in shelters, and thousands have fled to the U.S. mainland. The visit comes as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday were planning to unveil a disaster aid package totaling $81 billion, according to a senior congressional aide. Some of that aid would go to Puerto Rico, but also to states like Texas and Florida that were hit by other hurricanes and to California, which is grappling with wild fires. Even before Maria savaged Puerto Rico, the island was contending with $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked the federal government for a total of $94.4 billion in aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild its ruined power grid. A woman who lost her home during Hurricane Maria in September rests on a cot at a school turned shelter during a visit of former U.S. President Bill Clinton (not pictured), in Canovanas, Puerto Rico November 20, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has so far approved more than $660 million in aid for individuals in Puerto Rico as well as more than $450 million in public assistance. Nielsen and Carson will receive detailed briefings on rebuilding efforts and see how federal aid is helping residents to recover, a DHS official said. Nielsen, who oversees FEMA, and Rossello are slated to hold a news conference. The visit comes as Congress prepares to vote on a tax overhaul bill that Puerto Rican officials have said they fear will hurt the commonwealth’s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector - the cornerstone of the island’s economy - at a time when Puerto Rico can least afford to lose jobs and tax revenue. Puerto Rico’s government has said 64 people died because of the hurricane, but after multiple media estimates of dramatically higher figures, Rossello on Monday ordered an official review of the death toll.

Rachel Kraus,"If you thought the results for People's Sexiest Man Alive were contentious, buckle your seat belts for the preliminary results of TIME's 'Person of the Year' reader poll, which includes the good, the bad, and the Trump. On Friday, TIME released their annual poll, featuring contestants from The Pope to Ariana Grande. Readers can vote on who is the ""person (or people) who has had the most influence over the news in the last 12 months."" And this year, some surprising contestants have taken the lead. SEE ALSO: Time names Trump person of the year and Twitter has a lot to say As of this writing, the top vote-getters, with 7 percent each, respectively, are the #MeToo campaign (not a person but we're here for it) and Mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulín Cruz, who was an outspoken advocate for Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Also, Taylor Swift. But come on, everyone knows The Swifties rally en force whenever their Queen is up for anything. You can see the preliminary results here. #MeToo, Yulín Cruz, and Swift are all beating out Donald Trump, who has 6 percent of the votes. The Dreamers — those children of immigrants who are protected (for now) under the ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals"" Act — are also tying our dear president for second, with 6 percent of the votes. The #MeToo campaign, which TIME describes as a ""social movement in response to widespread sexual harassment allegations,"" has gone global, opening up conversations about sexual assault in Hollywood, politics, and other industries by encouraging women to share their experiences of sexual harassment or assault. It's a fitting contestant against Donald Trump, a man who remains in power despite the dozen-plus allegations of sexual assault women have levied against him. So too is Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who passionately criticized what she saw as President Trump's inadequate job in helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria damage. President Trump insisted he was doing a ""great job"" and had ""fabulous reviews,"" and criticized Yulín Cruz for poor leadership and playing on divisive politics. Meanwhile, it's been nearly two months since Hurricane Maria struck in late September/early October, and almost half of Puerto Ricans still don't have ready access to electricity or potable water. Trump was TIME 's Person of the Year for 2016. German Chancellor Angela Merkel got the totally meaningful honor in 2015. If you feel passionately about who should receive TIME 's award, you can vote here until the poll closes on December 3. TIME takes reader preference into consideration, but the decision ultimately rests with their editorial board (sorry, Swifties). They'll make their final announcement on December 6. We'll just be over here counting down the hours and holding our breath.","If you thought the results for People's Sexiest Man Alive were contentious, buckle your seat belts for the preliminary results of TIME's 'Person of the Year' reader poll, which includes the good, the bad, and the Trump.

Jeff Cohen,"At the Casa Histórica de la Música Cayeyana — a non-profit house of music in Cayey — people come together on the weekends to sing, dance, and recite poetry. Ryan Caron King/WNPR After the storm blew out her windows, Maria Enid Rodriguez lost water, Internet, power and her entire home office. Her company offered her a one-way ticket to be with family in New Britain, Conn. Rodriguez refused. She said that it was a round trip ticket or nothing. She wanted to come back. ""I went to New Britain for 10 days,"" she said, through her tears. ""Not for me. For them. For my daughters. They have to see me, that I was okay."" She went to Connecticut, saw her family and showed them that she was, in fact, okay. Now, after her return to Puerto Rico, she is at a crossroads. Rodriguez works from home, but she can't work without electricity and Internet. She has two choices, equally distressing: She can stay and lose her job, or she can choose to leave. ""I think that, at the end of December, I have to decide, if the situation in Puerto Rico doesn't get normal,"" Rodriguez said. It's all a lot to think about. Which is why, sometimes, Rodriguez tries not to think about it at all. So, many Friday and Saturday nights she spends her time dancing and socializing at the Casa Historica de la Música Cayeyana. It's a non-profit organization in the heart of Cayey that celebrates the history of the town's music and musicians. Many Puerto Ricans still live without electricity and basic services three months after Hurricane Maria. Some are making time to sing, dance, and celebrate at places like this. The house hosts free concerts for people like Rodriguez to come and, as she said, breathe. The concerts aren't new. They've been happening for about a year, but now they seem to have particularly special resonance. ""Seeing your friend after Maria, it's like seeing them after a long trip,"" Rodriguez said. ""And, in Puerto Rico, everything we celebrate with music. Even funerals."" Andrés Yambó is one of the founders of the music house. He said they had to pack up and then unload everything twice this fall – once for Hurricane Irma, and again for Maria. Then, a week after the hurricane, musicians and friends came together here to sing by candlelight, Yambó said, likening life after Maria to what happens when you lose a family member. ""You carry [the trauma] with you,"" he said. ""But you don't let the loss get in your way of what you have to do in your life."" The free concerts at the Casa Histórica de la Música Cayeyana have had a special resonance after Hurricane Maria, as attendees find respite there on the weekends amid the recovery effort. Ryan Caron King/WNPR Yambó plays an instrument called the cuatro, but his real job is working nights as a radiology technician. The singer who started the night off is an accountant. Didi Melendez is a regular audience member. She spent the night dancing in front of her chair. Maria took the roof off her house, and she said friends in the diaspora — Chicago, Connecticut, New York — helped her rebuild it.

Marisa Peñaloza,"Irma Rivera Aviles and her husband Ivan Martínez stand in front of their home last month. Rivera Aviles was ecstatic about the restoration of power to her neighborhood last Friday. Marisa Penaloza/NPR Irma Rivera Aviles and Ivan Martínez finally got power back in their home in Cataño last Friday afternoon. ""Christmas has arrived!"" Rivera Aviles said ecstatically on Monday. Hurricane María hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, causing Rivera Aviles and Martínez to evacuate to a shelter for more than a week. When they returned to their home in a section of Cataño called El Pueblito, they found it badly damaged as the storm had blown off part of the roof. The hurricane also knocked out power on the entire island, causing Rivera Aviles to feel unsafe in this neighborhood, where she grew up. But on Friday, all that changed. Now, she feels ""safe, secure."" In Cataño, people mark the start of the holiday season on the first Friday of December. This year residents celebrated that as well as the return of power to most of the neighborhood. On Friday evening, residents gathered at the waterfront outside City Hall in Cataño to cheer and sing holiday songs. ""I felt this intense happiness,"" Rivera Aviles said, her voice trembling. ""I can't find the words to describe it."" For her, seeing the lights back on at Nuestra Señora Del Carmen Church was the best Christmas gift ever. There are a few neighborhoods in Cataño, including Vietnam and Puntillas, that are still without power and the priest offered those still in need to come in to the church and charge their cellphones or iron their clothes, Rivera Aviles said. Luckily, their home appliances are working and for the first time in more than two months the couple watched the news on TV at home. They went grocery shopping and cooked breakfast in their kitchen on Saturday morning — scrambled eggs with ham and pancakes. ""I felt alive again,"" she said. But the most important thing, said Rivera Aviles? No need to look for ice to chill Martínez's insulin. They can make the ice they need in their freezer. And though power's restored Rivera Aviles and Martínez still need to fix the roof of their home before they can move back in. ""Life is coming back,"" she said, ""but it will never be the same.""","Irma Rivera Aviles and Ivan Martínez evacuated to a shelter during Hurricane Maria.

Rayne Ellis,"The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences. Hurricanes Irma and Maria — some of the most destructive in Caribbean history — may have forced rapid evolutionary change in a native population of small-bodied anole lizards (Anolis scriptus), researchers in the West Indies say. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down. Here's why that's very bad news for everyone. According to a new study about the lizards released in Nature this week, much of the surviving population of lizards after the hurricanes have larger toe pads, longer forelimbs, and shorter hind limbs than the average anole. Still of lizard clinging to an experimental perch in hurricane-force winds. Wind speed meter is displaying in miles per hour.Credit: Colin Donihue Image: Colin donihue Those long forelimbs and toe pads would have allowed these anoles to cling to surfaces during gale-force winds brought by the hurricanes. Effectively, this means that the hurricanes forced natural selection in real-time, the scientists suggest. “Day in and day out, natural selection favors those lizards who can run around branches, find food, and find mates,” lead author of the study Colin Donihue said in an interview. “It’s only in these atypical instances like hurricanes that we would be able to see a shift away from historical selection.” With the frequency and intensity of hurricanes ramping up, species within affected ecosystems are being forced to adapt to extreme conditions. It's even possible that certain adaptations might aid survival chances in one instance, and hurt them in another, Martha Muñoz, an evolutionary biologist not affiliated with the study, said. ""One trait can enable survivorship in a storm, like shorter hind limbs, but on a daily basis longer hind limbs will help these animals escape predation because it helps them run faster,"" Muñoz said. But it would take an entirely different study to determine how this selection affects the future of the species, and findings like this are rare. In fact, the data from Donihue and colleagues was due to a coincidence. They had just completed a survey of the lizard population immediately before the hurricanes swept through the island. After the hurricanes, they recognized that they had a unique opportunity, and decided to return. The hurricanes key to their research, Irma and Maria, have gone down as two of the worst natural disasters to affect the Caribbean — where it's possible that almost 5,000 people have lost their lives. And a year later, some places affected, like Puerto Rico and Dominica, still don't have power. The literature on the impact of extreme weather events on localized animal populations is a relatively scarce, but burgeoning field due to increased extreme weather. A study published in 2017 found that a polar vortex that hit the Southeast in 2014 drove selection in a population of green anole lizard. The NOAA's GOES-East satellite captured the 2014 polar vortex hovering over the United State's southeast. Image: NASA The researchers behind that study were able to survey the population of lizards before and after the weather event, and found that the surviving population of lizards had many of the genetic qualities in northern populations of the same species. For example, the surviving lizards had an abnormally high tolerance for cold weather in that region. Aside from these two studies, there isn’t much known about how fast-acting extreme weather events change animal populations on a large scale. But with extreme weather events becoming more and more common as human-caused climate change continues, it’s likely that the common agents of natural selection will shift toward those which influence survival during these catastrophes. “The key to this study is understanding that natural selection is on-going and is constantly in the background,” Donihue said The next step? Muñoz suggests going back to the island a year later and measuring the new generation of lizards to see if this natural selection has truly translated into evolution.",The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences.

JACEY FORTIN,"Hurricanes in Categories 3, 4 and 5 are considered “major.” Hurricane Maria was a Category 4 storm when it hit Puerto Rico last year, ultimately killing thousands and causing months of power failures. If a hurricane’s winds reach Category 5 speeds, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed,” according to the National Hurricane Center, and “power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.” Only a few hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States as a Category 5 storm. The last was Andrew, in 1992. Meteorologists caution that a hurricane can be very dangerous no matter what its category, especially since the Saffir-Simpson scale doesn’t tell the whole story. It does not, for example, account for rainfall levels or storm surges — not directly, anyway — and those factors have a lot to do with flood risk. Take Hurricane Sandy. In 2012, it never made landfall as anything stronger than a Category 2 storm. But it led to flooding, mudslides, power failures and dozens of fatalities in the Caribbean and the United States. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm last year and was soon downgraded to a Category 3. That rating did not account for the days of heavy rain that would follow, which led to fatal, catastrophic flooding.","On the morning of a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina, clouds dotted the skies over Nags Head on Tuesday.",2018-09-11T22:12:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",What Is a Category 5 Hurricane?

Sarah Wells,"Google X projects Loon and Wing have left the nest and graduated to independent companies under Google’s parent company Alphabet, Google X Captain of Moonshots, X Astro Teller wrote in a Medium post yesterday. “Today, unlike when they started as X projects, Loon and Wing seem a long way from crazy — and thanks to their years of hard work and relentless testing in the real world, they’re now graduating from X to become two new independent businesses within Alphabet: Loon and wing,” Teller wrote in the post. Loon and Wing, which respectively launched in 2013 and 2014, have both seen substantial progress from the moonshot ideas they were proposed as. Loon, a fleet of internet enabling balloons that patrol the skies to connect remote and technologically undeserved areas, played a role in connecting those affected by flooding in Peru last summer and assisted those devastated by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico this past fall. Meanwhile, Wing, an autonomous drone delivery service aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, has tested its drones remote reach through burrito deliveries in Australia. This May, the U.S. Department of Transportation selected Wing as one of ten teams to push the limits of drone technology in the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program. In his statement, Teller announced that Alastair Westgarth will be stepping in as Loon’s new CEO and Wing will welcome James Ryan Burgess as its new CEO along with Adam Woodworth as CTO. Loon and Wing will now join the ranks of X’s four fellow graduates, including the self-driving car company Waymo and the cybersecurity analytics platform Chronicle, as well as competitors like SpaceX’s prototyped system of internet satellites and Amazon’s long discussed drone delivery system. The skies ahead are far from clear, but with the backing of Alphabet these bright-eyed new companies have a solid start.","Google X projects Loon and Wing have left the nest and graduated to independent companies under Google’s parent company Alphabet, Google X Captain of Moonshots, X Astro Teller wrote in a Medium post yesterday. “Today, unlike when they started as X projects, L…",2018-07-12T16:09:24Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Project Loon and Project Wing graduate from Google X,http://techcrunch.com/2018/07/12/project-loon-and-project-wing-graduate-from-google-x/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wing-page-hero-e1531411712198.jpg?w=532,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Hurricane Maria,1
Martín Echenique,"The remnants of a destroyed home stand more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit the island on October 6th, 2017, in Morovis, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images) When Hurricane Maria came for Carlos Rodríguez, he locked himself, his wife, and his two children in a small bathroom in his house in Gobernador Piñero, southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The wind whistled through the cracks of the door and threatened to blast through the window; on the other side of his street, the roof of his neighbors' home was torn off. ""Maria has been the strongest storm I've ever experienced,"" Rodríguez says. ""It just wiped out everything."" The immediate aftermath was even worse. The power was out, water was scarce, supermarkets closed or empty. Their food rotted in the freezer. For the next six weeks, Rodríguez and his family ate sausages, spaghetti, or crackers only once a day. Lines of hundreds of people waited eight hours to get gasoline. Amid the devastation and chaos, some residents started to go crazy. ""We wanted to leave when we saw that they were assaulting our neighbors,"" he says. ""I could not stay in a situation where there was no power, there was no water, there was no gasoline, there was no work. There was nothing."" Rodriguez sold his guagua— his old car he had bought a few years ago—for $2,000 and contacted his son, Luis, one of the children from his first marriage; Luis has been living in in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the past four years. And on Thanksgiving Day, he and his family headed to Luis Muñoz Marín airport, east of old San Juan, and boarded a flight for Baltimore, Maryland. ""We are starting from scratch,"" Rodriguez told his wife. The Lancaster Connection Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is a small city of 60,000 in southeastern Pennsylvania. It may not seem like the first place that comes to mind when considering where Puerto Ricans might resettle. But Lancaster has been welcoming immigrants for centuries: Most famously, the Amish community that lives in the nearby farms of Lancaster County began settling here in the 1720s, after escaping religious persecution in Europe. Most Maria refugees have migrated to Florida: An estimated 200,000 former residents of the island chose to move to the metropolitan areas of Miami and Orlando. Many others have gone to New York City and New Jersey. But Pennsylvania, which has the fourth-largest population of Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States, has also received thousands of families. They've come not only to Philadelphia, where 8 percent of the city's population is Puerto Rican, according to the 2010 Census, but to smaller towns—Lebanon, Allentown, Reading, and Lancaster. Almost 30 percent of Lancaster's residents are Puerto Rican or boricua (Americans of Puerto Rican descent), according to data from the 2016 American Community Survey. Lancaster's new mayor, Danene Sorace, wasn't surprised to learn that evacuees were heading to town. ""I knew immediately that we were going to be welcoming family members into the city, for sure,"" Sorace says. But resettling these new residents has been a challenge, as the city has limited economic and institutional resources. Unlike major cities with deep ties to the Puerto Rican community, like New York City or Orlando, Lancaster is struggling with how to deliver assistance in a coordinated manner and link non-governmental organizations and social services with the evacuees. ""It's been crazy,"" says Yirmares Cuevas, director of Lancaster's Spanish American Civic Association, which has been helping to support the new arrivals. ""I've never seen anything like this before in my 16 years at SACA."" Puerto Ricans have been in Lancaster for decades: During the 1960s, the first wave of transplants began to arrive in this part of Pennsylvania, driven by rising housing costs in New York and New Jersey and the promise of industrial jobs. As the Puerto Rican debt crisis deepened in recent years, that migration accelerated. Today, almost 40 percent of the city's population is Hispanic, and most are Puerto Rican, a proportion second only to Reading. The region has several attractions for newcomers. Lancaster is one of a relatively modest number of small Rust Belt cities to enjoy economic growth in recent years, thanks in part to its healthy tourist sector and proximity to Philadelphia and Baltimore. Cafes, restaurants, art galleries, and vinyl record stores abound along Prince Street, one of the historic main drags in the city. Hidden inside a building in the center of the city, across the street from the country's oldest farmer's market, is Old San Juan, a new Puerto Rican restaurant. It's one of a handful of visible signs of the thriving boricua community hidden away here. The shape of the Maria migration is driven largely by personal networks, perceived job opportunities, and especially family ties. Lancaster's existing Puerto Rican community has been a key draw, says Edwin Meléndez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at the City University of New York. ""Friends, relatives, or acquaintances are those who transmit the information to those who want to leave the island,"" he says. ""Many times [relatives] are the ones in charge of receiving newcomers and help them in those first weeks in the new place."" It's not clear exactly how many Puerto Ricans have moved to Lancaster since the hurricane. But data from the county's school district offers a clue: To date, the district has received 108 families and 187 Puerto Rican students since Maria destroyed the island. ""In all, there would be between 400 and 500 people,"" says Lisette Rivera, coordinator of Families for Transition, a 30-year-old program of the Lancaster school district that has been the focal point for immigrant families who enroll their children in school. The number of families arriving at their office has doubled since last year. ""We Didn't Have Any Plans"" Rodríguez and his family landed at Baltimore/Washington International Airport on the chilly evening of Thanksgiving Day. The plan was to rent a car, but with his limited English skills he got on the wrong shuttle and wasn't able to get to the rent-a-car facilities located away from the terminal. He had to find a way to get his family to Lancaster, more than 80 miles away. His son called and suggested Uber. Many of the Maria refugees who relocated to the Northeast U.S. this winter found themselves similarly poorly prepared, starting with the weather. (On Christmas Day in San Juan, it was 80 degrees; Lancaster's temperatures hovered just above freezing.) With limited resources, the islanders not only arrived without adequate clothing, but they found it difficult to access assistance in obtaining housing, jobs, food aid, and English classes. ""We didn't have any initial plans or emergency actions,"" says former Mayor Richard Gray, who finished his third term in January. While Orlando and New York have established relief centers, created websites available in Spanish, made communication efforts on social media, and established hotlines to engage with the evacuees, smaller locations have struggled to provide services aimed at refugees, many of whom arrived with little more than the clothes they were wearing. Lancaster, for example, now has a website, but it's only in English and doesn't link the evacuees with local social organizations that provide direct assistance; there's no office, telephone number, or email specifically for newly arrived Puerto Ricans. The municipal government of Lancaster, as in most smaller U.S. cities, doesn't really have the capacity to directly provide residents with social services related to education, housing, or work. ""The city's never had that capacity because of the structure that local government has here,"" Sorace says. ""Our lane is kind of narrow. But what we can do is make sure that the connections are being made to the organization who can."" In his first days in Lancaster, Rodriguez didn't know where to go or who to ask for help. Most of the information was in English, and it was scattered across multiple different sources. Searching for jobs was a challenge, because of the language barrier. He finally found assistance at a local Catholic church, San Juan Bautista, where one of the church's assistants, Edna Lopez, guided him through the process of navigating the school district and eventually hired him as a maintenance worker at the church. So, how does a small city deal with hundreds of people who arrive (legally) after having been displaced by a natural disaster, like any other U.S. citizen would? One answer lies in social organizations like SACA, which has so far assisted 95 Puerto Rican families in navigating the city. For many of these newcomers, the biggest challenge is housing. The average monthly rent for a home in Lancaster exceeds $1,100, and many landlords ask for up to two months of deposit and credit reports—daunting barriers for families that have literally lost everything. The waiting list for federal housing assistance is no longer counted in months, but in years, according to Gray. The lack of coordination between local, state, and federal governments—plus the various non-profits involved—isn't helping either. According to SACA's Cuevas, local non-profits, the school district, and agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent people from one place to another, and evacuees had problems understanding the role of the mayor and the local government; it was SACA, she says, that had to start functioning as the main point of entry to support incoming Puerto Rican families since January 22nd, along with churches and social organizations. ""I honestly have no idea how it works with the local government,"" Cuevas says. ""It's definitely a challenge. It's not organized. They know we'll take care of this whether the money is there or not. And I think that we've done this for so many years they're just used to the fact it will be taken care of."" The Uphill Road It's been more than two months since Carlos Rodríguez and his family arrived in Lancaster. His children, who are 11 and seven years old, are now going to school and learning English. His wife works an early shift in a soda factory; her days begin at 4 a.m. Their combined income from Carlos' job at church isn't enough for them to move out of Carlos' son's house, he says. ""Right now, to get a house, they ask for a credit check. A person like me, who after the storm was left without a job, paid his mortgage a little behind, and comes here [to Lancaster], and they ask you for that—how do they do that? Don't they have a heart?"" His problems are common among other recent arrivals from Puerto Rico, as he has seen. Earlier that day, he says, he met a woman who was desperate to get a job, but she did not know where to look for one, or how to move around the city. Lancaster has a limited bus system with only a few routes in the city. ""The bus does not work well,"" says Rodriguez, who was used to driving everywhere he needed to go on the island. Now, he spends his days walking. When he had to get from his son's house to the post office recently, it took him two hours to walk there, each way. Beyond the immediate needs of housing and work, the psychological trauma facing newly arrived Puerto Ricans is one of the harshest realities tied to the hurricane exodus. Escaping the island has not spared the evacuees of Lancaster from Maria's mental-health toll. ""It's not just walking into the door and needing food stamps, filling an application, getting them and done, you're happy,"" Cuevas says. ""It's the language barrier, [the fact that] your degree that is not valid in Pennsylvania, the housing, the job thing, the weather. It's 'What do I do?' It's starting your whole life again. It's thinking what you left behind."" For Rodriguez, the church has been his foundation, his place of peace, and, for now, a source of faith that things will improve. ""I thought it would be a little easier, but everything has gone uphill,"" Rodriguez says. With his eyes fixed on the ground, he makes an effort not to cry. ""If you do not have faith, you honestly go crazy here, because you do not have a job, because you can not find a home, because you do not have enough money. And in the end, you have no choice. Returning to Puerto Rico is not even an option. I don't even have a place to return to."" This story originally appeared on CityLab, an editorial partner site.

Amy Held,"Beryl, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season was headed for the Lesser Antilles, where it was expected to make landfall by Monday. National Hurricane Center It may be tiny, but Beryl is scrappy. The Category 1 hurricane, the first of the 2018 Atlantic season, strengthened from a tropical depression to a hurricane within 24 hours, surprising specialists who dubbed it "" Brazen Beryl."" By midday Friday, Beryl was churning about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean; it's expected to reach land by late Sunday or early Monday. Forecasters say the storm will likely maintain its hurricane status as it approaches and crosses the islands. ""It is possible that we could have hurricane watches up for some of those islands by tonight,"" said Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center. Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph on Friday afternoon as it churned across the water. ""The hurricane force winds only extend outwards about 10 miles from the center, and the eye itself is about five miles wide"" Berg said. ""So that's just a very tiny system. We don't see many hurricanes that small."" And yet, Berg said the conditions ahead of Beryl could allow it to strengthen a bit over the next few days as it heads for the island chain extending from the Virgin Islands to Grenada. Some of the islands are still recovering from the devastation wrought by September's back-to-back powerful hurricanes Irma and Maria. But those were top-of-scale Category 5 storms. Berg cautioned that because Beryl is so small and located so far out at sea, it's too early to say for sure which islands might be impacted and how badly. ""Regardless of its strength, we would expect it to bring heavy rainfall to some of those islands, which could be prone to flash flooding and mudslides,"" Berg said. Meantime, forecasters are also keeping an eye on a weather system off the coast of North Carolina that could turn into a tropical depression over the weekend. Berg said forecasters aren't expecting it to move inland, ""but it could get close enough to the coast to cause some impacts like wind and heavy rain.""",The Category 1 storm is expected to cross the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean by late Sunday or early Monday.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google.

Sarah Varney,"In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, restorations are being made to a roof in Castañer, a village in Puerto Rico's central mountains. But recovery is slow. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News Helicopters from the power company buzz across the skies of this picturesque valley, ferrying electrical poles on long wires to workmen standing on steep hillsides. The people of Castañer, an isolated village in Puerto Rico's central mountains, view the repairs to the electrical grid warily. Crews have come and gone, and people living along the mountain roads don't expect to get power until late summer, if ever. Power finally started flowing to the center of town last month, but the grid remains unstable, and the hospital continues to rely on its own generator. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last week committed an additional $18.5 billion to help rebuild Puerto Rico, and in towns like this the task looks immense. In front of Johanna Garcia Mercado's home in Castañer, the hillside collapsed during the hurricane. Since then, Mercado (left) has had panic attacks and finds herself crying uncontrollably. She has been seeing a psychologist at the local hospital and a social worker makes frequent visits. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News More than six months after Hurricane Maria, daily life in Castañer isn't close to normal. Children attend school half the day. A nearby school is closed for at least two years, and families who lost their homes have set up beds and couches in its classrooms. The hurricane winds snapped banana trees and ripped up acres of coffee plants here in Puerto Rico's coffee belt. With no harvest this spring, idle men spend hours on the plaza or in the town bar. In the months since the storm, the hospital has become the town's organizing center. From his office there, the hospital's chief executive, Domingo Monroig, looks out onto Castañer's main street, and the entrance to the bar. ""They're getting sick mentally. You can see they're not the same. You can see the frustration."" Mariela Miranda, private citizen offering aid in Castañer, Puerto Rico ""I don't know if the phrase is 'unhappy,' but we call it 'como triste' in Spanish, because it not the same,"" says Monroig of the mood of the town's residents. ""For example, when they have light they are playing in la cancha — the basketball area — or they are in the plaza. But if we don't have light, everybody stays in their home and they say, 'I don't know what to do. It's every day, every day, the same, the same.' "" Many of the town's people continue to experience acute stress and anxiety attacks, says Dr. Javier Portalatin, a clinical psychologist and director general for mental health at the hospital. The hillside collapsed to within 10 feet of Mercado's front door during Hurricane Maria, and she was hospitalized for a month afterward. She and her husband still have nightmares with every storm. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News ""Hurricane Georges was in the nighttime, and we only heard the sounds of it,"" he says, referring to a devastating 1998 storm that hit the island. "" This hurricane we saw in the daytime in this region,"" he says. ""We could actually see what was happening through the windows. I have patients who saw their pets being killed and their neighbors' houses destroyed right next to them. These memories spur their anxiety attacks."" Up a winding mountain road, one of Portalatin's patients, Johanna Garcia Mercado, lives in near-constant fear. Just 10 feet in front of her tiny, dark home, the hillside collapsed during the hurricane; since then, she says, she feels panic rising in her chest and often cries uncontrollably. ""When it rains and thunders,"" says Mercado, ""I'm afraid the steep hillside behind the house will collapse and bury my daughters in mud."" She was hospitalized for a month with all the stress. Mercado says she's considered moving, but this piece of land is all the family owns. Her husband worked on the coffee farm across the road. But with no harvest this year, he is digging up yautia roots, which are similar to turnips, and selling them in San Sebastian, an hour away. The villagers of Castañer are working hard to recover, but their resilience is withering. Even Mariela Miranda, a devoted do-gooder who has taken it upon herself to bring food and water to her bedridden neighbors, is starting to lose heart. She delivers hot rice and turkey stew to a family that is caring for a 59-year-old man in the final throes of cancer. The family relies on a small inverter to power the ventilator that is keeping him alive. They have a generator, too, but today it isn't working. ""It's been really hard because they need a generator,"" Miranda says. ""His machine has to be on 24 hours for the oxygen."" Miranda gets back into the car and heads to her next stop. She's seen case after case of Hurricane Maria's relentless torment: the neighbor sucking for air because he couldn't plug in his nebulizer; the diabetics who can't refrigerate their insulin. (From left) Volunteers Shelley Guerra, Melissa Torres and Mariela Miranda, and caregiver Dalia Marys, surround 109-year-old Virgenia Mendez, who has Alzheimer's. When Mendez' home lost power for four months, her medically prescribed mattress no longer inflated, and she developed bedsores. Sarah Varney/Kaiser Health News She even helps a 109-year-old bedridden woman with Alzheimer's who had terrible bedsores after lying on a medical air mattress for four months that couldn't be inflated because her home had no power. ""They're getting sick mentally,"" Miranda says. ""You can see they're not the same. You can see the frustration."" Even after the power comes back on, Miranda says, her elderly and bedridden neighbors will never fully recover. ""If the light comes back they will still have the mental damage, like they were like abandoned,"" she says. ""This gets to you,"" she continues. ""It drains you. You get so frustrated sometimes. Because there are people that will die."" She recalls an elderly man she used to visit who died a month ago. ""He died because he had [sleep] apnea and he didn't have the power,"" she says. ""So every night he would sleep at the macasina — in the driveway. He would sleep in the driveway, sitting on the couch, because he was scared to die if he fell asleep."" When I ask her who should lead the effort to restore daily life to Castañer, Miranda grows exasperated. ""We hear the help is getting here,"" she says, ""but those of us who visit the houses? We don't see it."" At the Mission La Santa Cruz church, the Rev. Edwin Orlando Velez Castro prepares for Friday night services. Most of the townspeople, he says, were baptized here. Standing in the darkened chapel — there is no power here either — Castro says song is like a prayer to God to change life and make it new. ""Most of the hymns we sing in this time give people faith that God will help us rebuild ourselves and our town,"" he says. ""That is part of our mission — to be light in this darkness.""","Six months after Hurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico, patience in the remote mountain village of Castañer is wearing thin.

Alexis R. Santos-Lozada,"A woman tries to walks out from her house after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Salinas, Puerto Rico, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins The official death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is 64, but transparency organizations estimate the real total is much higher. One estimate puts the count at 1,085. The discrepancy may be a result of how local officials tally deaths. ""If you don't get away from those areas, you are going to die."" That phrase concluded Puerto Rico Secretary of Public Safety Héctor Pesquera's press conference before Hurricane Maria. Three months after the storm, he is one of the fiercest protectors of the official death count. As of Dec. 29, the Department of Public Safety had certified 64 deaths due to Hurricane Maria. However, estimates reported by CNN, The New York Times and others tell a very different story. I was part of the team of demographers that developed the first independent estimates of excess deaths, with the objective of informing the public. Like the estimates published by those media outlets, our numbers contrasted significantly with the official figure. The most shocking results from our study suggest that deaths in September and October were 25 percent above the historical patterns – with about 1,085 added deaths following the hurricane. Determining the number of excess deaths after a natural disaster is not only a mathematical exercise. Undercounting deaths reduces the attention to the crisis Puerto Ricans live day by day. It can also delay international recovery efforts and the approval of policies to help those who need it the most. The Conversation Causes of death Our study compared preliminary data from the Department of Public Safety with historical patterns for the same months in the past decade. In other words, we compared the number of deaths in September and October last year with data from the same period of time in 2010 to 2016. This is how we concluded that there were 1,085 extra deaths, in excess of historical ranges. So why are more than 1,000 deaths missing from the official count? My colleagues and I suspect it may come down to how deaths are recorded by government officials. In Puerto Rico, deaths are recorded using international classifications. This system doesn't capture all of the circumstances surrounding a death that happens following a natural disaster. The death may have been accelerated by some conditions – like difficulty communicating during the emergency. Deaths associated with a particular natural disaster can be classified as direct or indirect deaths. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, direct deaths are those ""directly attributable to the forces of the disaster or by the direct consequences of these forces, such as structural collapse, flying debris or radiation exposure."" ""Indirect deaths"" may be associated with any unsafe or unhealthy conditions before, during and after the natural disaster. For example, Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. So, someone whose life depended on a dialysis machine would no longer be able to use one. In official certificates, their death would be classified as kidney-related and not attributed to the hurricane – even though the death was accelerated by lack of resources required by the patient to stay alive. The same would happen to someone whose life depended on respiratory aid. Their death would be classified as pulmonary-related. Or, say a person feels chest pain and suspects a heart attack. Their immediate reaction might be to call 911. A working communications structure may be able to get help in time and save a life. But in the days following Hurricane Maria, only 25 percent of the cellphone towers were working. Communication was virtually impossible. Under the international system, a death resulting from these circumstances would be classified as a result of a cardiovascular conditions, and would not be attributed to the hurricane either. Revising the death count Ruby Rodriguez, 8, looks back at her mother as she wades across the San Lorenzo Morovis river with her family, since the bridge was swept away by Hurricane Maria, in Morovis, Puerto Rico. Gerald Herbert/AP In light of the mounting evidence, Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló has ordered a review of the causes of death for those who died after Hurricane Maria. The review is a step in the right direction. But will the official count change? Probably not. As of today, the government is requiring families to visit the Department of Public Safety and to report if a death was related to Hurricane Maria. But merely revising the causes of death is not enough to determine whether that death was indirectly related to Hurricane Maria. Those in charge of the death count review will need to interview families and ask them about the conditions surrounding the tragedy. Following the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the CDC published guidelines that state and territorial governments should follow to determine if a death is related or not to a specific event. Following these guidelines could provide the government of Puerto Rico with a more realistic death count. It remains to be seen if the new count will follow this protocol. An accurate death count could be used to inform policies, supplement requests for aid in the national and international context and inform local governments as they prepare for future natural disasters that may impact Puerto Rico, particularly extreme weather events now that climate change is expected to worsen. Hurricane Maria was the first storm to destroy the power grid in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is six months away from the next hurricane season and experts predict it will be an active one. Finally, minimized figures could weaken efforts to provide relief to communities affected by the hurricane at the local and international level. Given that Puerto Rico does not hold political power in Congress, and that the only representative does not vote, it's crucial to convey the reality to all elected officials, so that their votes align with the necessities of those who are still in Puerto Rico.","REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins The official death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is 64, but transparency organizations estimate the real total is much higher.

Camila Domonoske,"An aerial view of Road 2, six months after Hurricane Maria, in Toa Alta, west of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 18. Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images Puerto Rico has experienced an island-wide blackout, seven months after Hurricane Maria hit the island and devastated much of its infrastructure. Every single power customer on the U.S. territory is without power, NPR's Adrian Florido reports from San Juan. More than 3 million people are affected. It's the first total blackout since Hurricane Maria. PREPA, Puerto Rico's electrical utility, says a fault was detected on a transmission line between two power plants and that service will be restored gradually. It could take 24 to 36 hours for power to be restored for some customers, the utility says. Hospitals, the island's main airport, water pumping systems and banking centers will receive priority as PREPA works to restore service. ""In San Juan, officials said a Major League Baseball game between the Minnesota Twins and the Cleveland Indians would go on as scheduled Wednesday evening,"" Adrian reports. ""They said the Hiram Bithorn Stadium had been equipped with generators capable of powering every part of the venue for up to 48 hours."" This is the first complete blackout since the hurricane, but over that seven-month span, the island had never restored full service. Before this blackout began, The Associated Press says, 40,000 people in Puerto Rico still had not regained ""normal electricity service."" And even areas that have had power restored continue to experience periodic outages. In February, an explosion at a power substation plunged San Juan back into darkness. Earlier this month, a tree fell on a transmission line and cut power to more than half the island's population, as Adrian has reported: ""The accident occurred in the region of Cayey, where crews were working to restore power to people still waiting nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria. Increasingly, that work requires clearing away heavily forested mountainsides to gain access to the large utility poles that carry transmission lines from one mountain peak to the next. ""It was during that kind of work that a tree falling toward the ground made contact with the power line instead.... ""In some places that have had their power back for months, like the capital, San Juan, the outage was a humbling reminder that the restoration is not yet complete in more remote parts of the island, and that one mistake still has the ability to ripple back to the island's most populated centers. In places that only recently got their power back, the outage was a frustrating, if not totally surprising, setback."" Why is it so hard for power to be restored in Puerto Rico? As Tim Webber reported for NPR last fall, the island is struggling with an ""outdated, aboveground power grid"" that has lagged behind infrastructure improvements in the rest of America. ""Puerto Rico's debt crisis has prevented much-needed improvements to power plants that are more than a half-century old,"" Tim wrote. PREPA is in debt, and Puerto Ricans pay higher electricity rates than most people on the U.S. mainland despite having frequently interrupted service. After the storm, damage to communications and transportation infrastructure, and a comparative lack of utility workers, have hampered power-restoration efforts. Last month, Adrian reported that people in the mountains of Puerto Rico are frustrated and angry with the uncertainty they've lived with for months — not knowing when the power will come back. Lt. Col. John Cunningham, second-in-command of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' power restoration effort at the time, told Adrian the work has become less predictable. ""All the low-hanging fruit has been, you know, frankly, accomplished at this point,"" he said. ""We're down to the very, very challenging terrain, and the lines are very, very long spans. It's requiring helicopters and then a lot of manual work."" Linemen told Adrian that the work was far more complicated than similar work in the U.S., because of the terrain — and because six months' worth of vines have been growing over the fallen lines. Adrian says that Puerto Rico's government is hoping to finish up power restoration ""before the next hurricane season begins"" — about a month and a half from now.","The U.S. territory was hit by an island-wide blackout, affecting more than 3 million people.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole. That’s according to a study published online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a tricky one. We know that, generally, storms are more intense when the air is warmer, and their impacts on coastlines are more severe when the sea level is higher. But determining whether the odds of a single storm were affected by the warming climate is a science all unto itself. It’s called weather attribution. “We believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Many researchers weren’t sure what to initially think about Harvey when it struck the Gulf in August. Nearly three months later, at least one scientist is offering some answers as to how much climate change impacted the odds of the hurricane that left at least 82 dead and damaged more than 119,000 homes in Harris County, Texas—and how much it’ll continue to boost those odds in the future. Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric science professor at MIT who authored the paper, found that record rainfall—like the 27 trillion gallons of water we saw with Harvey—will become 18 percent more likely to hit the state by the end of the century under a business-as-usual, worst-case-scenario emissions model, which Emanuel uses in the study. Between 1981 and 2000, those chances were slim: 1 percent for a given year. When looking at Houston, specifically, he found that storms like Harvey have historically happened once every 2,000 years, describing it as “biblical,” in a press release. Climate change is changing all that. It already is: Emanuel estimates that, in 2017, those 1 percent odds have increased to 6 percent. “You’re rolling the dice every year,” said Emanuel, in the press release. “And we believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Most climate models available to scientists like Emanuel are too coarse in resolution to simulate the formation of hurricanes. But Emanuel and his team developed one that can model hurricanes at high spatial resolutions within a changing climate. At least one other scientist, atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach, at Colorado State University, knows and trusts this approach. He’s seen this model used in previous research by Emanuel, and “it seems to work fairly well at replicating overall Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach wrote in an email to Earther. “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” But we also know that Texas saw some unique conditions with Harvey that made the storm’s impacts so much worse. For one, Houston didn’t build with storms in mind. Its sprawling development and vast impervious surfaces allowed water to just pool in the city and create flooding like no one ( well, except these journalists ) expected. Then, there were the meteorological conditions surrounding the storm itself. Atmospheric steering currents, which would usually bring a storm like Harvey inland to die, were unusually weak, so the hurricane stayed close to shore picking up more and more water from the Gulf with which to pound Texas. That’s where Klotzbach has some questions: “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” he asked, in the email to Earther. Emanuel ponders this, too, in his study. Still, in an email to Earther, he emphasized his confidence in his methods, which account for both storm movement and changing atmospheric moisture. And this study isn’t the last one coming. He and his team are analyzing how much of the state’s projected rainfall increases will result from either changing atmospheric moisture levels or longer-lasting events. “Preliminary results show roughly equal contributions from both factors,” he wrote to Earther. Emanuel does know some things for certain, though. And he makes note in his study: [A]nthropogenic climate change is expected to lead to a greater incidence of high-intensity hurricanes, which together with rising sea level, will produce increased risk of storm surge flooding, while hurricanes are projected to produce substantially more precipitation as the atmosphere and oceans warm. While it’s difficult to say climate change caused any one storm, we can safely assume climate change will bring about more storms like Harvey, or Irma, or Maria. Research like Emanuel’s gives us a sense of how much more likely these storms will be in the future. And that information will help us prepare.","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole.

Nelida Trinidad walks around her destroyed home in Montebello, Puerto Rico, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Gerald Herbert/AP Revising the death count Given that most estimates, including the most recently published figure, point toward a serious undercount, it's imperative to address this issue once and for all. I have a few ideas of how to move forward. Most importantly, researchers must be able to access data without interventions from the political establishment. So far, no government body at the local or federal level have shared updated counts with the public, and they are actively seeking to dismantle the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics, which is the agency with the power to make them do it. In light of the evidence, Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló last year ordered a review of the causes of death for those who died after Hurricane Maria. They chose George Washington University to run this project. A preliminary report was supposed to be published by the end of May, but it will more likely be published during the summer. Will the official count change? As of today it has not, but it most likely will. The government is no longer updating the official count, which stands at 64, and they are likely to accept the count produced by the George Washington University team. Following the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the CDC published guidelines that state and territorial governments should follow to determine if a death is related or not to a specific event. Following these guidelines could provide the government of Puerto Rico with a more realistic death count. It remains to be seen if the new count will follow this protocol. What deaths should be counted? An accurate death count could be used to inform policies, supplement requests for aid, and inform local governments as they prepare for future natural disasters. That's particularly important for Puerto Rico, where extreme weather events may become more likely as climate change worsens. Hurricane Maria was the first storm to destroy the power grid in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is now entering hurricane season again, and experts predict it will be an active one.

Dell Cameron,"An Air National Guard c-130 cargo plane on Wednesday crashed near Savannah, Georgia, killing at least five on board, authorities said. The plane was on a training mission when the accident occurred at roughly 11:30am local time. The Associated Press reported that between five and nine passengers were on board, reportedly National Guard members from Puerto Rico en route to the US mainland. A photograph tweeted by firefighters at the scene showed the tail end of the plane ablaze alongside Highway 21 near the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. Debris was shown scattered across the road, a pillar of black smoke rising from the flames. A spokesperson for the Savannah Professional Firefighters Association told Military.com that the tail section was the only part of the plane that remained intact. The names of the victims are behind withheld until family members can be notified, authorities said. According to CBS News, the Savannah Air National Guard Base has been heavily involved in the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.","An Air National Guard c-130 cargo plane on Wednesday crashed near Savannah, Georgia, killing at least five on board, authorities said.

Adrian Florido,"Cynthia Caldero and her husband Obdulio Cordero's little wooden home was leveled by Hurricane Maria. But they were denied a FEMA repair grant because they couldn't prove they owned it. After appealing for five months, a nonprofit finally stepped in to helped them rebuild. Adrian Florido/NPR José López doesn't have a deed for the little house at the edge of a dairy farm where he was raised and still lives — only the stories his grandfather told him about how the house came to be. It began with an agreement between gentlemen 39 years ago. His grandfather, a foreman on the farm, needed a house for his recently divorced daughter, López's mother. So he asked the farm's owner if he could have a little corner of the sprawling estate to build her one. ""My grandfather worked on the farm for 44 years,"" López said, ""and his boss was a good man. He said yes."" In the four decades since, the family kept the modest house up – adjusting the floorplan, rebuilding the balcony. Back then, when people made agreements, all that mattered was their word and a handshake. José López ""But Hurricane Maria wiped that away,"" López said. He knew the storm would be a monster. He didn't expect it to tear off the roof. He covered the gaping hole using wood pallets, tarps, and recycled sheet metal. Then a week after the storm, he climbed the hill behind the house in search of cell reception. Using his phone, he filled out an application for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, hoping for a grant to repair the roof quickly. But six months after Hurricane Maria devastated this island commonwealth, he says FEMA has yet to approve his application. The problem is that gentlemen's agreement 39 years ago. ""They say I have to justify why I don't have title to the house,"" he said. ""But back then, when people made agreements, all that mattered was their word and a handshake."" Puerto Rico still has huge challenges ahead, key among them the task of repairing hundreds of thousands of homes that the hurricane damaged or destroyed. One impediment to that goal is the fact that FEMA has denied many families crucial federal repair grants because, like José López, they've been unable to prove ownership of their homes. Villas del Sol is an informal community that was founded in 2010, after its residents were evicted from another parcel of land they had occupied without permission. The community has dozens of homes, but none have individual titles. Adrian Florido/NPR The situation is not without precedent. Some families in New Orleans faced a similar problem after Hurricane Katrina flooded that city in 2005. But in Puerto Rico it is a problem of unprecedented scope, because the island's government estimates that more than half of houses here are ""informal"" – meaning they were built without permits, and lack title. Of the nearly 1.2 million applications for help that FEMA has received in Puerto Rico, roughly 60 percent have been found ineligible for what the agency calls Individual and Household grants, which can but do not necessarily include money to repair storm damage. The reasons for ineligibility are many and the agency did not provide specific denial numbers. But in an email to NPR, FEMA confirmed that a main reason it has denied these grants in Puerto Rico has been applicants' inability to verify that they own the homes for which they are claiming damage. José López says he's spent months trying to get FEMA the documents its workers have told him they need before approving a grant for repairs. Last week, a lawyer helped him write an affidavit swearing the house is his. As he's waited, he's kept making patchwork repairs. His roof looks better now, but he still has to move his mattress to the living room when it rains, to avoid getting wet. Lyvia Rodriguez del Valle works with one of Puerto Rico's largest informal communities, where many residents have been denied FEMA grants because they don't have title to their properties. Adrian Florido/NPR Despite steps FEMA says it has taken to ease its documentation requirements – such as by accepting sworn affidavits from people who lack a deed – housing advocates say many people are still being denied, often for inconsistent reasons that even lawyers are struggling to sort out. ""I've seen many people being denied three or four times, and just deciding it's not worth the stress,"" said Sarah Delgado, an attorney volunteering with a legal aid group that's helping people appeal their denials. ""They're getting discouraged, and they're just giving up."" Many people have few other options for rebuilding, she said. The magnitude of the problem reflects an array of historical, social, and legal factors that have found perfect confluence in post-disaster Puerto Rico. On one side, there's the federal agency charged with providing billions of dollars in disaster relief but also with being vigilant against fraudulent claims, deploying a long list of eligibility and documentation requirements to guard against them. They're requirements that many Puerto Ricans can't meet. On the other, there's an island territory unlike any U.S. state, where property law is different and a majority of houses lack title or proper construction permits. Many cases resemble Jose López's – a house built on a friend or family member's property with their permission. Then there are the tens of thousands of families who live in what began as squatter settlements but over time have taken on the trappings of more formal communities. It's a phenomenon that politicians have often turned a blind eye to, often even abetted, because the proliferation of informal housing has released pressure on demands for affordable housing. Hurricane Maria damaged Angel Manuel Martinez's roof, but FEMA has denied him a grant to repair it in part because he doesn't have the deed. The house is on city land, but it's been his family's for more than 50 years. Adrian Florido/NPR ""It's something that has been there forever, and we were just blessed never to have had a hurricane like the one we did,"" said Fernando Gil Enseñat, Puerto Rico's housing secretary. Hurricane Maria, he said, revealed ""all of the flaws"" in the island's housing policies dating back to the 1930s and 40s, when modernization policies aimed at industrialization drew people from the mountainous countryside to the cities. ""There were too many people coming down and not enough public housing,"" Gil said. ""So what did they do? Parcels of land that were devoted to agricultural sites, people invaded them and made their communities there. Time passed by, nobody paid attention, and meanwhile mayors or representatives started building roads for them, and connecting them into the utility systems."" What many families never got was formal title, and it's one of the major issues the island's housing officials face as they try to figure out how people with no legal right to their properties will get the help they need to repair them. Gil said one plan is to use federal disaster relief money to grant deeds to some 48,000 families that the housing department has record of as living on undeeded property. That number, however, represents only a fraction of such families island-wide. Calls to adjust the rules But housing advocates say such fixes do not address the immediate need that many families still have to repair the roofs over their heads six months after the storm. They argue that the federal government should also recognize Puerto Rico's unique housing reality and adjust its rules accordingly. ""Recognizing that there is an issue of informality in Puerto Rico that's quite widespread, it's very important that the policies that are being implemented find ways to make this assistance available to people that need it,"" said Lyvia Rodriguez del Valle, who directs Proyecto ENLACE, a nonprofit that works with one of the island's largest informal communities in San Juan. FEMA says it is being flexible. For example, it started accepting sworn affidavits from people who can't provide a property deed or otherwise prove that they own their home. ""If they're willing to sign an affidavit that states that that property is theirs, then we're going to honor that,"" said Michael Byrne, the top FEMA official in Puerto Rico. But that does not mean his agency can abandon controls on the housing assistance program, he said. Applicants who've sworn they own their property but are still getting denied are likely missing something else in the application, he said. ""My answer to them is keep talking to us. Come see us."" ""This is taxpayer dollars and we have to be responsible stewards."" Byrne said. ""Not only are we following our rules, but we are also following the rules of compassion."" He said his guidance to staff processing requests for assistance is not aimed at ""incentivizing no's. We're incentivizing doing whatever we can to help the family."" Not only are we following our rules, but we are also following the rules of compassion. Michael Byrne For Cynthia Caldero, it hasn't exactly felt like that. Since Hurricane Maria leveled her tiny one room house, she says FEMA has denied her application for a home repair grant four times. She keeps the denial letters in a little black backpack. ""Assistance not approved,"" they read, ""because you were unable to prove that you owned the home at the time of the disaster."" Though Caldero and her husband built the little house themselves, it's true they can't prove they own it. They live in a community called Villas del Sol, which its residents founded in 2010 after the government evicted them from a parcel of land off the highway that they had occupied without permission for several years. Though their new community is on a flood plain, they at least have permission to be there. But Villas del Sol is built on a single parcel, with no individual titles. After the hurricane crumbled their home, Caldero, her husband, and teenaged son took shelter at the neighborhood's community center, under a small portion of the roof that survived. Every so often, she'd go pick up mail at the post office where she gets it delivered, find another FEMA denial letter, and try again, she said, to justify why she couldn't prove she owned her home. So far it hasn't been enough. ""Now they're requesting a letter from the organization that manages this parcel of land,"" she said, ""So I'm trying to get it. I've already told my husband that if they deny me a fifth time, I'm giving up. I'm not going to ask again."" It's not as urgent anymore anyway, she said. FEMA did replace her destroyed furniture and appliances, and last month a nonprofit showed up and put up four bright blue wooden walls and a roof, allowing her to finally move out of the hollowed out community center and back into her house. If FEMA were to approve her request for help with structural repairs, she said, she'd use the money to replace the thin wooden walls with concrete. ""Otherwise the next hurricane will just blow it all away again,"" she said.","Six months after Hurricane Maria devastated this island commonwealth, many families are unable to get crucial federal repair grants because they've been unable to prove they own their homes.",2018-03-20T19:47:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Unable To Prove They Own Their Homes, Puerto Ricans Denied FEMA Help",https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595240841/unable-to-prove-they-own-their-homes-puerto-ricans-denied-fema-help,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/20/Cynthia_Caldero_wide-6f0445f561d21e26f279d618f73de3890019844c.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane Maria,1
Adrian Florido,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced a deal that would allow billions of dollars in federal disaster recovery loans to start flowing to the hurricane-devastated island. La Fortaleza For months, Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello has been struggling to get the U.S. Treasury to release $4.7 billion in disaster recovery loans that the U.S. Congress approved in October, weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island commonwealth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had delayed releasing the loans because of disagreement over the terms of repayment. On Thursday, the two men said they'd reached a deal to allow the funds to start flowing. ""We've reached an agreement that is beneficial both for the taxpayer and for the people of Puerto Rico,"" Rossello said shortly after meeting with Mnuchin in Puerto Rico's capital. The tentative agreement would allow the island's government to start accessing those funds once the cash balance in its treasury falls below $1.1 billion. Mnuchin had earlier wanted to set that number at $800 million. As of March 9, the island had about $1.45 billion in cash. The agreement ended six months of tense negotiations during which Puerto Rico's governor loudly criticized Mnuchin for what he characterized as overly harsh conditions that the U.S. Treasury sought to impose before disbursing the loans. According to a letter Rossello wrote to Congress last month, the Treasury was demanding that repayment of those loans be given the highest priority, even over the funding of essential services on the island. The governor said the Treasury also wanted to rule out the possibility of future loan forgiveness, a common practice for disaster recovery loans. The agreement they reached Thursday, the governor and Treasury secretary said, would grant high priority to repayment of the federal loans — not above the funding of essential services, but presumably above the more than $70 billion the island owes bondholders. They also agreed to postpone conversations about loan forgiveness. ""We want to make sure that the taxpayers are protected,"" Mnuchin said about possible loan forgiveness. ""It's not something we're going to do for the benefit of the bondholders, but it is something we would consider down the road for the benefit of the people if it's needed."" The officials also said the island would be allowed, as needed, to access the full $4.7 billion legislated by Congress, despite an earlier proposal by the Treasury to cap the available amount at about $2 billion. Rossello has been saying for months that the loan delays were slowing Puerto Rico's ability to recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on Sept. 20, destroying the island's electric grid and damaging hundreds of thousands of homes. Despite the agreement between the governor and Treasury, the deal must still be approved by Puerto Rico's legislature, the federal oversight board overseeing the island's finances, and the federal judge handling the island's bankruptcy proceedings.",Puerto Rico's governor had been locked in tense negotiations with the U.S. Treasury over terms governing $4.7 billion in loans that Congress approved to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria.,2018-03-22T21:29:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Feds and Puerto Rico Reach Deal Allowing Disaster Recovery Loans To Start Flowing,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/22/596196849/feds-and-puerto-rico-reach-deal-allowing-disaster-recovery-loans-to-start-flowin,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/03/22/Rossello_Mnuchin_wide-b6e41ca52104d460fc3c85d66005ad0844222bdf.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane Maria,1
Leigh Buchanan,"In the weeks following Hurricane Maria, Gino Villarini got very popular very fast. Villarini is founder and president of AeroNet, an $11 million Internet service provider based in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Maria ravaged the island's telecom infrastructure. ""The day after, 95 percent of our network was down,"" Villarini says. But AeroNet's service uses wireless microwave technology as well as fiber. So while competitors waited for the power companies to restore poles, Villarini's customers bounced back quickly. Non-customers noticed. ""Our sales staff was overwhelmed by the amount of requests that came in by phone, by email, and by social media,"" Villarini says. ""Our office is not designed to receive more than 10 customers at a time, and some days we had 100 people here waiting to sign up."" The company grew its customer base and gross billing by more than 20 percent in two months. As of June, roughly 10,000 small and midsized businesses in Puerto Rico remained closed, according to Google, whose philanthropic arm raised funds for recovery. Still, now one year after Hurricane Maria wreaked $90 billion worth of damage on the island, some growth companies are thriving. They have seized market share by recovering faster than competitors and offering new products to business customers anxious to limit their vulnerability in case there's a next time. These companies still face significant challenges, including a depleted workforce and insurance companies slow to pay claims. Many are investing more in their own preparedness plans and seeking new business outside the island. ""The companies that survived are doing better than before. They have gotten stronger,"" says Angel L. Perez, vice president at Rock Solid Technologies, a San Juan-based software R&amp;D company that grew 40 percent in the last year. ""Now things are getting back to normal. Or the new normal."" Exports are one reason some Puerto Rican businesses are growing. While companies relying on local customers and the tourist trade still struggle, those that can serve customers elsewhere are making a greater effort to do so. Rock Solid Technologies' business was 65 percent domestic prior to Maria; that is down to around 50 percent, and the company just landed its first big account in Canada. ""Putting more diversity into your customer base is a really good strategy to deal with hurricanes,"" Perez says. Others see opportunities to help the domestic market protect against another catastrophe. Redundancy and backup are the new watchwords. AeroNet has two new products for small business: high-speed internet backup and a pair of independent dedicated connections. ""We found during the hurricane that companies had two providers, but those providers were using the same pole,"" Villarini says. ""So if one came down both connections came down."" For some companies reconstruction is a boon. Initially, business from the mainland declined for Surety One, a $4 million bond-underwriter based in San Juan. But now the company is writing bonds for government contractors involved in the rebuilding. ""It has tripled the amount of business in Puerto Rico,"" says founder Constantin Poindexter. ""It has been a challenging year, but also it has been an amazing year,"" says Christian Gonzalez, whose San Juan-based company Wovenware is up about 15 percent over its 2017 revenue of $5 million. Gonzalez attributes that growth to demand for Wovenware's specialized expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Much of the company's work is for the Department of Defense, in Washington. But it recently signed on with the Puerto Rico Science, Technology, and Research Trust to provide image recognition for mosquitos that might spread diseases like the Zika virus and dengue fever. Four or five mainland companies--a historically large number--have visited Puerto Rico in the past few months to check out Wovenware's facilities prior to signing contracts. Aware of the room's elephant, the company has added a disaster-recovery component to its prospective client presentation. ""We bring it up proactively: How we managed during the hurricane and what we are doing to make sure that they don't have any service interruptions,"" Gonzalez says. Customers, he says, ""look happy."" More business means more staff; and here companies are hurting. Nearly 400,000 Puerto Ricans--roughly 6 percent of the population--moved to the mainland between October 2017 and February 2018, on top of the larger exodus over the preceding decade. Rock Solid distributed $1,000 ""resiliency bonuses"" for ""toughing it out with us,"" he says. ""We have 100 people and we lost just two."" Perez has hired 20 people over the last year, but had to wait for five students who were scheduled to graduate from the University of Puerto Rico last December. Normally Rock Solid makes offers at the school's job fair in October. That was canceled, and then classes extended into February as the university recovered from extensive damage. ""It delayed our whole getting-up-to-speed process. But there was nothing we could do,"" Perez says. At Onuvo, a $1.8 million managed services provider, business has been ""growing like crazy for the last nine months,"" says managing member Juan L. Collado. Collado wants to hire but finds himself in hot competition for the island's reduced workforce. ""Everyone is fighting for the few available resources we still have,"" he says. In January the government raised the minimum wage for employees working on government construction contracts to $15 an hour. Collado predicts service industries will be next. The ripple effect worries him. ""People will move to the government for more income,"" he says. ""In five or six months I'm going to have to increase wages for entry-level employees."" ""We prepared for the normal kind of hurricane,"" Perez says. ""This hurricane was not normal."" Newly woke to the threat of devastation, companies have invested significant time and money to reinforce their disaster preparedness plans. At Rock Solid Technologies, for example, Perez spent several hundred thousand dollars on power and communications redundancy. And he has arranged to fly people to the company's Austin office ""as a precautionary tactic"" if a hurricane of similar magnitude threatens. AeroNet expects employees will stay put, and the company will care for them when they do. To ensure basic needs are met during an emergency it has established relationships with hotels, gas stations, fast-food restaurants, and cafeterias. Putting little faith in the power company, which was ailing even before the hurricane, Villarini has migrated much of the facility to solar. Villarini is also working with vendors to weatherproof equipment that got damaged by Maria. ""A lot of equipment is designed for the outdoors--for rain,"" he says. ""But during a hurricane the water comes in from all sides and places. It even comes in upside down."" Wovenware is improving protocols for keeping management and staff in touch if everything goes down. ""How do we find out if they are OK? At the beginning of the hurricane it was one of our more pressing issues,"" Gonzalez says. At least one radio station managed to broadcast during and immediately after the storm, and some newspapers continued to operate. Gonzalez says he may buy ad space or airtime to reach out to employees, explaining the process in advance so they know where to look or listen. Wovenware will also move to a new building by year's end. The company's current landlord had two generators, but when one failed during the hurricane the second couldn't handle the additional load. Its new location has three generators, Gonzalez says--""so there is a contingency to the contingency."" While some business leaders wax optimistic on the anniversary of Maria, all acknowledge the island's ongoing woes. Some people have come back but more have stayed away. FEMA is providing less financial assistance. Insurance payouts have been slow, say several CEOs, dinging cash flow and slowing progress. ""Just in order to reopen we have to pay someone $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 for cleaning up the area or changing windows or rebuilding the office,"" says Onuvo's Collado, speaking of his own experiences and those of customers. ""If we have to pay out of pocket for those repairs it delays how fast we can recover."" That's on top of Puerto Rico's dismal economic environment, which predates the hurricane. Maria ""was in some ways the straw that broke the camel's back,"" says Poindexter, who cites the economy, crime, and lack of opportunities for young people as reasons for moving his family and part of his staff off the island. After the hurricane five members of Surety One's eight-person team relocated to an office in Raleigh, North Carolina, where Poindexter has another home. His wife and children moved there, too, while other relatives settled in Florida. Poindexter travels among the three locations. ""It sucks, but there are direct flights between all the places I need to go,"" he says. Surety One does business throughout the mainland and in other parts of the Caribbean. So why doesn't Poindexter just pull up stakes and leave? He talks about the high demand for underwriting by the contractors who are busy all over the island. The company is also enjoying a new market among virtual currency startups relocating to Puerto Rico for the favorable tax treatment. Then there more elusive prospects. Could Puerto Rico, with its vulnerable power grid, serve as a test bed for renewable energy projects? There are conversations, he says, about attracting Elon Musk. Fundamentally, though, Poindexter's unwillingness to abandon Puerto Rico is not related to his business. ""It is just very hard to break from a home that you love and a culture that you love and the food that you love,"" he says. ""And who does not want to live on a tropical island?""","Inc.com One Year After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico's Businesses Are Regrouping--and Preparing for the Next Disaster Inc.com In the weeks following Hurricane Maria, Gino Villarini got very popular very fast.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Photo Enid Rosa and her children Ava, 15, and Juan, 9, lost nearly everything during Hurricane Maria, in Puerto Rico. Credit Fred R. Conrad for The New York Times Like millions of others in Puerto Rico, Enid Rosa had her normal life washed away in September by Hurricane Maria. Her house in Rincón, a coastal city on the western edge of the island, was inundated. Outside, the flooding was even worse. “It was really bad,” Ms. Rosa said. “But it was scarier after the hurricane: No food. No water. All our basic utilities lost. It was really after the fact that it got scary.” Ms. Rosa, a single mother of two, had stocked up on bottled water and canned food, but the supply couldn’t last indefinitely. With devastation all around, she felt she had to leave. In mid-October, she took up her brother’s offer of shelter and moved with her children — Ava, 15, and Juan, 9 — into his house in Spring Valley, N.Y. It was a homecoming of sorts for her. Ms. Rosa, 48, grew up in New York but left for her mother’s home in Puerto Rico after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. She was ready then, she said, to “change my life.” In Rincón, she managed a real estate office. Once back in New York, she wasted no time looking for work and found a job in the accounting department of New York Waterway, the ferry and bus service. Still, having lost almost everything to the storm, she needed help rebuilding her life. It came from Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, which used $377 from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to buy boots, coats and other warm clothes for the children, who were about to experience their first winter in the Northeast. The charity also provided book bags filled with school supplies and, for Ms. Rosa, career counseling and appropriate clothes for job interviews. Ava and Juan took readily to their new circumstances, she said. As for herself, “I’m adapting.” “Now I’m working,” she said, “and trying to get myself back together.” Her life from now on will be in the New York region, she said, because “there’s no way I can go back.” The Archdiocese-affiliated organization that helped her get started is one of eight charities that receive donations from the Neediest Cases Fund. The others are Brooklyn Community Services, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, Children’s Aid, the Community Service Society of New York, FPWA (formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies), the International Rescue Committee and UJA-Federation of New York.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, SHERI FINK and MATTHEW HAAG","When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico last year, generators failed at hospitals and nursing homes during prolonged power failures, and deaths from chronic illnesses across the population climbed. Patients having medical emergencies at home are also vulnerable. Medical personnel failed to reach some patients in time after Hurricane Harvey flooded the Houston area last August. On Thursday, relatives of patients at hospitals and nursing homes in areas pummeled by Michael scoured social media and hit redial on their phones as they tried to reach facilities that had not evacuated. Both phone lines are down, said Olivia Ghafoerkhan, 35, whose mother is a resident at River Valley Rehabilitation Center in rural Blountstown, Fla., and has a seizure disorder. Im just worried, if anything happens, in all the confusion, what if someone forgets to give her the medication? So far, at least five people have died from the storm. Bay Medical on Thursday was running with partial electricity from its generators. But there was no water and the toilets were filling up. Windows were broken. One worker said that the fourth floor was flooded perhaps from leaky windows or roof damage. She had tied plastic bags over her shoes and the legs of her scrubs. Dr. Brian Roake, the head of the anesthesiology department, was among those who rode out the hurricane in the hospital. It was like hell, he said. A number of patients had been moved out before the storm. But on Wednesday afternoon, the storm began battering the city and the streets all around the hospital, and soon it became evident that the hospital buildings themselves were not safe.","Debris outside Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Fla., on Thursday.

NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1
Hayden Field,"In the Women Entrepreneur series My Worst Moment, female founders provide a firsthand account of the most difficult, gut-wrenching, almost-made-them-give-up experience they’ve had while building their business -- and how they recovered. When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2018, it left almost insurmountable tragedy in its wake. Although the death toll is widely disputed, one Harvard study estimates a potential 4,645 excess deaths, and the storm likely caused between $40 billion and $85 billion in damage, according to catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide. Businesses -- and plans for businesses -- were also heavily impacted. Valeria Quinones had invested $300,000 to open a Pita Pit franchise, and although her construction site wasn’t destroyed, she faced hunger, power outages and monetary losses. Here, she tells us how she used a new mindset to take her next steps and move forward. What follows is a first-person account of this person's experience. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. “The afternoon after Hurricane Maria, I got in my car and drove. I was franchising a Pita Pit location in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and I had no idea whether my construction site had been hit by the hurricane. I pulled up and saw nothing had happened to it, which was great. But I looked around it, and everything else was destroyed. At that moment, I thought I had lost everything -- my entire $300,000 investment. Listening to the radio, the little information we had was that everything was completely destroyed, including the airport, and that we weren’t going to have power for over a year. It’s the worst news you could ever hear. My first thought was that I couldn’t move forward with my investment, because Puerto Rico was destroyed. There were so many other things to be fixed that took priority -- airports, ports and more. Valeria and her grandfather. Image credit: Courtesy of Claudia Martínez Rivera My family and I were all staying together -- my grandmother, sister, brother-in-law and nephews, ages one and four. The day before the hurricane, everyone went to the supermarket like crazy, buying everything we could find. But after a couple of days, we started running out of food, because there were a lot of us, and no shipments were coming into the supermarkets anytime soon. We were eating about once a day, twice if we were lucky. We went to Popeye’s once and spent three hours in line, and they didn’t have fries or drinks -- just one type of chicken. There also wasn’t any gas for cars, and everyone in Puerto Rico had a 6 p.m. curfew. As the days progressed, I had a lot of time to think. There was nothing else to do -- no phone, television or internet. I reached rock bottom, because I kept acknowledging the reality and severity of the situation. After about two and a half weeks, I thought, I’m going to drive myself crazy if I keep thinking this way, that everything’s destroyed, and we’re stuck. I knew I had to start thinking, there has to be a way to move forward. That’s when I changed my mindset. I had been staying in that negative place because it was comfortable, but I knew I couldn’t survive with that type of thinking long-term. I thought, yes, I have no power, no water and little food in the house, but my store wasn’t destroyed, and everything in it is okay. When you think of an investment, you always think of the big stuff -- if something was destroyed or flooded. But what really hurt me was the small stuff. I was mid-construction, so the walls, painting and wiring weren’t finished, and the kitchen equipment hadn’t been installed yet. How do you finish construction without power or electricity? How do you polish and treat floors without plugging in the machinery? Where can you buy light bulbs if there aren’t any in stock? I technically hadn’t lost anything that I already had, but post-hurricane, I had to put in $45,000 more via an owner’s equity injection due to delays, shortages, construction, rent, equipment and more. As communication began again, little by little, I started to reach out to my contractors to see how they were doing. I knew I had to change the reality of my situation. Everyone was struggling, but there came a time after about two and a half weeks when we all knew we needed to move forward. They wanted to get back to work so they could pay for food. We got together and tried to complete the puzzle day by day. Image credit: Courtesy of Claudia Martínez Rivera Hurricane Maria may have passed, but we’re still seeing the effects of it on the market, economy and infrastructure. Before the hurricane, I had projected my fixed expenses, but that was based on an economy and market that were doing much better. Before Maria, we had about 17,000 people -- a combination of locals and tourists -- per day in Old San Juan. Currently, we have between 6,000 and 7,000. We ended up finishing the store, and it opened on April 6th with great momentum despite a few power outages. I’m shooting to break even right now, open seven days a week and working 16 hours per day to promote customer interest and become established in the market. I’m also launching guerrilla marketing campaigns by way of continuous trial testing and discounts. I feel certain that San Juan will rebound, and it’s important to stay tough so that we can be in that place when the rebound happens. Yes, it’s been a struggle, but it’s been an upward struggle in a positive way. We’re still slowly but surely moving forward.”","Post-hurricane, this Pita Pit franchisee in San Juan dealt with lack of food, gas, power and communication.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - The official estimate of Puerto Rico’s death toll from Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to strike the Caribbean U.S. island territory in nearly 90 years, has been raised to 2,975, up from 64, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Tuesday. The updated figure came from an academic study commissioned by Rossello from George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public health. It calculated the number of deaths that could be attributed directly or indirectly to Maria from the time it struck in September 2017 to mid-February of this year, based on comparisons between predicted mortality under normal circumstances and deaths documented after the storm.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

Dara Kerr,"Tourists can now book experiences in Puerto Rico where they can see the sights and also learn about the local culture. Airbnb Airbnb has a message: Puerto Rico is open for business. The home-rental company said Wednesday that it's expanding its partnership efforts with the island to help it promote tourism. Airbnb said the idea is to assist the country in continuing reconstruction after last September's devastation from Hurricane Maria. Along with donating to local recovery organizations all fees from its bookings in the country over the next three months, Airbnb is launching 50 new experiences throughout Puerto Rico. With experiences, visitors can book local tours, like sailing in San Juan Bay at sunset and hiking in a local nature preserve. ""It's important to encourage people to continue to visit Puerto Rico,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said during a press event at the company's San Francisco headquarters. ""This is a superpower that Airbnb has."" Hurricane Maria is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Puerto Rico. It's winds of up to 175 mph caused floods and devastation that the country is still reeling from. In March, six months after the hurricane, 11 percent of Puerto Rico still didn't have electricity, according to NPR. ""It's no secret that we've been hit hard by the hurricane,"" Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, said at Airbnb's press event. ""This year was a tough year for us."" When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, Airbnb activated its disaster response tool. The way the tool works is the company contacts people in a disaster area asking if they have a room or couch they'd like to offer for free. Respondents can list their space on the company's disaster response portal, which those in need can use to find a place to stay. Though Airbnb typically aims to make a profit off its home rentals, the company is increasingly offering free services to people in need. It created a disaster response tool in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which left more than 100,000 people homeless in the New York City area in 2012. More recently, Airbnb offered places to stay to immigrants who were stranded by President Donald Trump's travel ban and people affected by hurricanes Irma and Harvey. So far, Airbnb has offered its response tool in connection with 100 disasters around the world, Chesky said. Along with donating booking fees, and the 50 new experiences in Puerto Rico, Airbnb also announced Wednesday the launch of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. This joint initiative with the country aims to promote sustainable tourism on the island and encourage visitors to travel to Puerto Rico. ""It's critical that we get tourism back up to normal,"" Rossello said. ""Now, because of the storm, people are aware that there is this small island that has something to offer.""

Adrian Florido,"Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, right, speaks during a ceremony on Capitol Hill on June 27, 2018. On Thursday, Rosselló demanded the resignation of any member of PREPA's board who refused to cut the new CEO's $750,000 salary. Carolyn Kaster/AP The leadership of Puerto Rico's troubled electric utility — PREPA — crumbled on Thursday, as a majority of its board of directors, including its newly named CEO, resigned rather than submit to demands by the island's governor that the new CEO's salary be reduced. The board had named PREPA board member and former General Electric executive Rafael Díaz Granados as its new CEO just a day earlier, at an annual salary of $750,000. His appointment followed the abrupt resignation of Walter Higgins, who had served as CEO for less than four months and announced his departure Wednesday amid a cloud of controversy over his own $450,000 salary. But news of Díaz Granados' even larger salary sparked an outcry among politicians, including Puerto Rico's governor, who was traveling to Russia to watch the World Cup final. On Thursday morning, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló demanded the resignation of any member of PREPA's board unwilling to cut Díaz Granados' salary, which Rosselló called ""not proportional to the financial condition of PREPA, to the fiscal situation of the government, or to the feeling of the people who are making sacrifices to raise Puerto Rico."" A short time later, five board members, including the newly named CEO, resigned, leaving the utility's governing body without a quorum and without a chief executive to replace the outgoing CEO once he departs at the end of the week. In a joint letter to the governor, the resigning board members decried what they called ""the petty political interests of politicians"" who they said were determined to retain control of the utility and who they accused of putting ""at risk"" the process of ""transforming the Puerto Rican electricity sector."" It was a dizzying 24 hours at the already troubled utility, which is bankrupt and $9 billion in debt, has churned through a succession of leaders in the 10 months since Hurricane Maria destroyed the electric grid last fall, and is still struggling to restore power to all of the customers who lost it after the storm. Díaz Granados would have become the fourth CEO since the hurricane, and would have been tasked with overseeing the public utility's privatization, which the governor signed into law last month. In an interview with the island's largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, after his appointment was announced, Díaz Granados defended his salary, saying it was in line with what a utility of PREPA's size and scope would pay a chief executive, and in fact was much less that what he could earn elsewhere. Granados had said one of his goals was to help PREPA retake control of its own future, rather than continue to be ""a spectator"" as outside entities like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dictated the island's energy future. But following his and the other board members' sudden resignation, the government's attention on Thursday turned to simply restoring a quorum to the crippled board so that it could continue to run the utility. The governor said he would act quickly to name replacements, and officials said they expected the new board would appoint another CEO by the end of the week.",Five board members — including the newly named CEO — resigned rather than submit to demands from the governor.

Merrit Kennedy,"Lilian Garcia braids Melody Vasquez' hair as her daughter Jaohnliz plays with her dog Fanny inside Liberata Iraldo, a middle school in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico where they sought shelter after Hurricane Maria. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR A jittery group of middle schoolers are about to start their first day of classes since September, when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico and totally disrupted the island's school system. The vast majority of the island's public schools — more than 98 percent — are open for at least part of the day, according to Puerto Rico's Department of Education. But a small number of schools in Puerto Rico are still not holding classes. Before today, that included the students of Liberata Iraldo. The middle school building they usually attend is being used as a shelter for people who lost their homes in the storm. Because of that, these students, dressed in their pale yellow and blue school uniforms, are about to start class at a nearby high school — Pedro Falu Orellano— in Rio Grande, east of San Juan. The relocation has upset some parents, but the plan is moving ahead because it's not clear where the people living in the shelter will go next. The last several weeks have been tough, with so many kids stuck at home until now. Many students say they've been bored, reading and playing. The area is still without power. It's not clear why it took more than two months to determine a relocation plan. Eleven-year-old Angelisbeth Maldonado says she hopes there will never be another hurricane. ""I don't like going to new schools and learning lost material will be difficult,"" she says. Her family learned she would be starting school at this new location just the day before. It's supposed to be temporary. Nearly 500 students are being relocated from the middle school. Less than a mile from the high school, mother Nadgie De Jesus is rallying with several dozen other parents, students and teachers in front of the middle school-turned-shelter. She's frustrated that her daughter's school is one of just three on the island still being used to house storm refugees. And she refuses to send her to the high school because she thinks it's unsafe. ""We need our school back, that's why we're here,"" she says. Her daughter, Kaylani, says she feels sad and misses her science and music classes. ""I want to see my school again,"" she says. Puerto Rico's Secretary of Education, Julia Keleher, says that they are trying to find solutions for schools across the island that have not yet been able to open. Keleher says she's not completely happy with the quality of education some students are receiving, ""but,"" she says ""schools are open and there is teaching and learning that's happening."" At this new location, the middle and high school students will not overlap in hours, in order to avoid conflict, says regional director Sol Iris Ortiz Bruno. ""After carefully analyzing all factors to be considered, like adequate space, reasonable distance and school security, it is clear that Pedro Falu [high school] is the best choice,"" Bruno said in a statement. ""Once all the refugees at the Liberata Hiraldo School are removed, both schools will return to regular operations."" Middle school teacher Noelanie Fuentes says she keeps hearing different dates about when the school will stop functioning as a shelter – the latest word is Dec. 15. She worries where the people sheltering there will go next. Students look through a fence at the Liberata Iraldo, a middle school in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. The school has remained closed for seventy nine days since Hurricane Maria devastated this Caribbean island because it's still being used as a refuge for displaced citizens. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR ""I don't want them to be thrown out on the street with nowhere to go,"" Fuentes says. In addition to three shelters-turned-schools, there are currently about three dozen other shelters operating in Puerto Rico. The shelter at Liberata Iraldo middle school is hosting nearly 50 people — many sleeping in the classrooms. Stephanie Garcia is one of them, sheltering with her husband and four-year-old son. The family came here after floodwaters destroyed their home, she says, and looters made off with their remaining possessions. They lost their car, too – which meant her husband lost his job. ""We have coped with living in these conditions, for the moment at least,"" she says. Their clothing dries on a line stretching across the classroom, where desks sit in a corner. They pushed several cots together to make a bed. Garcia says that as a mother, she understands why parents want their middle school reopened. She says her family is happy to relocate – they just don't have anywhere to go.","A group of middle schoolers are returning to class for the first time since Hurricane Maria hit the island in September.

Laura Sullivan,"U.S. Army soldiers in Puerto Rico unload food on Oct. 17, 2017. Nearly a month after Hurricane Maria hit, the federal government was still delivering basic supplies, like food and water. Mario Tama/Getty Images A month after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan stepped off a helicopter in the town of Ceiba with a mission: Get relief supplies to people in need. He and FEMA's regional administrator, Thomas Von Essen, told the town's mayor and other mayors from across the island that generators, plastic roofs and tarps would be there within days. ""There are 50,000 more blue tarps coming in over the next week,"" Buchanan said. ""So these will all get pushed to all the mayors."" Von Essen added that FEMA had as many as 500 generators on the island before the storm and would soon distribute them. But today, it's clear none of those promises were kept, and FEMA and the federal government failed on multiple fronts to help the devastated island recover. NPR and the PBS series Frontline examined hundreds of pages of internal documents and emails. Rather than a well-orchestrated effort, they paint a picture of a relief agency in chaos, struggling with key contracts, basic supplies and even its own workforce. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan (left) talks to a U.S. Army helicopter crew member in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico, after a supply delivery mission for residents affected by Hurricane Maria, Oct. 23, 2017. Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images Internal briefing documents show FEMA never had 500 generators on the island before the storm — it had 25. Its plastic roof program was out of plastic, and the most tarps FEMA ever produced was 125,000 — months after people needed them. FEMA's federal coordinating officer for Maria, Michael Byrne, said blame rests with the storm, not with federal responders contending with taxed resources and complicated geography. ""If there's a villain here, it's the 190 mph winds and the 50 inches of rain,"" Byrne said. ""That's the villain. That's what did the damage to the people. We've done nothing but try to remedy that."" Still, as NPR and Frontline traveled the island in the months after the storm, it was clear many of the problems were man-made. In Luquillo, Mayor Jesus Rodriguez said he had been waiting more than two months for FEMA to provide just seven generators that would power the town's water pumps. He said he couldn't understand what could hold up such a critical request in a town that had no running water. ""Water is life,"" he said, frustrated. In Piñones, William Torruella, a pastor, and his congregation spent weeks gathering supplies on their own to deliver to nearby towns. He said when FEMA arrived in Morovis, two months after the storm, he asked what had taken so long. Officials told him the roads to the town had been closed. ""They were not closed,"" Torruella said, shaking his head. ""I've been going there. The excuses do not explain what's happening."" Even an international disaster worker checking on survivors in Yabucoa in January was confused by the delays. ""We were pretty surprised to see how slow the response was [in Puerto Rico],"" said Alice Thomas, a program manager with Refugees International, who has been to more than a dozen disasters. ""Compared especially to major emergencies I've seen in foreign countries,"" she said. ""And we couldn't get over particularly how bad the shelter response was."" The seemingly simple process of distributing tarps to storm victims illustrates the problem. Thomas said storm victims need tarps in the first week or two if they hope to save their homes. ""Why they couldn't get tarps, I do not know,"" she said, adding that federal officials working on the ground called the tarp delays a ""mystery."" When asked what accounted for the delays, FEMA's Byrne said it was difficult to get supplies to Puerto Rico because it's an island. ""We had problems getting everything,"" he said. ""When you have to ship it, you have to add seven days or sometimes longer to everything that you want to bring in. It's definitely a challenge."" Yet 20 years ago, after Hurricane Georges hit the island, there weren't reports of these logistical problems. And the agency's own records reflect a different picture. According to planning and briefing documents, the agency did not pre-position enough supplies on the island before the storm, as federal rules require. The day Maria hit, agency records show, FEMA had fewer than 12,000 tarps on the island. Then, the agency failed to acquire more. First, records show, FEMA hired a company that was just two months old. It didn't provide a single tarp. Then FEMA chose a company whose last contract had been for $4,000 worth of kitchen utensils for a prison. It didn't produce a single tarp either. Contractors apply a FEMA tarp to a home in Morovis on Dec. 20, 2017, three months after it was damaged by Hurricane Maria. The day Maria hit, FEMA had fewer than 12,000 tarps on the island, far below what was needed. Mario Tama/Getty Images Finally, FEMA turned to a third company, called Master Group. Its specialty, according to its website, is importing hookah tobacco. It produced some tarps, but when employees examined them in a warehouse in January, FEMA says, the tarps failed a quality-control inspection. Import records examined by NPR and Frontline show the company brought the tarps in from China, which violates federal contracting rules. After NPR and Frontline questioned FEMA about this, the agency suspended the company. FEMA was also struggling with contracts to deliver food, diesel fuel and other supplies. Byrne said these were just a few troubled contracts out of more than 2,000 that did not have problems. ""We had a couple of ones that didn't work out well and we dealt with it,"" Byrne said. ""I continue [to] focus on getting it solved."" Behind the scenes, though, some federal workers were discouraged. In one email, a top Army Corps official complained to FEMA managers, ""We cannot survive any longer with any delay of materials,"" the engineer wrote. ""I cannot keep saying we are trying.... I need solutions."" The Army Corps' plastic roof program, known as blue roofs, provides stronger roof sheeting tied down to houses. Without tarps, it became even more critical. But FEMA didn't have enough plastic sheeting on the island. In the first month after Hurricane Irma in Florida, records show, the Army Corps put up 4,500 blue roofs. In Puerto Rico, just 439. ""It goes back to how much material do you have?"" said Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, who oversees the Army Corps. ""Almost all the warehouses were empty. So when we hit, the amount of available supplies, either generators, blue roof material, whatever it might be, were just not there... that could have gotten us more of a jump-start.""

Mario Tama/Getty Images When it came to getting the lights on, federal officials chose a contractor named Fluor — a company with global experience building power generation plants but little experience rebuilding the grids that distribute power to communities. Government sources said they went with Fluor because it was a company they trusted, but they also described weeks of bureaucratic delays as the company got up to speed. But that wasn't all that was causing FEMA headaches. FEMA was struggling with its own staff. One internal staffing document reveals that more than a quarter of the staff FEMA hired to provide people assistance on the island was ""untrained"" and another quarter was ""unqualified."" Byrne bristles at the suggestion that FEMA didn't help people. ""I think we've done a lot of support,"" he said. ""How can you look at the fact that we gave a billion dollars in assistance out, that we've given out 62 million liters of water, 52 million meals to the people. How can you categorize that as not providing assistance? I find that that doesn't connect."" Still, he said FEMA will learn from its mistakes. There were ""a number of places where we weren't perfect,"" he said. ""I'll accept that. I'm going to keep working to get better."" Four months after the storm, in a small neighborhood near San Juan called Villa Hugo, local resident Oscar Carrión wasn't waiting for help. He had taken it upon himself to turn the lights on and had already restored power to 3,000 neighbors. ""I'm afraid of heights and of the electrical current,"" he said in Spanish. ""The first time I got up there, I was trembling all over. I still tremble."" Carrión owns a grocery and has four kids. He has no experience working on power poles and doesn't own any safety equipment. He and his neighbors pooled together $2,500 to buy an old rusted bucket truck. On this day, the neighbors unwound wire along the street and Carrión worked pole to pole. ""I guess I am taking a risk,"" he said, ""but it's difficult to live in the dark. We were tired of hearing that they can't get to us. So we've decided to move forward on our own."" As he got back into the truck, he paused for a minute and said, ""If we don't do it, nobody will do it for us.""

Ryan Caron King,"A musical group playing traditional Puerto Rican bomba music performs at a parranda in Hartford, Conn. Ryan Caron King for NPR Merely Torres-Garcia has been living in a hotel room in Hartford, Conn., with her husband and two kids after losing part of her house in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Maria. She said spending the Christmas season in the northeastern cold has been hard for her family. But on Saturday night, in the noisy atrium of Hartford City Hall, it felt a little bit like Christmas on the island. ""My kids are happy. We feel like home in here right now,"" she said. Torres-Garcia was at a Christmas celebration called a parranda, where members of Hartford's Puerto Rican community greeted families displaced by the storm with a musical parade and a hot meal. A traditional Puerto Rican parranda features carolers traveling from one house to the next — sharing food, drinks and singing Christmas songs late into the night. Saturday's celebration happened inside to avoid the cold weather outdoors. But Torres-Garcia said the parranda made her proud to be Puerto Rican. ""It's part of us, what we are,"" Torres-Garcia said. ""We are loud. And we like to dance. We like to sing, we like to do all of that stuff. And that only means — Puerto Rico."" Carmen Cotto grew up in Hartford, and had recently moved to the island before the hurricane flooded her house. She said the event started the Christmas season for families who have focused more on recovering from the hurricane. She said that many Puerto Ricans start celebrating right after Thanksgiving. ""Christmas hasn't really started for many. And this was like our kickoff for Christmas,"" Cotto said. Cotto's father Angel Luis also came to live in Hartford temporarily after the storm. He said he enjoyed the night's festivities — but he wants to go home as soon as he can. ""It's different, different, different,"" he said. ""It's nice over here, but it's no place like Puerto Rico."" Luis said he was sad during the parranda as he thought about all the people still suffering on the island. But he said at the same time, he was also happy — because this was the first time they had gotten to celebrate since the storm.

WRAL,"By Alfred Charles, Online Managing Editor and Joe Reedy, Associated Press Raleigh, N.C. — Friday marks the official start of the hurricane season and forecasters say it appears that this could be a ""normal"" year after hurricanes Irma and Maria were blamed for several deaths and millions of dollars in damages. ""It's June 1, so here we go,"" said WRAL meteorologist Elizabeth Gardner. ""It's the official start to the hurricane season."" &amp;bullet; Hurricane names for the 2018 Atlantic season The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a normal to near- or slightly above-normal hurricane season this year with 10-16 named storms likely to develop. The tally for a normal year is 12 named storms, Gardner said. She said there are two factors that will determine the number of hurricanes: Sea-surface temps. Gardner said if ocean temperature hits 80 degrees or higher then that will increase the chances for more hurricanes. ""The warmer the temperatures are, the more storms we'll see,"" Gardner said. El Nino. The extended forecast calls for an el Nino system, which will mean more wind shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere. But Gardner cautioned that the system will be weak so that could mean a minimal effect on hurricane formation. The hurricane season last year culminated with 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes. The Atlantic basin annually averages 12 named storms, with six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. &amp;bullet; 2018 hurricane season could be as busy as 2017 NOAA added that there is a 75 percent chance that the 2018 season will see near or more than the average number of storms in the basin. Florida preps for hurricane season Florida's governor and Legislature promised a dizzying array of fixes following the devastation of last year's hurricanes. But heading into a new storm season, the state has enacted only a few changes — the largest aimed at protecting seniors in nursing homes. &amp;bullet; Looming hurricane season a reminder that NC must do more to mitigate flood risk Friday's official start of hurricane season also arrives as the state continues to feel the effects of two storms last year. Hurricane Irma ripped across the state last September and was blamed for 84 deaths in Florida, as well as over $8.6 billion in property damage. Hurricane Maria, which decimated Puerto Rico last October, led to mass relocations to the Sunshine State. After having no significant storms from 2006 to 2015, three storms have made landfall in the state the past two years. ""As hard as it was last year, people worked together well,"" Gov. Rick Scott said recently at the Governor's Hurricane Conference in West Palm Beach. ""I think almost everyone is pleased with debris removal, but it is the rebuilding that takes time."" The Florida House of Representative's Select Committee on Hurricane Response and Preparedness issued 78 recommendations over the past year, with 27 being acted upon, mostly as appropriations in the state budget. The recommendations ranged from ensuring generators and three days of fuel in nursing homes and assisted living facilities to creating a disaster preparedness sales tax holiday. Priorities for most people remain ensuring access to fuel and transportation, following a massive and chaotic evacuation during Irma that left residents scrambling for fuel and clogging Florida's highways. Scott directed the state's Department of Transportation to better identify larger gas stations along evacuation routes and improve delivery of fuel to those areas. Legislators recommended having the state consider using one-way traffic flows on major highways, but Scott, citing state transportation officials, instead backed the use of highway shoulders to relieve congestion. Authorities allowed drivers to use shoulders several times during Irma. Craig Fugate, who was the state's top emergency official under Gov. Jeb Bush and later headed FEMA under President Barack Obama, said one way to ease congestion during evacuations is pointing people to shelters closer to their homes. ""If you look at last year we had a lot of people driving long distances. We have so many new residents that we forgot past lessons,"" he said. ""How do you keep them engaged and prepared and pass on the lessons that we learned the hard way between the quiet and active periods?"" One way could be through improvements in forecasting from the National Hurricane Center. Director Ken Graham said new public advisories are ""absolutely huge"" for the work emergency managers do ahead of any storm. Those include the expected time for tropical storm-force winds to arrive onshore and maps that show possible storm surge. ""It's about understanding the risk, it's understanding if you're in an evacuation zone, and understanding you may not have far to go to get away from that risk,"" Graham said. The state also has named a new top emergency management official, Wes Maul, following the resignation after seven years of Bryan Koon, who said he would return to the private sector. Maul served as the department's chief of staff for 17 months but had no other prior emergency management experience. Maul declined to answer questions about his level of experience, but the governor's office has cited Maul's work at the department so far — including responses to storms and mass shootings — as an indicator that Maul is up to the task. The governor is confident in Maul, Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis said. Graham said his office's job with any new officials ""is going to be to educate.... We're going to spend time spinning them up on the hurricane season, spinning them up on the science."" Scott, a Republican, is leaving office due to term limits. Florida has not been hit with a hurricane the year of a gubernatorial election since 1964. The state's response during a storm could quickly become a campaign issue for governor and the U.S. Senate as Scott is challenging three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in November. Fugate said no matter the year — or the stakes — the mission remains the same. ""They have to be ready for stuff you would expect, but also be prepared for what could happen,"" he said. ""We have our planning assumptions, but you also have to adjust to what the public is doing."" ___ Associated Press writer Jennifer Kay in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public’s consciousness by the next one.

Flora Carr,"Puerto Rico has been plunged into darkness after an explosion and fire at an electric substation on Sunday caused a widespread blackout. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) told the Associated Press that much of northern Puerto Rico, including parts of the capital, San Juan, as well as Guaynabo, Carolina and Juncos, remained without power in the wake of the explosion, but it hoped it would be restored within a day. The blackout marks a setback in efforts to restore power to Puerto Rico, five months after Hurricane Maria wreaked widespread devastation and led to the longest blackout in U.S. history. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tweeted an image of a solar light following the blackout. She also added an update on the fire, tweeting: “It appears fire has almost totally been extinguished and the cooling phase is beginning.” PREPA officials told CNN that the fire had been caused by a mechanical failure. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September, causing homes to be flattened and a total blackout across the island. Puerto Rico’s power grid was already vulnerable; PREPA’s power plants were 44 years old on average, in contrast with the industry average of 18 years. In December last year, TIME reported that the death toll on the island following the storm now exceeded 1,000 people.",Much of the island was already still without power after Hurricane Maria struck,2018-02-12T14:30:49Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Puerto Rico Is Facing a Major Blackout After a Power Station Exploded,http://time.com/5144110/blackout-puerto-rico-explosion/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/puerto-rico-blackout.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Maria,1
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"He’s the only Democrat running for Senate, the canvasser informed her. “Or I could vote for Mickey Mouse,” Ms. Charboneau joked. (The Disney character is, in fact, occasionally listed as Florida voters’ write-in choice.) What may be Mr. Nelson’s most serious shortfall in the race so far is his failure to keep up with Mr. Scott in campaigning to a key demographic group: the state’s Latinos who tend to vote less Democratic in Florida than elsewhere in the country because many of them are Cuban Americans who historically lean Republican. Mr. Scott, who learned some Spanish before his 2014 campaign, broadcast two Spanish-language ads on Telemundo last month during the World Cup. The network drew higher ratings in South Florida than anywhere else in the country during the tournament. Poll after poll has shown Mr. Scott holding his own among Hispanic voters, including Puerto Ricans who relocated to Florida after Hurricane Maria and were expected to lean toward the Democrats. The Puerto Rican influx so far has not been accompanied by a surge in Democratic voter registrations in Central Florida, a swing region, according to data tracked by Steve Schale, a Democratic political consultant. The same polls suggest how Mr. Nelson might win over those voters: by tying Mr. Scott to Mr. Trump, who remains unpopular among Puerto Ricans because of the federal government’s slow and problematic relief efforts after the hurricane. Mr. Nelson was recently endorsed by Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan, who became a darling of the political left after criticizing Mr. Trump’s response to the storm. And at the Miami campaign event, held at a new Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Nelson was welcomed by a former mayor of Miami, Maurice Ferré, a Puerto Rican who praised the senator for having first telephoned him a decade ago to discuss matters important to the island. Mr. Ferré declared that Mr. Nelson has “el corazón boricua,” a Puerto Rican heart. Even so, Armando Figueroa, a Puerto Rican sipping a Medalla beer at the bar, said he had no idea who Mr. Nelson was. Mr. Figueroa has lived in Florida for six years. “We Puerto Ricans love politics — it’s like a sport — and I watch the local news; he doesn’t appear on there much,” said Mr. Figueroa, 41, who like many Puerto Ricans is registered to vote without a party affiliation. “He’s Rick Scott’s opponent?

Danica Coto / AP,"(CAROLINA, Puerto Rico) — Before the sun rose on the first day of 2018, someone called 911 to report the charred, bullet-riddled body of a man with a snake-like tattoo on his left hand, lying beside a road in the Puerto Rican town of Vega Baja. The next day, two men were found dead with their feet and hands bound in Bayamon, a working-class city southwest of the capital. Another man was shot to death before dawn in nearby Vega Baja while trying to stop thieves from stealing his generator. Thirty-two people have been slain in Puerto Rico in the first 11 days of the year, double the number killed over the same period in 2017. If the surge proves to be more than just a temporary blip, January could be the most homicidal month on the island in at least two years, adding a dangerous new element to the island’s recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst disaster in decades. While the number of homicides did not immediately spike in the weeks after the hurricane struck on Sept. 20, police and independent experts say many killings appear at least partly related to its aftereffects. The storm has plunged much of the island into darkness, increased economic hardship and contributed to a sickout by police, all fueling lawlessness. What’s more, officials say a turf war has broken out among drug gangs looking to grab territory after the storm’s disruption. “Hurricanes affect everyone, including criminals,” said criminologist Jose Raul Cepeda. Already bankrupt, the island’s overwhelmed government has fallen behind with millions of dollars in overtime payments owed to police officers, who have begun calling in sick in big numbers to protest. The sickout has taken about 2,000 police off the street each day in a territory that has 13,600 officers. It has forced more than a dozen police stations to close for several hours to a couple of days during the holiday period because of a lack of officers. No arrests have been made in the 32 killings this year. Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm, destroyed much of the island’s electrical grid. For those police on duty, the streets are darker and more dangerous because power has been restored to only 60 percent of customers in the U.S. territory. Drug gangs are fighting to re-establish territory they lost in the disruption from Maria, which pushed thousands from their homes and left entire neighborhoods uninhabitable for weeks. Police Chief Michelle Hernandez resigned Monday after only a year on the job, and local and federal authorities are rushing from meeting to meeting to debate how to best protect 3.3 million Puerto Ricans, especially those still living in the dark. “This has been devastating,” said Ramon Santiago, a retiree who lives less than a block from where three bodies were discovered Sunday near a basketball court. “You can’t sleep peacefully in so much darkness.” Puerto Rico’s homicide rate is roughly 20 killings per 100,000 residents, compared with 3.7 per 100,000 residents on the U.S. mainland. In the last two years, Puerto Rico has seen an average of 56 homicides a month, a rate that held through December. Then after New Year’s, the killings started accelerating. A man was shot Jan. 3 by a security guard while trying to rob a bakery. Two double homicides were reported Jan. 8 — two men found shot to death in a car near an upscale resort on the north coast and two other men discovered sprawled on the street near a public housing complex on the west coast. Five killings alone were reported Monday, in addition to three people wounded by gunfire during a shootout that night in the parking lot of a strip mall in Bayamon. This week, police say, the son of a former judge was killed after trying to write down the license plate number of a car whose occupants were firing a gun. “The lack of police is increasing Puerto Rico’s safety issues,” said legislator Denis Marquez, who was mugged at gunpoint last month. “Everybody is feeling that insecurity.” Besides policing and getting the lights back on, he said, the government needs to address long-standing issues such as social inequality on an island with a 10 percent unemployment rate, where nearly 45 percent of its inhabitants lived in poverty before the hurricane. More immediately, the post-storm conditions have fueled a deadly struggle over drug gang territory, said Fernando Soler, vice president of a police officers’ advocacy group. “There’s a war over the control for drugs,” he told The Associated Press. “They are taking advantage of all the situations occurring in Puerto Rico. There’s no power and they believe there’s a lack of police officers. … Criminals are taking care of business that was pending before the hurricane.” Inspector Elexis Torres heads a unit that is investigating eight homicides in a jurisdiction that includes the working-class city of Carolina near Puerto Rico’s north coast, bordering the island’s main airport. One of Puerto Rico’s largest cities with nearly 160,000 people, Carolina had the triple homicide reported Sunday; a motel employee and a friend were found slain Tuesday in neighboring Trujillo Alto. Like nearly all the killings this year, they involve men in their 20s who were shot to death. Torres said he suspects both cases are drug related. He worries the number of killings will only increase as criminal gangs enter into cycles of revenge. “Those victims likely belonged to some organization,” Torres said of the triple homicide. “This can have consequences.” Cepeda, the criminologist, said drug traffickers have been entering rival territories to increase sales and recover losses after the storm disrupted their business. Hurricane Maria caused an estimated $95 billion in damage, with 30,000-plus jobs lost in an economy that was already struggling from an 11-year-old recession. The last time Puerto Rico saw a spike in violent crime was in 2011, when a record 1,136 killings were reported on an island of nearly 4 million people. Puerto Rico had seen a drop in killings, to 700 in 2016 and 679 last year. Hector Pesquera, secretary of the newly created Department of Public Safety, met this week with top police officials and federal authorities. “We’re in a process of analysis and of committed work to fight criminality in Puerto Rico,” he said.",32 people have been killed in the first 11 days of the year,2018-01-11T20:57:36Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Murders in Puerto Rico Surge as Hurricane Maria Recovery Continues,http://time.com/5099781/puerto-rico-murder-rate-hurricane-maria/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/puerto-rico-murder-rate-hurricane-maria.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Maria,1
Daniella Cheslow,"Gabriel Hernandez is one of two Puerto Rican chefs named as semifinalists for the best chef of the South category in the 2018 James Beard Awards. The recognition comes as the island's restaurants recover from Hurricane Maria. Daniella Cheslow/NPR Finalists for the James Beard Awards — known as the Oscars of the food world — will be announced Wednesday. Among those waiting to hear if they made the cut are two chefs from San Juan, Puerto Rico, who are nursing their restaurants back to life six months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Chef Gabriel Hernandez slept on his restaurant floor for three weeks and served iceberg lettuce when there was little other produce available. Jose Enrique opened his eponymous restaurant as a staging kitchen for José Andrés' mass-cooking charity operation before his generator died. Both chefs were named as semifinalists for the Beard awards last month. ""It [was] an amazing surprise,"" says Hernandez, a first-time semifinalist and the chef and co-owner at Verde Mesa in Old San Juan. ""Especially these last couple of months have been a really hard process to restore the restaurant."" In December, Hernandez spoke to NPR during the lunch service at Verde Mesa. Then, as now, he had not resumed dinner service due to lack of clientele. He had three cooks instead of the nine who worked before the hurricane. His credit card machine didn't work. His air conditioner was still broken after the storm broke his compressor. But at least his restaurant was open. After the hurricane hit, Hernandez had to camp out in Verde Mesa — with power out across the island, his electric storm shutters at home would not open. Hurricane Irma, which hit in early September, had depleted his emergency savings, leaving him exposed when Maria made landfall two weeks later. Even if he had re-opened his restaurant back then, he says, ""there was no economical movement in San Juan."" Hernandez was only able to reopen in early November because a guest knocked on his door and offered him a generator. He rewired his kitchen to use only one electrical appliance instead of four and used Sterno cans to heat a stew menu. ""And then we used whatever we can do in our power to make great, amazing appetizers using whatever we can find,"" Hernandez says. ""That was the challenge."" Nearly all of Puerto Rico's food is imported from the mainland U.S. In recent years, amid an economic recession on the island, a local farm movement blossomed, including several farm-to-table restaurants. Hernandez says his restaurant aims ""to create a new culinary identity"" for Puerto Rico. But after the storm, about 80 percent of the island's meager crops were destroyed. In December, Hernandez celebrated the return of fresh radishes, butter lettuce, eggplant and chayote, a local squash. He served the chayote thinly sliced with chunks of mango and flecks of cilantro and black sesame as a tangy appetizer. Also on the menu: Serenata de Bacalao, a salad of yams, hard-boiled eggs and cod, which traces back to Spanish colonists who packed their barges with the dried salted fish. In December, Puerto Rican chef Gabriel Hernandez celebrated the return of locally grown radishes. Most of the growers that supplied his restaurant saw their crops destroyed during Hurricane Maria. Daniella Cheslow/NPR Hernandez is an accidental chef. He studied electronics engineering technology but found he didn't like the field. So he started working as a runner in a local restaurant, then became a waiter and bartender. Nine years ago, he and a partner decided to open a simple soup and salad eatery in Old San Juan. In the beginning, ""we didn't have the money to hire a chef, so I started working in the kitchen,"" he says. Verde Mesa evolved over the years and moved to a bigger space seating 40, with airy windows letting in a sea breeze and vintage chandeliers hanging amid sea green-painted walls. Eventually, Hernandez says he hired a professionally trained sous chef and kitchen supervisor. He says he paid his sous chef a salary even when his restaurant was closed after Maria because he imagined he would be crucial to recovery. ""Starting over without a sous chef I've been training for so many years [would be too] hard,"" Hernandez says. For Jose Enrique, James Beard recognition is an annual exercise. He has been a semifinalist or nominee for the best chef of the South category each year since 2013. Enrique trained at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and cooked in New Orleans. About a decade ago, he moved back to Puerto Rico and took over a restaurant in an old house in San Juan's Santurce neighborhood. His restaurant has no sign to mark its presence, but it is steps from La Placita, the market square where each night locals drink and dance to salsa music in a handful of bars. Enrique says before the storm, his restaurant had become a pilgrimage point. Lines snaked out of the charming veranda; guests waited as long as two hours to grab one of his 37 seats. He managed to stay open for about 10 days after the storm thanks to a generator. During that time, celebrity chef José Andrés enlisted Enrique — and his restaurant's kitchen — in his mission to feed the hurricane victims. ""Those first 10 days we were pumping food out for the island. Those first 10 days we worked was volunteering,"" Enrique says. Then his generator died and he could not get it fixed amid the surging demand. So Enrique closed the restaurant for nearly two months. ""I tried to do something every day in the restaurant – open the windows, clean.... It was a rough time,"" he says. He finally reopened after electricity was restored to San Juan. ""I think if we would have had another two weeks without power, we would have been closed "" for good. Before the storm, Enrique says he had days when nearly 75 percent of his menu was locally sourced. Now, he is far from that. ""Even now it's hard to get plantains, which is something everybody eats here every day,"" Enrique says. The James Beard Foundation will announce its shortlist of nominees Wednesday. Myriam Ocasio, a local food writer, says she thinks a win is a ""long shot"" for either Hernandez or Enrique. It's not because of a lack of talent, Ocasio tells NPR in a an email, but because the awards have tended to "" pick chefs from the mainland, overlooking ours. I feel that Puerto Rico is the culinary destination of the Caribbean, but we just have not been recognized as such."" Enrique says regardless of how the awards turn out, Puerto Rico is experiencing a rebirth. He says his business has recovered to two-thirds of its former volume. Before the hurricane, he says, local growers were cultivating ""beautiful carrots"" and flavorful honey. Now, he says, that farming movement is showing signs of life again. ""I believe it's going to come back bigger than before the hurricane,"" he says.","After hurricanes Irma and Maria, these chefs defied the destruction, kept their restaurants open and fed hungry victims.

THOMAS KAPLAN,"Photo Damage from Hurricane Maria in Utuado, Puerto Rico, was still visible last week. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. Credit Alvin Baez/Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief from this year’s devastating hurricanes but urged lawmakers to make spending cuts to offset disaster costs that are now approaching $100 billion. The White House request for more disaster relief after the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, set up a possible confrontation over whether Congress must to find spending cuts to pay for relief even as President Trump pushes for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. White House officials suggested a raft of cuts to pay for the relief, including $730 million from the Army Corps of Engineers’ operations, maintenance, flood control and coastal emergencies funds, $196 million from the Department of Agriculture’s rural economic development program, and $72 million from the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The State Department’s Democracy Fund would lose $99 million and the Department of Transportation highway aid to states would lose $1 billion. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, immediately rebuked the White House over its requests to offset the funding. “Just one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement. “Holding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.” Republicans have been conspicuously quiet about their concerns over adding to the ballooning national debt. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

The project, which began as a Google X Lab offshoot, provides basic internet to crisis zones and out-of-network areas using weather balloons. In the wake of Hurricane Maria devastation, Project Loon procured an emergency license from the FCC to send its balloons to Puerto Rica on the US Virgin Islands. “In times of crisis, being able to communicate with loved ones, emergency services and critical information is key,” Project Loon project lead Alastair Westgarth, said in a statement shared with Gizmodo, thanking AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, which the project collaborated with.

MARK LANDLER,"Mr. Trump landed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, on the Neuse River. The Neuse swamped the nearby city of New Bern and is now threatening inland cities like Fayetteville and Kinston. In New Bern, a picturesque town of gracious houses with river views, rescuers plucked more than 200 people from the rising waters. Mr. Trump brought along a big delegation, including four Republican senators: Richard Burr and Thom Tillis from North Carolina, and Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott from South Carolina. The secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen; the budget director, Mick Mulvaney; and the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, were also on Air Force One. The president clearly relishes visits to storm-ravaged places. There are urgent briefings by state and local officials, usually accompanied by charts and abundant gratitude for the strong support from Washington. There are dramatic helicopter tours over waterlogged landscapes, and photo-ready visits to battered neighborhoods, where Mr. Trump often banters with the residents as if he were still on the campaign trail. But these visits have also produced some memorably off-key moments. Last summer, the first lady, Melania Trump, raised eyebrows when she emerged from the White House in needle-thin heels for a visit to Texas after Hurricane Harvey (she later changed into sneakers). Mrs. Trump did not accompany her husband on Wednesday. In October, Mr. Trump tossed rolls of paper towels to victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. His performance seemed even more discordant in retrospect, after his unfounded claim last week that the death toll on the island had been inflated as part of a Democratic plot to discredit him — a claim defended by the administrator of FEMA, Brock Long.","President Trump greeted Brock Long, the administrator of FEMA, at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina.",2018-09-19T15:36:13Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Arrives in North Carolina to See Hurricane Florence’s Devastation,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/trump-carolina-visit-hurricane.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/20/us/politics/20dc-trump1/20dc-trump1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Maria,1

 (CNN)At any given moment, Dan Schachner, who has been refereeing the Puppy Bowl for eight years, can be found buried under a pile of puppies or shouting encouragement like, ""Amazing work, Pistachio!"" to a tiny white Maltese from Every Dog Counts Rescue in Indiana. 
Schachner, an actor and also a dog foster parent, wants everyone who watches the Puppy Bowl, which airs just hours before the Super Bowl, to not simply enjoy the heartwarming nature of the games, but to learn more about the importance of adopting pets from local shelters and supporting rescue groups. 
In other words, the Puppy Bowl isn't just meant to be a frivolous distraction; it's a carefully orchestrated event that seeks to raise awareness about the importance of animals and their health and safety. Each year, when people make the decision to add a pet to their family, they often decide to buy one. The Puppy Bowl, which puts every puppy who participates up for adoption, uses its platform to dare us to adopt instead, making the poignant case that adopting a pet is saving a life.
The Puppy Bowl may be succeeding in its mission. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals, some 6.5 million companion animals enter US shelters each year. If those animals don't get adopted, they risk being euthanized. In 2011, roughly 2.6 million shelter animals were euthanized. But those numbers have dropped to 1.5 million per year. Schachner, who has been moved to see more and more animals adopted each year, tells me, ""I'm not saying it is because of us, but we are part of a movement that is increasing awareness."" 
So, how does Schachner persuade viewers to get involved in pet adoption? I refer you to this year's Puppy Bowl. 
During 2019's prefilmed event, which I covered, Schachner shared the football field with 96 puppies, 36 of which have special needs. The dogs were divided into Team Ruff and Team Fluff, and they competed for the Lombarky Trophy in a game that roughly resembles football but is mostly chaos. 
The halftime show featured a variety of other animals: dozens of kittens, some of whom jumped out of a large cardboard cake; a sloth eating pieces of fruit; baby porcupines who shyly chased each other in circles; a baby kangaroo who jumped in and out of a cloth purse backstage; and a capybara who was most excited about eating the corn on the cob offered by his handler. Youth volunteers lined the sides of the field and made sure no puppies, porcupines or other animals fell off the stage during the game. 
Where does the event get its star players? Every year, the Puppy Bowl includes dogs from many shelters -- 53 in total this year. One of those is The Sato Project, which is dedicated to rescuing abused and abandoned dogs from Puerto Rico. Although the Puppy Bowl has worked with The Sato Project for years, this year the organizers wanted to include a dog from Puerto Rico in the Puppy Bowl and use his story to highlight the toll of Hurricane Maria on the island.
To recruit dogs for the 2019 Puppy Bowl and raise awareness about the plight of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, Schachner and other members of the Animal Planet team traveled to Playa Lucinda last summer. Unfortunately, after Hurricane Maria, many people were forced to abandon their dogs because they were focused on their own survival, and the shelters on the island have been overwhelmed. 
After a natural disaster, human lives take priority, but it is also important to think about pets that get left behind. As Schachner explained to me, the trip to Puerto Rico brought home the toll of the hurricane on humans and animals: ""There is still a lot of work to be done. My biggest takeaway from Puerto Rico was that the commonwealth needs more help."" 
When the Puppy Bowl launched in 2005, the goal was to get all the dogs adopted. Since then, the organizers have expanded their mission to include highlighting the story of the dogs and the shelters that support them across the United States and Puerto Rico. 
This year, puppies from cities like Miami and Houston, which have experienced natural disasters, will be competing. In sharing the stories of these puppies, the Puppy Bowl hopes to bring attention to areas of the country that have been hit hard by natural disasters. 
Schachner sees his job as referee as giving him the opportunity to let people know about the joys of fostering and adopting animals. It makes him proud to be part of an event that raises awareness about adoption. ""Dogs ... make us more human and they make us better people,"" he says, before running onto the field to pick up and kiss Lola, a shar-pei from Florida Little Dog Rescue, congratulating her on a stunning play. 
So, tune in -- and don't be surprised if these stories bring you to tears (happy ones!) and make you want to adopt a furry friend from your local shelter.","At any given moment, Dan Schachner, who has been refereeing the Puppy Bowl for eight years, can be found buried under a pile of puppies or shouting encouragement like, ""Amazing work, Pistachio!"" to a tiny white Maltese from Every Dog Counts Rescue in Indiana.",2019-01-30T21:32:53Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Why you can't miss Puppy Bowl 2019,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/opinions/puppy-bowl-importance-adoption-rescue-alice-driver/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190130133224-04-puppy-bowl-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Maria,1
ABDULLAH SHIHIPAR,"According to statistics collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation, black people made up 12 percent of all opioid-related fatal overdose victims in 2017, with 5,513 deaths, more than double the number in 2015. (Non-Hispanic whites accounted for 78 percent of all victims 37,113 deaths in total, a 37 percent increase from 2015 and Hispanics 8 percent.)
Twelve percent may not seem like a lot, but it is roughly proportional to the number of African-Americans in the United States population as a whole. In some areas, most victims of fatal overdoses are black, as in the District of Columbia, where black people make up more than 80 percent of opioid-related deaths. In Massachusetts, meanwhile, opioid death rates are going down for all other groups, but continue to rise for black people.
Dr. Tom Gilson, a medical examiner in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, told the Boston NPR affiliate WBUR that there was a Fourteen-fold increase in fentanyl deaths among African-Americans in three years; most of those deaths involved fentanyl mixed with cocaine. A recent study found that between 2012 and 2015, black men died from cocaine overdose at rates as high as white men who died from opioids during that period. If fentanyl-laced cocaine becomes more common, overdoses among black Americans could get much worse.
Native Americans have also been hit hard by the opioid crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1999 and 2015 Native Americans had the largest increase in overdose deaths compared to other groups. The C.D.C. also reported that in 2016, rates of prescription-opioid-related overdose were higher among both non-Hispanic whites and Native Americans than other groups. In response to this, several Native American tribes have filed lawsuits against the manufacturers and distributors of prescription opioids.
Where the opioid crisis has affected nonwhite communities, the response has often been slow and inadequate. In Puerto Rico, before Hurricane Maria, there were 600 fentanyl-related overdoses and 60 deaths in 2017. There are no official statistics for the time after that, but those who work with drug users say they have seen an increase in overdoses since the hurricane. Puerto Rico has not applied for federal funding to tackle the opioid crisis, nor has it passed a law to allow the administration of the lifesaving overdose drug naloxone by nonmedical personnel.",A heroin user displaying a needle in a South Bronx neighborhood in 2017.

SABRINA TAVERNISE,"The new rate puts the United States close to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, Mr. Frey said.
Population change is a major indicator of the demographic health of a country, and is made up of three flows births, deaths and immigrants. In the United States, an aging native population has been buoyed by new flows of immigrants, who in the past year made up about 48 percent of the total increase, Mr. Frey said.
Over the past 10 years in every area except North Dakota and Washington, D.C., the number of deaths came closer to the number of births, said Kenneth Johnson, a demographer from the University of New Hampshire. But for most states, immigration and domestic migration made up the difference, and so most saw their populations grow last year. Nevada, Idaho and Utah were the countrys fastest-growing in the year ended in July.
Meanwhile, populations declined in nine states: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, West Virginia and Wyoming. And Puerto Ricos population declined by about 4 percent, the bureau said, dragged down further by Hurricane Maria.
The drop is simply stunning, Professor Johnson said. Just 10 years ago, the surplus of births over deaths was 44 percent higher.
That pattern of rising deaths and declining births has taken hold in many parts of the United States and in areas with little immigration, like New England, leading to fewer students and schools, diminished economic vibrancy and strains on social services.",Not since the Great Depression when birthrates were down sharply has the population grown so slowly.

Steve Gorman,"(Reuters) - Federal emergency managers got an unusual head start preparing for Hurricane Lane, with key personnel and supplies deployed well ahead of the storm in response to a flurry of disaster threats to Hawaii in recent months, officials said on Thursday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had already established an operational presence on Oahu and Kauai after widespread flooding across those islands in April, and on Hawaii’s Big Island during the eruption of Kilauea Volcano that began in May. FEMA started moving additional supplies to Hawaii again in advance of Hurricane Hector, which skirted past the Pacific U.S. archipelago state more than a week ago, agency spokeswoman Veronica Verde told Reuters by phone from Honolulu. “We have already shipped meals-ready-to-eat, and also water and generators to all four (Hawaii) counties and prepositioned them for Hector” in distribution centers, with more provisions set to arrive ahead of Lane, she said. FEMA is also following a revised play book in the aftermath of catastrophic damage and loss of life wreaked by Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA chief Brock Long. The strategy calls for getting generators in place before the storm hits so they can immediately restore electricity for basic needs, including power to restart local water systems, Long told reporters at a briefing in Washington. “It’s not just providing food and water. If you fix the power first, you solve 90 percent of the problems,” Long said. Verde said FEMA has also “pushed more of our commodities forward in preparation for this hurricane” than it has in the past. FEMA was harshly criticized in the wake of Maria as having been too slow to recognize the gravity of the devastation to Puerto Rico and too sluggish in providing disaster relief to the Caribbean island. For Lane, which had threatened for days to become the first major hurricane to plow directly through the Hawaiian islands since 1992, FEMA “embedded” its own liaison officers in the emergency operations centers of state and local authorities for close coordination. FEMA has also sent in urban search-and-rescue teams, along with two disaster medical teams, personnel from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other specialists for transportation, communications and hazardous waste management, she said. In one other change since the Hurricane Maria calamity in Puerto Rico, Verde said FEMA has worked more closely with private-sector suppliers - such as big-box retail outlets - to arrange for emergency distribution of food, communications equipment and other provisions that might be needed.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"It took only an hour or two for President Trump’s attempt to downplay the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to be undercut by more accurate data. On Thursday, that effort looks even more starkly misguided with the release of new, much-higher estimates of mortality after the storm. In early October, though, Trump was almost celebratory. Sitting at a table with the island’s governor, he sought to demonstrate that he and his administration were prioritizing recovery efforts, using the failures of the George W. Bush administration on the Gulf Coast in 2005 as a counterpoint. “Every death is a horror,” Trump said. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like [Hurricane] Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering — nobody has ever seen anything like this.” He asked Gov. Ricardo Rosselló what the death toll was from Maria and was told that, at that moment, it was 16. “Sixteen people certified. Sixteen people versus in the thousands,” Trump crowed. “You can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.” By the time Trump got on Air Force One to head back to the mainland, that death toll had already been revised upward to 34. It kept trickling higher, eventually landing at 64. For Trump, the problem seems primarily to have been political. His administration, lauded for its handling of the storms that struck Texas and Florida, was being criticized for its slow response to the situation in Puerto Rico and its failure to be prepared for the storm in advance. By downplaying the death toll and, more specifically, by comparing it with the political gold standard in failed hurricane responses, Trump hoped to deflect that criticism. But even after the number of deaths was pegged at 64, it was widely understood that the figure was far too low. While determining the number of storm-related deaths concretely is often almost impossible for both practical and political reasons, it was obvious that the politically convenient double-digit numbers being used were wrong. Comparing annual mortality figures with the number of deaths reported after the storm, for example, showed a much bigger toll. The New York Times put the count at over 1,000 by the beginning of November — including an estimate of 556 deaths at the time of Trump’s visit. That would be nearly 35 times as many as Trump had insisted. On Thursday, the Times reported that the government of Puerto Rico would give a higher figure to Congress in a request for additional recovery funds. The new figure: 1,427. More than 22 times as many as the previous estimate. In that light, the comparison to Katrina looks far worse — as does Trump’s insistence that, on his watch, the government had avoided “the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died.” It’s worth noting that the new official estimate from Puerto Rico is substantially lower than an estimate determined by a survey on the island conducted by a research team from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Its estimate was that more than 4,600 people could have died after the storm, a total that makes Katrina pale in comparison. The Washington Post’s fact-checking team was quick to note that this figure was a significant outlier in estimates of the mortality rate and that the margin of error in the study was very, very large, swinging from about 800 to 8,500 deaths. The new figure of 1,427, though, is bad enough. Every death is, as the president said, a horror. What’s unclear now is how many of those deaths could have been prevented by better preparation or a more effective response. (After the storm hit, Trump blamed the “very big ocean” separating Puerto Rico from the continental United States for slowing relief efforts.) Comparisons to Katrina were inevitable with the newly released death toll, given how close the two figures are. But it’s Trump himself who set that disaster as the example to avoid. According to Trump’s own rhetoric, Maria was a “real catastrophe.”",Washington Post The revised death toll in Puerto Rico makes Trump's comparison to Katrina look even worse Washington Post It only took an hour or two for President Trump's attempt to downplay the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to be undercut …,2018-08-09T15:20:29Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",The revised death toll in Puerto Rico makes Trump's comparison to Katrina look even worse - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/09/the-revised-death-toll-in-puerto-rico-makes-trumps-comparison-to-katrina-look-even-worse/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KzhDPmP83NCSJZxfTPHPX4Ipr_g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LA5RP5MGDI43VEANL32OMRI7ME.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,Hurricane Maria,1
Laignee Barron,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it did not have a “phasing” plan in place for getting resources to Puerto Rico when Hurricane Maria devastated the island last September. Meanwhile the agency’s supply warehouse on Puerto Rico had zero cots, zero tarps and an almost negligible stockpile of food and water, its limited contents depleted during another storm two weeks earlier. In short, FEMA was badly underprepared for one of the worst disasters to strike Puerto Rico, the agency acknowledges in a new report assessing its response to the 2017 hurricane season. In quick succession, three major storms slammed into the United States in 2017, leading to “unprecedented” demands on the agency’s staffing, resources and budget. Nearly 4.8 million households impacted by the 2017 storm season and the California wildfires requested assistance from FEMA, more than the previous 10 years combined. Harvey, Irma and Maria were each among the five costliest hurricanes on record and collectively inflicted $265 billion in damages. Amid competing major disasters, the overstretched agency struggled to provide relief to storm victims, but drew particular criticism for its response in Puerto Rico. The agency’s report depicts a chaotic situation where incomplete planning “under-estimated the actual requirements” and led to “differences between the expected and actual impacts” on the ground. The agency said it was not prepared for Puerto Rico’s “insufficiently maintained infrastructure (e.g., the electrical grid),” and had not bargained on the local government’s cashflow problems. The report states that while the agency had committed to updating its Caribbean Response Plan before the 2017 season, the plan was incomplete by the time the hurricane hit, forcing the response operation to devise portions of the agenda on the fly. Plans also relied on a five-year-old earthquake and tsunami manual that had not anticipated a hurricane would affect the U.S. territory’s entire population of over 3 million. When Maria landed in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it knocked out electricity as well as most of the cellphone towers, rendering communication about who needed what, and where, almost impossible. Most of the agency’s logistical staff were already deployed to Florida and Texas, in response to hurricanes Irma and Harvey. To cope with shortages, FEMA said it promoting staffers into leadership positions that in some cases exceeded their abilities. Critics of FEMA’s response in Puerto Rico have alleged discrepancies between recovery efforts on the mainland versus the island territory. A Harvard study estimates there were as many as 4,600 deaths associated with Maria. FEMA’s report said the fatalities were being reviewed by Puerto Rico’s government. The White House has defended the federal response to Maria. President Donald Trump went so far as to say, “I’d say it was a 10” on a scale of 10. Ten months later, nearly 1,000 households in Puerto Rico still lack power, according to the New York Times, while thousands of islanders who took shelter on the mainland have been unable to return. FEMA’s report notes that a full recovery from 2017’s storms will take years.","When Hurricane Maria hit, more than 80% of Puerto Rico's supply warehouse was already depleted",2018-07-13T06:40:26Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",FEMA Says It Was Significantly Unprepared When Hurricane Maria Hit Puerto Rico,http://time.com/5337866/fema-report-unprepared-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gettyimages-858839814.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Maria,1
Greg Allen,"This photo taken last month in San Juan, Puerto Rico, shows roofs damaged by Hurricane Maria and the interior of buildings still exposed to the elements. Carlos Giusti/AP An international human rights group, Refugees International, has issued a scathing report on the U.S. response in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Maria. The group says ""poor coordination and logistics on the ground"" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Puerto Rican government ""seriously undermined the effectiveness of the aid delivery process."" Refugees International is an independent non-profit group that advocates on behalf of displaced people around the world. This was the first time the group had investigated a situation in the U.S. When its team arrived in Puerto Rico, more than two months after the storm, Refugees International says it was surprised that the relief effort was ""uncoordinated and poorly implemented."" The group says the poor response was ""prolonging the humanitarian emergency on the ground."" Puerto Rico was especially vulnerable to a disaster like a hurricane, the group says, because of its aging population, poorly maintained infrastructure and lack of emergency management assets, like helicopters and backup generators. ""In light of these known limitations,"" the report says, ""it is troubling that it took five days before any senior federal official from the U.S. mainland visited the island."" Comparing it with past natural disasters, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, the group found the U.S. response lacking. In Haiti, the group says 8,000 U.S. troops were deployed to the island within two days of the disaster. In Puerto Rico, it took 10 days for 4,500 U.S. troops to arrive. Central to FEMA's problematic response, Refugees International says, is that the federal agency is designed to supplement local and state disaster response efforts. But in Puerto Rico, the group found, municipalities and the Commonwealth had ""limited capacity and ability to respond."" Now that immediate needs like food and water are taken care of, the group says, Puerto Rico's greatest need is housing. Puerto Rico's government says more than 472,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged in Hurricane Maria. Months after the storm, Refugees International says, housing assistance provided by FEMA and the Puerto Rican government is not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Authorities have failed to distribute tarps and temporary roofs to all who need them, the group says. And the process for receiving assistance is complicated, confusing and poorly executed. Responding to the Refugees International report, FEMA agreed that coordination of efforts in disaster response is vital. But FEMA said Puerto Rico's devastation by the hurricane presented a difficult situation. ""More than 1,000 nautical miles from the mainland United States with an already fragile infrastructure and facing challenging economic circumstances presented communication and logistical challenges unique to the situation."" FEMA said: ""We regret the loss of life after any disaster and our thoughts and prayers are with the family members affected by the devastation of Hurricane Maria. FEMA continues to work every day to bring back a sense of normalcy to Puerto Rico.... ""Unity of effort is required for disaster response and recovery on any scale, but especially during this historic season. When emergency managers call for unity of effort, we mean that all levels of government, non-profit organizations, private sector businesses, and survivors must work together – each drawing upon their unique skills and capabilities – to meet the needs of disaster survivors."" Also Monday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello announced he was ordering a review of all deaths in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico's government has listed the official death toll from the hurricane at just 64. Independent reporting from journalists and statistical analyses with past years suggest that more than 1,000 deaths may have been due to Hurricane Maria. Rossello said by law in Puerto Rico, the cause of death must be certified by a doctor or coroner, something not always possible in the chaos after the storm. Rossello has ordered Puerto Rico's Demographic Registry and the Department of Public Safety to review all deaths to get ""the most accurate count and understanding of how people lost their lives to fully account for the impact of these storms."" The governor has also called for the creation of an expert panel to look at how deaths are certified and make suggestions on how to improve the process in the future.","Refugees International cites ""poor coordination and logistics on the ground.""

Adrian Florido,"A woman lights a candle inside a pair of shoes that were among hundreds displayed in memory of those killed by Hurricane Maria in front of the Puerto Rican Capitol, in San Juan in June. Ricardo Arduengo/AFP/Getty Images Independent researchers from the George Washington University have estimated that Hurricane Maria caused 2,975 deaths in Puerto Rico in the six months following the storm. The researchers' findings had been long-awaited. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello commissioned the independent study in February, after months of public pressure over his administration's failure to adequately count the number of hurricane dead. At the time, he said the research team would have the Puerto Rican government's full cooperation, including access to all mortality data. The new number represents a 22 percent increase over the number of deaths Puerto Rico would have expected had a hurricane not struck, researchers found. They also said those most at risk for death were poor people, and the elderly. ""The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island,"" Carlos Santos-Burgoa, the study's lead researcher, said in a statement. ""We hope this report and its recommendations will help build the island's resilience and pave the way toward a plan that will protect all sectors of society in times of natural disasters."" Since December, the government's official hurricane death toll has been stuck at 64, though the government has acknowledged that number was far too low and would be adjusted once the researchers had completed their study. It was unclear whether the island's government would adopt the researchers' estimate as its official toll. A spokesman for Gov. Rossello did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In addition to their new death count estimate, the researchers found that the Puerto Rican government did a poor job communicating with the public about the death count, and more broadly did not have an adequate disaster communications plan in place, which the researchers said contributed to public confusion.","The number comes from a study commissioned by Puerto Rico's government, and is much higher than the government's official death toll of 64.",2018-08-28T16:53:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Hurricane Maria Caused 2,975 Deaths In Puerto Rico, Independent Study Estimates",https://www.npr.org/2018/08/28/642615337/hurricane-maria-caused-2-975-deaths-in-puerto-rico-independent-study-estimates,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/28/gettyimages-965657412_wide-895ca9097df093aa8fd868c871c5656e2e810acb.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane Maria,1
Rayne Ellis,"Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control. But as communities in places like Texas and Puerto Rico are learning, disaster relief that only alleviates physical wants is not enough to put their communities back on their feet. After first responders have done their jobs to secure personal safety, an emotional recovery has to begin as well. Organizations like UNICEF are acknowledging that the damage to communities can last long after the repairs to homes are completed. Canned goods and other basic need items are given out in a disaster relief station in southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images “When the reality of the disaster sets in, the emotional and psychological responses that are seen community-wide are tremendous and overwhelming,” Center for School Behavioral Health director Janet Pozmantier said. “People simply don’t have the wherewithal to cope effectively.” That's where organizations like UNICEF are stepping in. Called psychosocial disaster relief, this kind of help comes in the weeks and months after a disaster in order to help people recover emotionally. If UNICEF can help it, these recovery efforts will be implemented after every storm. Psychosocial relief in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and Harvey are currently ongoing, and UNICEF knows that the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas will also require this kind of help in the near future. Other organizations like the Red Cross have also been championing psychological first aid measures for years, and with good reason. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century Research suggests that those who have survived catastrophe tend to start showing signs of trauma roughly three months after the event took place. Those signs can look like anything from anxiety and depression to constant irritability and anger or even complete dissociation and inattention in both children and adults. In order to combat these symptoms, Pozmantier and other staff at the center working under Mental Health America in Greater Houston developed free workshops to teach others how to effectively help people struggling in the aftermath of traumatic disaster-related events. Damaged furniture and personal belongings sit on a flooded curb in Southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images The workshop focuses on helping educators identify signs and symptoms of trauma in children while also including other useful tools like mindfulness training and how to self-regulate emotions. After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, UNICEF reached out to the center and offered to fund a Harvey-specific trauma training workshop, which the center named Hope for Harvey. In the months after Harvey made landfall in Texas, Pozmantier would drive through neighborhoods and see the entire contents of homes in a pile on the curb — family photos and clothing laying on top of piles of water damaged furniture — all ready to be collected by waste management. She said it was easy to understand why people would be traumatized. So when the center developed Hope for Harvey, aside from training people to deal with trauma in children, they also added some training on how to deal with adults. “Going through something like this, I realized more than ever that if we can take care of the adults, the kids are going to be okay for the most part too,” Pozmantier said. Nine months later, when UNICEF approached the center again to help Puerto Rico recover, the message was the same. The center developed a workshop, completely in Spanish, to help curb the emotional impact Hurricane Maria had on the people of Puerto Rico, focusing again on children — but also providing help to adults. First, UNICEF sent hygiene kits, water, and helped with shelter. But what UNICEF President Caryl Stern said she’s most proud of is the collaborative work that UNICEF and the Center for School Behavioral Health were able to put into action. A man and a child stand in front of a destoryed house in Puerto Rico a few days after Hurricane Maria hit the island. Image: unicef usa “Now classrooms are catastrophe stations the every time it rains in Puerto Rico. The children are worried that their home is destroyed. Or they’re wondering 'Is my mother okay?'” Stern said. Even seeing adults in distress can trigger the children, Stern said. Once Stern experienced this, she said she know that the training workshops would be incredibly important. In addition to the workshops, UNICEF sent a few hundred college students from State University of New York and City University of New York to pair up with member of various Puerto Rican communities to help rebuild the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico. Through this, people were able to come together and repair their communities themselves — something that can have a strong positive effect on the psyche. Stern says everyone who has ever dealt with disaster relief knows that the psychosocial recovery is the most import aspect of relief that is widely ignored by the public. Pozmantier agreed, adding that if she could, she would mandate that all educators go through training in mental health, trauma, mindfulness, and self-help strategies. “They are the first line of defense. It’s like any other kind of illness. You wouldn’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to try and strengthen your immune system,” Pozmantier said.","Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control.

Hilary Hanson,"Sunday’s Puppy Bowl XIV will include two extra special canine athletes. Every year, the event, which involves a bunch of adorable puppies frolicking around, serves as Animal Planet’s counter-programming to the Super Bowl. All of the participating dogs come from animal shelters or rescue groups, and this year, two of the puppies are animals rescued from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Kaleb Jr. and Archer, both mixed-breeds, were transported to the U.S. mainland by The Sato Project, a nonprofit focused on helping Puerto Rico’s stray dogs, ABC News reports. The Sato Project has sent puppies to the Puppy Bowl for the past seven years, but this year its participation takes on a new significance, as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the hurricane. As of Wednesday, nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority customers still had no power. “We’re hoping these little dogs on Sunday are going to fly the flag high and proud and people will once again start to realize that the crisis isn’t over there and we are a part of the USA,” Sato Project founder Chrissy Beckles told ABC 7. Kaleb Jr. and Archer have already been adopted by families in New York state, and both have been given new names — Murphy and Maddox, respectively, AM New York reports. They’re still called Kaleb Jr. and Archer in Puppy Bowl XIV promotional materials, though, so those are likely the names that will be used when the program airs. Both pups now appear to have great lives and loving homes, according to what their families told AM New York. Maddox, aka Archer, is a “super loving” puppy who enjoys belly rubs. And Murphy, aka Kaleb Jr., is a friendly, sociable dog whose hobbies include trying to sneak bites of steak and chasing a cat named Milton. The Sato Project still has other dogs available for adoption, though.

Jeffrey Sachs,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health, and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise. Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government's inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. Last month, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 deaths, with more likely to come in its aftermath. This past week Hurricane Michael has claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear. As the Earth warms due to the continued burning of coal, oil, and gas, climate-related disasters that include high-intensity hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, forest fires, and heat waves, pose rising dangers to life and property. Hurricanes become more destructive as warmer ocean waters feed more energy to the storms. Warmer air also carries more moisture for devastating rainfalls, while rising sea levels lead to more flooding. Yet Trump and his minions are the loyal servants of the fossil-fuel industry, which fill Republican party campaign coffers. Trump has also stalled the fight against climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. The politicians thereby deprive the people of their lives and property out of profound cynicism, greed, and willful scientific ignorance. The first job of government is to protect the public. Real protection requires climate action on several fronts: educating the public about the growing dire risks of human-induced climate change; enacting legislation and regulations to ensure that families and businesses are kept out of harm's way, for example by stopping construction in flood plains, and investing in sustainable infrastructure to counteract rising sea levels; anticipating the rising frequency of high-intensity climate-related disasters through science-based preparedness following through on properly scaled disaster-response during and after storm events; and most importantly for the future, spearheading the rapid transition to zero-carbon energy to prevent much greater calamities in the years ahead. This straightforward to-do list is the opposite of what Trump and his cronies are doing. Trump blithely disregards scientific findings about climate change and thereby exposes the nation to unprecedented risks. The officials he has appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant parts of government are industry cronies and lobbyists far more interested in self-enrichment, padding their accounts, and helping their once-and-future employers than in doing their current jobs. Trump's mishandling of last year's Puerto Rico disaster in the wake of Hurricane Maria is grounds itself for impeachment and trial. Thousands of citizens died unnecessarily on Trump's watch because the administration could not be stirred to proper action before, during, and after the hurricane. Two independent, detailed epidemiological studies, using different methodologies -- one led by researchers at Harvard University and the other by researchers at George Washington University -- have estimated that thousands died in the aftermath of Maria. While dozens died during the storm, thousands more died as a result of the residual effects of the storm. Maria downed electricity and wreaked havoc on the ability of Puerto Ricans to meet their life-sustaining needs by disrupting access to health services, safe water, and transportation. They died, in short, from the storm, and ultimately from inadequate disaster prevention, preparedness and response. Yet when the George Washington University study was released in September, the President responded by saying, ""I think we did a fantastic job"" in Puerto Rico. He brazenly denied the death count, without any attempt whatsoever to understand or learn from the findings. Recent scientific studies underscore the dire emergency ahead. Professor James Hansen, one of the world's leading climatologists, has demonstrated that the Earth's climate has moved above the temperature range that supported the entire 10,000 years of civilization. The risks of catastrophic sea level rise are upon us. A group of world-leading ecologists recently highlighted that critical Earth systems could spiral out of control. The Nobel-prize winning Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has also just released a harrowing report showing that the world has just a few years left to move decisively towards renewable energy if it hopes to achieve the globally agreed target to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature of the planet. The huge bills for Hurricanes Florence and Michael will now start rolling in: funerals, suffering, sorting through debris, and perhaps $30 billion in losses that could have been reduced dramatically through science-based planning and foresight. The American people are paying a heavy cost for the cynicism and cruelty of politicians in the pocket of the fossil-fuel industry. It is time to hold these reckless politicians to account.","Jeffrey Sachs writes President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Rick Scott, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity.

Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power company said it had restored power to over 1.1 million homes and businesses by Thursday morning after a transmission line failure cut service to almost all of the island’s 3.4 million residents the day before. The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, was working to restore power to the less than 30 percent of customers in the U.S. territory still without power after Wednesday morning’s blackout. The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico was the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the bankrupt, storm-ravaged power utility. The utility has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. PREPA said on Twitter that several power plants were back in service, including units at Central Aguirre, EcoElectrica, Central Costa Sur, Yabucoa and Palo Seco. The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230-kilovolt transmission line between the oil-fired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp’s ( AES.N ) coal-fired power plant in Guayama, PREPA said in a statement on Wednesday. PREPA estimated on Wednesday that it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore service to all customers that had power before Wednesday’s blackout. Before the outage, PREPA said 1.43 million homes and businesses had electric service. That is 97.2 percent of the utility's 1.47 million total customers. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s ) Many of the remaining 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria. PREPA has suffered several blackouts since the storm, including an outage last week affecting about 870,000 customers, and has been in bankruptcy since July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors.

"AJ Willingham, CNN","(CNN) To those who follow the NFL, the monstrous defensive powerhouse known as J.J. Watt needs no introduction. The Houston Texans star is one of the biggest names in the NFL. He works out a lot. He has strategically uncontroversial views on things like the #TakeAKnee movement. Even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin, he has stepped up time and time again to support his adoptive home of Houston. In short, he's basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football. Watt was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and played college football in the area, but has spent his whole professional career with the Houston Texans, who signed him in the first round of the 2011 draft. (Translation: he's good, he's rich and his team loves him.) He's a defensive end, which means he is both massive and athletic. The only place you don't want to meet a man like J.J. Watt is on the wrong end of the football field. In 2014, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract extension with the Texans. (Again: good, rich, loved.) In the last few years, Watt has suffered several major injuries, including a groin tear, a herniated disk and a leg fracture that have kept him off the field for prolonged periods of time. Nonetheless, his injuries didn't stop him from using his wealth and influence to pursue some serious do-goodery. His Hurricane Harvey heroism After Hurricane Harvey devastated areas around Houston and the rest of the Gulf Coast in August 2017, Watt embarked on what would be his most career-defining charitable effort to date. Through a YouCaring campaign and plenty of social media attention and help from some famous friends, Watt raised more than $37 million for victims of the floods and damage Harvey left behind. Because of his fundraising, he was awarded the 2017 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, which is given to honor the charity and volunteer efforts of NFL players. His previous work with shooting victims Oddly -- and sadly -- enough, Watt's offer to the Santa Fe HS shooting victims' families isn't the first time he has reached out after such a tragedy. After the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, Watt invited some of the children from Sandy Hook Elementary to meet him and participate in a day of football and much-needed fun at the Texans' stadium. His charity work and social views In addition to his support in times of tragedy, J.J. Watt is also the founder of the (aptly-named) J.J. Watt Foundation. The foundation funds after-school athletics programs and organizations several high-profile charity events a year. Watt's reputation as an all-American good guy exists during a time when the NFL is facing questions about what it means to be an American and, indeed, what it means to be a good guy. Watt has managed to stay at the margins of such controversies. During the #TakeAKnee movement, which headlined much of the 2017 season and intersected with Watt's Hurricane Harvey fundraising, Watt had this to say : "" I think that I can speak to what I've seen recently in the last month or so and the incredible nature of people coming together and the unity people showed in the midst of Hurricane Harvey, in the midst of Hurricane Irma, everybody in Puerto Rico helping out. It's incredible to see what people do when they come together for a common cause."" In the spirit of those comments, it should be noted that while Watt is an extraordinary force for good in the NFL and in the Houston community, he is far from the only athlete -- in Texas and in pro sports -- who donates their time, talent and fortune to others. During the same 2017 hurricane season that brought Harvey's wrath to Houston, several MLB players from Puerto Rico raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help out their homeland, which was crippled by Hurricane Maria. And in another meaningful moment of unity and support after the Santa Fe shooting, Texans players Julién Davenport and Kendall Lamm joined members of the Houston Police Department for their Saturday night patrol. Watt's latest offer of comfort to the Santa Fe HS families has netted him widespread support from fellow celebrities and athletes, and echoes a sentiment he tweeted out just days before the shooting. ""If you have the power to make someone happy, do it,"" he wrote. ""The world needs more of that.""","The Houston Texans player is basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football.",2018-05-21T17:15:21Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",NFL star helping out the Santa Fe victims' families has a long history of philanthropy,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/jj-watt-who-is-texans-nfl-santa-fe-victims-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170829034158-j-j-watt-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Maria,1
JEFFERY C. MAYS,"Earlier this month, top Republican donors, including Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, held a fund-raiser for Mr. Wofford. Mr. Greenberg, who paid a $9 million civil settlement for accounting fraud last year, is actively seeking to curtail the Martin Act. Just like Trump and congressional Republicans, Mr. Wofford wants to let Wall Street off scot-free, said Jack Sterne, a spokesman for Ms. James. Other issues facing Mr. Wofford should he win are potential conflicts of interest from his law practice. His firm has represented Purdue Pharma, a maker of opioids. Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood and Mr. Cuomo announced a lawsuit against the company in May over its marketing of the pain drug. Mr. Wofford was also the lawyer for Knighthead Capital Management, LLC, a hedge fund that was criticized for its handling of Puerto Ricos debt after Hurricane Maria. Mr. Cuomo has also threatened to sue the federal government over its response to the hurricane. Mr. Wofford said that he has never personally represented Purdue Pharma, and said he will sever all ties with his firm if elected. He has announced a plan that would use money from any opioids lawsuit settlements to fund addiction treatment. Mr. Wofford said the criticism about him is indicative of Ms. Jamess hyperpartisan attitude, and he sought to distinguish himself from her by characterizing himself as an outsider. Being on the wrong side of the tracks in Buffalo, Mr. Wofford said, is about as far from insider as you can get. His success as a lawyer, however, did allow him one heartfelt opportunity: In his fathers last years, Mr. Wofford returned to Buffalo, and during football season, they would bond again over Bills games but in person, at the stadium, as a season-ticket holder.","Keith H.

But Chris was expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday and head northeast toward Canada, prompting Canadian weather officials to also monitor the storm. “By late Tuesday it is forecast to attain hurricane status,” said a statement issued Monday by Environment Canada, that country’s official government weather service. “At this time it appears this storm could approach Nova Scotia by Thursday, likely weakening slightly as it does so.” Meanwhile the former Tropical Storm Beryl dissipated in the Caribbean Sea. The remnants of Beryl, which comprise an area of showers and thunderstorms, are forecast to pass over the Virgin Islands Monday and Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Monday night, bringing heavy rain to those areas. Beryl could make a comeback. According to the National Hurricane Center, the remains of Beryl have a 40 percent chance over the next five days of regenerating into a tropical cyclone as those remains are expected to turn northward over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. Beryl had been the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. It weakened from a tropical storm Sunday afternoon, no longer posing a threat to Florida or the continental United States. Beryl had been projected to follow a somewhat similar path as 2017’s Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, still was recovering from the devastation of Maria, which struck the island on Sept. 20 as Category 4 hurricane with maximum wind speeds of 155 mph. Maria also inflicted significant damage on Guadeloupe, Dominica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — all places expected to be drenched with rain by what remained of Beryl. Through Tuesday, what’s left of Beryl was forecast to dump 2 to 3 inches of rain on the Leeward Islands, which separate the northeastern Caribbean Sea from the western Atlantic Ocean and include Guadeloupe and Dominica. The same amount, 2 to 3 inches, also was expected to fall on the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with up to 5 inches possible in some areas. jcortega@sunsentinel.com, 561-243-6527 or Twitter @JuanSunSentinel","Sun Sentinel Tropical Storm Chris expected to become a hurricane; Former Beryl could make a comeback Sun Sentinel For a Monday in the usually quiet July, the tropics is an interesting place.

In calculating its records, NOAA compares years since 1980, when the agency began looking at the costs of disasters. Data on some disasters could also still be forthcoming, especially on the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, said Adam Smith, an economist at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. This is not that unusual. Data from damage due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was still pouring in several months after the storm.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive. As executive director of Refuge House, which works to end domestic violence in the Big Bend, she had to ensure her organization was ready for what she knew was coming: increased calls to their hotline, and a spike in urgent need for shelter from survivors and victims. Baldwins expectation didnt come out of nowhere. When disaster strikes, domestic violence followsnot just in Florida but around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The violence can take many forms, from child abuse to sexual violence to intimate partner violence. People like Baldwin have seen it all firsthand before. And with residents of the Panhandle still reeling from Michaels destruction, there are already signs that the cycle of violence could repeat itself. Weather events like these and disasters, in general, are opportunities for abusersboth domestic violence attackers and sexual assault perpetratorsto take advantage of the restrictive access survivors have to resources and to also take advantage of the isolation in the aftermath survivors experience, Baldwin told Earther. That isolation becomes even more intense and is even more of an opportunity for attackers to harm others. A considerable number of hotline calls came in before the storm in the eight northern Florida counties Refuge House serves, including hard-hit Wakulla and Gadsden counties, said Baldwin. People, largely women, were seeking immediate shelter (both from the storm and their abuser), and the Houses two emergency shelter locations were overcapacity by the time Hurricane Michael made landfall October 10 as a Category 4 storm. The shelters held more than 60 women between the two, compared with the usual 35 to 40, said Baldwin. A 20-person addition might not sound like a lot, but it is for this rural region. With the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. Escaping abusers is key during disasters because studies show that violence grows more severe in relationships that already experience it and its prevalence increases across the board, said Jennifer First, a mental health program manager at the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri whos done extensive research in this area. And one doesnt need to look far back in the history books for proof. Take Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in August 2017. The number of domestic violence victims who sought help between January and August from the Crisis Center at the Katy Christian Ministries, which serves the West Houston area, more than doubled from 417 in 2017 to 1,025 this year. Reports of sexual abuse the center received nearly tripled, according to a report the center released earlier this week. For Hurricane Maria, the deadliest storm in modern U.S. history, the situation didnt look much better. Lack of power threatened the elderly and sick who needed machines for their medicine, but this darkness also left abuse survivors and victims on the island vulnerable, as Refinery 29 reported. After the storm, local nonprofit ESCAPE saw requests for survivor-related services increase by 62 percent. A similar spike in domestic violence has been documented after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For some, this abuse can be deadly: Nearly half of all female homicide victims are killed by a current or former intimate partner, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly one in five women and about one in seven men report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime, per the CDC. Women of color are especially at risk. Why? A lot of the data points to stress. She may have fewer housing choices, First said. She may have less social support. These are all risks that are often associated with domestic violence. After disasters like hurricanes strike, communities are more likely to experience employment loss, displacement, loss of housing, and financial issues. All this is especially true for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods already experiencing these inequalities. (Michael struck the states poorest region.) Even without a natural disaster, economic and housing challenges can increase the risk of domestic violence, First said. Throw a hurricane into the mix, and chaos can ensue. These communities and these families and these survivors were already very stressed before the storm arrived, said Baldwin from Refuge House to Earther. People are really living day to day, on the edge of being able to meet their basic needs, and thats a normal day. So with the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. States like New Jersey and Missouri have begun addressing the spike in domestic violence that accompanies natural disasters through training to emergency response teams and increased funding to domestic violence victims, but more needs to happenespecially in coastal communities in the South that deal with these hurricanes the most, said First. At least in the part of Florida Baldwin serves, her team at Refuge House goes door to door with relief agencies. The state brings the food and water, and Refuge House brings the counseling and comfort victims may seek during this tumultuous time. Theyve been doing this for the last 10 years and remain on the ground in wake of Hurricane Michael. While victims and survivors needed immediate shelter at first, in the weeks and months to come they may need help finding permanent housing or protection from an abuser. As the data shows us, the danger can last long after a storm passes. These coming weeks are just the beginning.","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities. The latest areas under scrutiny are Superfund sites, whose toxic pollutants can be spread far and wide by floodwaters.
 Currently on the radar for federal and state officials are seven Superfund sites and a landfill across Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri, states that are still experiencing some minor to major flooding as of Thursday. These are some of the most contaminated sites in the U.S., and when floodwaters hit them, they can become major threats to human and environmental health if their pollutants travel off site, as was seen in Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
Superfund sites contain some of the most dangerous chemicals known to humankind, Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists Center for Science and Democracy, told Earther.
Thats why the Environmental Protection Agency is nowmonitoring a bunch of Superfund sites closely, although so far, it seems to think all of them are doing okay.
The EPA has taken action on two Superfunds in particular, it announced Tuesday: Nebraska Ordnance Plant, a former munitions production plant in Mead, Nebraska, and Conservation Chemical Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri, which used to store chemicals. The agency hasnt spotted any contaminant releases at either, but floodwaters did hit them hard.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
The EPA told Earther italso flagged another two sites in Iowa with water on the property that didnt require actionthe Railroad Avenue Groundwater Contamination Site in West Des Moines and the Mid-America Tanning Company Site near Sergeant Bluff. The Lawrence Todtz Farm Site in Iowawasnt flooded, but its been made inaccessible due to the flooding, so the EPA is also monitoring it. And the EPA, in coordination with state environmental agencies, is keeping tabs on another two Superfund sites in Nebraskawhere the flooding has paused clean up activities, as well as a landfill in the City of St. Joseph in Missouri that isnt a Superfund. 
The Nebraska Ordnance Plant, which sits in the states still slightly-flooded southeast corner, has its soil and groundwater contaminated with potentially carcinogenic substances like trichloroethene (or TCE), as well as explosives. The facility saw its groundwater treatment plant and extraction wells, which help remove the TCE, temporarily shut down because authorities couldnt access them and to avoid any treated water from mixing with the floodwaters. They are all back up and running now.
This is only one of the facilities the state of Nebraska is monitoring. Others will still require close attention as the floodwaters recedeespecially if anything strange turns up in the states drinking water.
Right now, a combination of flood waters and damaged roads are keeping responders from a few of Nebraska Superfund Sites for inspection. Those sites have not been fully evaluated yet, Amanda Woita, a public information officer with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), told Earther in an email. DEQs primary responsibility is protecting public health. That includes testing drinking water and assessing other important infrastructure, such as community drinking water wells and sewage treatment plants. The department is in that phase right now. 
Back in Missouri, the Conservation Chemical Corporations soil and groundwater are also contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals like benzene and TCE. The site experienced flooding, but the EPA reports that it didnt stop its clean-up operations in response. Instead, more groundwater was extracted to help keep pace with the floodwaters. 
Half of Missouris St. Joseph City Landfill has become flooded, according to Brian Quinn, the information officer for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. He told Earther in an email that the non-hazardous landfill was last inspected in January 2018, and the department will conduct another investigation once the waters recede to make sure the asphalt and soil cap covering the garbage is still in place.
All in all, the EPA hasnt issued any public health alerts or advisories in wake of these floods, the agency told Earther. But there could still be trouble as the floodwaters migrate farther down the Mississippi River in Missouri. John Hickey, the executive director of the states Sierra Club chapter, is worried that the many coal ash disposal sites in the eastern portion of the state along the Mississippi could pose a threat if floodwaters breach them. Coal ash landfills and ponds often contain heavy metals like lead and mercury, which are hazardous to human health. Similar flooding concerns were raised in North Carolina in wake of Hurricane Florence last year. 
 But the Superfund sites that have already experienced flooding worry Hickey, too.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river, Hickey told Earther. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
Americans experienced that reality firsthand in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey damaged 13 Superfund sites in Texas, leading to mass contamination from one site alone. It took the EPA eight months to begin cleaning up that site, the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, and cleanup is slated to go on another year or more. Then, there was Hurricane Maria, which flooded a lead-contaminated Superfund in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, leaving residents worried about contamination long after the natural disaster.

As Carter noted, low-income communities and people of color tend to be closest to these facilities, so theyre the most at risk. 
These are some of the most disenfranchised communities in the United States, he told Earther. [They] dont have a ton of power in the United States, and they will be the ones impacted by this flooding at Superfund sites.
The EPA is well aware of the threat that floodingwhich is set to intensify in the Midwest in a warmer worldposes to these sites. Its Climate Adaptation Plan published in 2014 makes this clear: Inundation and flooding may lead to transport of contaminants through surface soils, ground water, surface waters, and/or coastal waters. 
Former President Barack Obama issued an executive order that wouldve required all federal departments, including those that manage Superfunds, prepare for future flood risks. President Donald Trump, predictably, rescinded it. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations spring flood outlook, heavier than usual rainfall is set to bring historic, widespread flooding to the Midwest through May.
Whether or not the latest bout of floods caused any Superfund sites to spread their contaminants, it seems clear these sites will only become more vulnerable. We better ready up.
Correction: An earlier version of this post indicated that eight Superfund sites have dealt with floodwaters. One of those sites, a landfill, is not actually a Superfund. The text and headline have been updated accordingly. We have also updated to clarify that the Nebraska Ordnance Plant was shut down to avoid treated water from mixing with floodwaters in addition to access issues.","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities.

We asked ”Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to share his thoughts on why this is important. Read his story below, and donate now at g.co/supportPR. Puerto Rico is 35 by 100 miles—an archipelago with a main island and two adjacent island-municipalities, Culebra and Vieques. But this tiny paradise has made an outsized impression on the world stage...artists…musicians…major league shortstops…and five Miss Universes. A territory of the United States since 1898, Puerto Ricans, by birth, are U.S. citizens. Right now, there are more Puerto Ricans in the continental United States (over 4.5 million) than on the island, 3.3 million. It’s not surprising that when the island is in trouble, the diaspora says, “presente.” Puerto Rico is my second home. It’s where my parents were born. My mom lived there until she was a toddler, and my dad grew up there until he was about 18 and came to New York for graduate school. I had the incredible privilege and good fortune of having them send me to Puerto Rico every summer. My sister and I lived with my grandparents in Vega Alta, a humble town on the northern coast of the island. I used to work at my aunt’s school supply store on the frozen slushie machine. And Puerto Rico is where Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017—the largest hurricane to hit the Caribbean in modern history. The devastation was widespread: most estimates put the damage costs at over $90 billion, the third most costly hurricane ever. In less than 48 hours, 80 percent of Puerto Rico’s agriculture was destroyed and 85 percent of above-ground telephone and internet cables were knocked out. After Maria made landfall, there was a terrible silence from the island that lasted for days. We looked for any news or pictures on social media. We texted over and over again, hoping our loved ones could find a way to get a message through. For me, it was five days until we heard from any family members; we found a picture of our uncle helping in a supply line in Vega Alta. Never before has a hurricane done this much damage to the island—to its already fragile power grid, to the way of life, to the land itself. I’ll never forget when we flew to Puerto Rico a month after Maria; seeing bare mountains for the first time was terrifying. Nature is already making a comeback—those islands that were brown in the wake of Maria are green again. But due to the unpreparedness for this crisis and the halting attempts to restore power, Puerto Ricans in many parts of the island are still struggling. Power is still not fully restored. And this year’s hurricane season has just begun. In the nine months since Hurricane Maria, people all over the world have opened their piggy banks and opened their hearts to help. Across the country, many have made their voices heard, demanding action from Congress. It has meant so much. Progress has been made, but there is still work to be done. Now I ask that you join us once again in supporting economic recovery efforts on the island. Google will be matching donations up to $2 million to the Hispanic Federation and Mercy Corps—two organizations that have been helping people on the ground throughout the relief effort.

Cory Doctorow,"According to the Trump administration, Hurricane Maria killed 64 people; according to a careful, peer-reviewed study in the New England Journal of Medicine, the death toll was 4645. The researchers used ""a representative, stratified sample"" of 3299 Puerto Rican households to estimate the likelihood of a death occurring in the absence of Maria and then used the actual deaths that occurred to compute the excess mortality. The Trump administration arrived at its estimate by distributing paper towel rolls, guessing at how many would be needed to clean up after a tragic death, and then counting how many rolls were actually used. Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria. Our estimate of 4645 excess deaths from September 20 through December 31, 2017, is likely to be conservative since subsequent adjustments for survivor bias and household-size distributions increase this estimate to more than 5000. These adjustments represent one simple way to account for biases, but we have made our data publicly available for additional analyses. Our estimates are roughly consistent with press reports that evaluated deaths in the first month after the hurricane.8,29-33 Our estimates also indicate that mortality rates stayed high throughout the rest of the year. These numbers will serve as an important independent comparison to official statistics from death-registry data, which are currently being reevaluated,13,34 and underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico.

Luis Valentin Ortiz,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A year after Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico with 150 mile-per-hour (241 kph) winds, government officials on Thursday announced that about $1.5 billion in federal funds aimed primarily at rebuilding housing will start flowing to the island. “One year (after the event) is quite good for what we generally do,” U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson said. HUD allocated the funds in February. An additional $18.5 billion for the island was approved by the federal agency in March, but the process to disburse this allocation has yet to finish. “It’s a day of solace. It’s a day of remembrance,” said Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, adding: “we can honor victims” by rebuilding stronger and more resilient infrastructure. Rossello and Carson announced the funding ahead of a planned memorial event: “One Year After Maria” with religious and civic leaders as well as local and federal officials. Maria devastated the U.S. commonwealth, and Rossello has said the island’s government initially underestimated the death toll, putting it at 64. In August, a study by George Washington University lifted that to nearly 3,000. Shuttered businesses, blue tarp roofs and extensively damaged homes can still be seen throughout Puerto Rico and access to electricity and fresh water remain spotty. U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to accept the higher death estimate, and continues to joust with many local officials and critics who blasted the federal response to the storm. Trump has called his administration’s emergency response to Maria an “unsung success” and “one of the best jobs that’s ever been done.” “If he calls a success or an unsung success 3,000 people dying by his watch, definitely he doesn’t know what success is,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a Trump critic, told Reuters during a recent interview. Trump has said “3000 people did not die” following Hurricane Maria, disputing the George Washington study estimating the storm killed 2,975 people directly or indirectly from September 2017 through mid-February. The exact toll is unknown. ALLOCATION Carson, asked about the federal response to Maria, told Reuters the government “responded quickly,” yet conceded “there were things that could have been better.” He said the “real issue” is rebuilding and giving Puerto Rico a more resilient infrastructure, steps that are “a lot more productive than arguing about the number” of dead. HUD’s allocation will mostly be used to fix homes; help residents obtain title deeds needed to qualify for federal aid; and to relocate at-risk communities, the governor said. For Carson, the disbursement of HUD funds “paves the way for a speedy, long-term recovery,” but he warned that the “path forward is challenging, and will be measured not in months, but rather in years.” The storm knocked out power and communications to virtually all of island’s 3.2 million residents, while destroying the homes of thousands. Even before the Category-4 storm hit, Puerto Rico was financially bankrupt with $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities it cannot pay. A year after Maria, the island is far from prepared for the next big storm, with an ever-fragile power grid, damaged infrastructure and the same crippling debt. BRACING More than 200,000 people left the island after the storm, mostly to the U.S. mainland, according to government data. There are still some 45,000 homes with so-called “blue roofs,” or tarps installed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The San Juan mayor has noted that the island has seen only a fraction of almost $50 billion in recovery funds Congress approved, including the $20 billion in HUD funds. “Most of the people that have requested help from FEMA... have not received enough assistance to be able to take care of their problems,” Mayor Cruz said, adding that “a lot of people that don’t have a title deed and they really are not eligible to receive any type of support or help.” The recovery process has also seen hundreds of community-driven efforts. During a forum held on Wednesday by the nonprofit Center for Investigative Journalism, community leaders urged for a multisectoral approach to the recovery, rather than a government-only-led effort, which has proven slow and full of missteps. “We lost people, roofs and houses, but our community worked hard to get back on its feet,” said Wilfredo Lopez, a community leader of the Sonadora neighborhood in Aguas Buenas, which had disaster-trained residents and its own protocols in place before the storm hit.

Merrit Kennedy,"The active part of the landfill in Toa Baja is currently a hot, rancid, open dump. Federal regulations require trash piles to be covered daily with earth. But the site's supervisor says that's currently impossible. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR Outside Puerto Rico's capital, a three-story-high mountain of debris and waste sits smack in the middle of what was a suburban soccer field before Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Blue bleachers peek out from the edge of the trash pile, as a line of trucks rolls in to dump even more tree branches and moldy furniture. Workmen wearing yellow hard hats operate diggers to add the new waste to the growing pile in the center of the field. Puerto Rico is struggling under the weight of its own garbage. Even before Maria hit two and a half months ago, the Environmental Protection Agency says most of the island's landfills were filled beyond capacity and that nearly half were under orders to close. Puerto Rico's Solid Waste Authority estimates that the powerful hurricane created 6.2 million cubic yards of waste and debris — and it needs to go somewhere. That's enough trash to fill about 43 football stadiums with piles of waste eights stories high, according to a measure used by FEMA. And it has to go somewhere. Workmen at the soccer field say the site became a makeshift dump because the landfill for the Toa Baja municipality, near San Juan, is so flooded with trash that wait times can be hours. When the soccer site becomes too full, the workers say waste is then moved to the landfill in dump trucks. In Maria's wake, local governments are supposed to separate tree branches and other ""green waste"" for composting so that it doesn't clog up landfills, says Antonio Rios, the head of Puerto Rico's Solid Waste Management Authority, the agency that sets the U.S. territory's waste policy. That composting process isn't happening everywhere, Rios acknowledges. Green debris is still winding up in overflowing landfills across the island, though he says authorities are trying to divert additional material to landfills that have more room. Rios points out that the hurricane has created other types of waste, things like broken kitchen appliances and food that went rotten because of a lack of electricity. The landfill in Toa Baja is managed by the private firm Conwaste and takes in trash from at least four municipalities. It has been deeply troubled for years. The site is supervised by 25-year-old Lionel Ruiz. Last month, he says, they accepted 36,000 tons of waste — that's 70 percent more than the month before the hurricane. Ruiz points to trash-filled trucks waiting in a line that stretches down a dirt road and off into the distance. ""It's more busy than usual,"" Ruiz says. ""You see the line? We never have that line in normal operation."" In 2008, the EPA ordered the Toa Baja landfill to close by 2014 because it posed an ""imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment."" Heaps of tree branches, moldy furniture and other debris from Hurricane Maria piles up at a former soccer field now being used as a dumping site in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Most of the island's landfills were already over capacity before the storm devastated the island in September. José Jiménez-Tirado for NPR The EPA said environmental inspectors found evidence that the landfill did not have a system to control liquid seeping through the garbage pile and into the ground. The agency found that this substance, called leachate, could potentially contaminate a nearby aquifer and wetlands. In 2012, the EPA allowed the landfill to push back the closure for an unspecified amount of time. The landfill was allowed to create a new, smaller area that used more environmental precautions — such as a lining to prevent seepage — and start accepting waste there. The story is much the same across the lush tropical island of Puerto Rico. The EPA got directly involved in the island's landfills in 2002, and has since ordered at least 12 of the approximately 29 landfills to close, which can be a years-long process. It's not immediately clear how many sites — most of which are already at capacity — have actually shut down. Rios of the Solid Waste Authority estimates that at current recycling rates, all of the island's landfills will be full in 20 to 25 years. Even the newly added space in Toa Baja's landfill is rapidly filling up, Ruiz says. Before the hurricane hit, he said he thought it would take five years for that area to fill up; Maria has sped up the timeline. He's grappling with immediate problems. Birds and insects circle around what is currently a hot, rancid, open dump. ""This is the active area of the landfill, you will see a lot of uncovered material,"" Ruiz says. Workers would normally cover the expansive mess with earth every day to comply with federal regulations, but he says they haven't been able to do so for a week because the private trucks they use are now being used by FEMA. The uncovered mounds of rotting garbage is upsetting to people down the hill in the neighborhood of Candelaria, people like 83-year-old Angelo Fernandez. ""The smell, the stink!"" he says, totally exasperated. ""Every time they leave it open, the smell is awful."" In his 41 years living here, he's seen mountains of trash rise from the ground, parts of which are now covered with dirt and vegetation. But the waste lies just inches under the surface. ""It is getting bigger, it is getting bigger and bigger — that was never this height — never,"" Fernandez says. ""All that mountain you see there is garbage!"" He says people living in Candelaria suffer from asthma and other breathing problems because of the landfill. They cough a lot. Actually closing a landfill is expensive, costing approximately $200,000 per acre, according to Rios. Puerto Rico is struggling with more than $120 billion in debt and pension obligations, and has filed for a bankruptcy-like procedure — and that was before the hurricane. The EPA has acknowledged that the budget crisis is making it more difficult for local governments on the island to handle the garbage problem. The municipalities ""have always had limited funds to implement the environmental and engineering controls required to improve, and ultimately close, the landfills,"" the agency says. And Puerto Rico's Environmental Quality Board hasn't required municipalities to set money aside in case their landfills needed to close. Another issue, Rios says, is that some of the landfills now under closure orders aren't charging garbage trucks high enough fees to generate the money to actually shut down. Ultimately, the troubled landfill system is ""a public health issue and it's about to collapse really soon,"" says Agustin Carbo, former head of the Solid Waste Authority. He says Puerto Rico also needs to think beyond landfills rather than just open new ones. Recycling rates on the island are about half of what they are on the U.S. mainland. ""We need to look for different alternatives,"" he says, particularly because Puerto Rico has limited space. That might include a number of other waste management techniques such as ""waste-to-energy,"" which uses methods like incineration to produce electricity and heat. Most importantly, he says, ""people need to change their behavior and it's quite complex, how you change that in a small island. But it can be done — it just, people need to understand what's at stake here."" Those stakes are clear to Fernandez, who lives next to the landfill. He says that if it closed for good, ""I think it would be a better place to live. I know it would be.""","Even before Maria hit, most of the island's landfills were filled beyond capacity and nearly half had EPA closure orders.

Employees were not informed of the closings ahead of time. Three of these stores are in Puerto Rico. Walmart has dealt a massive blow to its Puerto Rican employees after closing three of its Sam's Club stores without warning. In total, the retailer will be closing 63 stores across the US. Employees of its Bayamón and Barceloneta stores turned up to work today to find a sign saying, ""This Club will remain closed today,"" Caribbean Business reported.

ABC News,"Eight months after being struck by Hurricane Maria, the island of Puerto Rico is bracing as another hurricane season while still cleaning up and restoring power. Interested in Puerto Rico? Add Puerto Rico as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Puerto Rico news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season will see five to nine hurricanes with one to four major ones. Officials on the island are making every effort to be prepared ahead of any storm by holding table-top drills, mock exercises and rounds of meetings. Deteriorated U.S. and Puerto Rico flags fly on a roof eight months after the passing of Hurricane Maria in the Barrio Jacana Piedra Blanca area of Yabucoa, May 16, 2018. These are some of the challenges the island faces going into hurricane season: THE RACE TO 100% The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is racing to get the island’s customers back on the electrical grid before the start of hurricane season. Approximately 13,000 customers are still without power more than 240 days since Hurricane Maria hit the island. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which was working on grid restoration, said their restoration mission assignment ended May 18. “USACE staff are currently supporting the transfer of logistics operations back to FEMA and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and are overseeing the demobilization of contractors that supported the transmission and distribution lines mission” an Army Corps of Engineers spokesperson said in a statement to ABC News. A home in the Barrio Jacana Piedra Blanca still has a temporary canvas roof cover eight months after Hurricane Maria, in Yabucoa, a town where many residents continue without power in Puerto Rico, May 16, 2018. Col. Jason Kirk, the commander of the Task Force Power Restoration, told ABC News in March that the work being done was mainly a temporary one. ""The power restoration that we're doing right now, for the most part, is replacement... if we were in the mission to bury them [electrical poles], we would have hundreds of thousands of people without power because it takes so long,"" Kirk said. Gov. Ricardo Rossello has said that the electrical grid that is being put up now will be weaker than the grid that existed prior to Maria. He added that it will take close to five years to a rebuild a stronger electrical grid. THE DEATH TOLL The number of lives claimed following Hurricane Maria remains a mystery on the island. A team from George Washington University is currently leading an independent effort to count the dead. Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health, told ABC News the task of counting the deaths is an exhausting one, which involves interviewing people involved in the care of those who passed away. In a statement on Monday, the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety has announced that the George Washington University team “requested additional time to complete the commissioned study on the deaths after the passage of Hurricane Maria through the Island.” The statement continued by saying “according to Professor Carlos Santos Burgoa, director of the study, the final report may be completed during this summer to complete the analysis of the available databases.” An electric power pole leans over the road in the Piedra Blanca area of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, May 16, 2018. There was a spike in the mortality rate in the months after Hurricane Maria. According to a professor of applied demography at Pennsylvania State University who has studied the daily mortality data from the Puerto Rico government, says there were approximately 1,000 more deaths on the island in the month after Maria. At the press conference announcing GWU as the lead team in February, however, Rossello said: “It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” THE NEXT GENERATION What happens to the population’s youngest is key to the long term development and reconstruction on the island. The number of Puerto Ricans that have left the island has been swirling since the hurricane hit with the number believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. The Puerto Rico Department of Education told ABC News in recent weeks that 283 schools are slated to close because of declining student enrollment following Hurricane Maria. A spokesperson for the department says there are 319,000 students on the island compared to 346,000 enrolled students as of May 2017. The department projects that there will be 311,000 enrolled students this August. Half of schools on the island are at 60 percent of capacity.","Eight months after being struck by Hurricane Maria, the island of Puerto Rico is bracing as another hurricane season while still cleaning up and restoring power.",2018-05-26T21:13:19Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Puerto Rico braces for hurricane season, 8 months after Maria",https://abcnews.go.com/US/puerto-rico-braces-hurricane-season-months-maria/story?id=55459988,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/puerto-rico-hurricane-season-02-ap-mt-180526_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Maria,1
Mark Kaufman,"There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins. But following the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 hurricane season, a group of scientists at Princeton University's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory have identified a connection between the six major hurricanes with winds over 110 mph that churned in the ocean, three of which pummeled the U.S. All were supercharged by unusually warm waters, and these warm conditions outweighed other weather factors. This research published on Thursday in the journal Science has significant climate change implications, as the world is expected to continue its accelerating warming trend. Hurricane Irma on Sept. 8, 2017. Image: nasa Critically, over 90 percent of the accumulating heat on Earth is absorbed by the planet's oceans. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" NASA oceanographer Josh Willis said. Hurricanes feed off warm waters. It's their fuel. But still, warm waters alone don't stoke hurricanes. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence To pinpoint the factors that drove the 2017 hurricane season, the Princeton scientists used a sophisticated climate computing model to simulate the different wide-scale weather conditions on Earth. This is no easy task. Any hurricane season has a number of influences that may propel, or dampen, the storm season or any particular storm. ""It's quite complicated, theres many moving parts,"" Colin Zarzycki, a storm scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""It's not just ocean temperature. It's kind of a big tangled web."" Hurricane Harvey as seen from the International Space Station in August 2017. Image: nasa But even so, after simulating different weather conditions, it became clear that other major climate factors like cooling in the Pacific waters were overpowered by the effects of the unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. The increase in 2017 hurricanes was caused ""mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic,"" the researchers wrote. But there was another critical factor driving these storms. ""The key point is that the Atlantic was warmer than other open oceans all over the world,"" the study's lead author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said in an interview. This caused more warm air to rise up into the sky over the Atlantic, making the atmosphere more unstable and ripe for tumultuous storm activity. In short, the Atlantic ocean got an ""extra kick"" from all this rising motion, Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane scientist at Florida International University, said over email. ""As a result, thunderstorms that feed hurricanes become stronger,"" said Willoughby. Hurricanes Maria and Jose in September 2017. Image: nasa The power of warm waters The Atlantic wasn't just warm it was much warmer than Earth's other oceans. But regardless, just having unusually warm waters in the Atlantic is still going to fuel powerful storms. ""When you get an ocean basin that gets warm like that, it really primes the atmosphere to be conducive to these strong storms,"" said Zarzycki. ""When you boil it down, with warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures, under ideal conditions we would expect storms to be stronger."" That said, Zarzycki underscores that other weather factors like strong wind shear that pummels and weakens hurricanes can weaken or tear apart any storm. But without these weakening factors, hurricanes can really ignite as they did in 2017. Going forward, what might this all mean for the future storm activity? Should we expect more major hurricanes? In future decades, perhaps by 2080, warming oceans may boost the count of major storms in the Atlantic during a busy season from six to eight, said Murakami. This means more opportunities for giant storms to hit the U.S. coast. But in the next 10 years, he can't say if warmer oceans might generate more major hurricanes. Weather patterns, or natural variability, are just too unpredictable. Hurricane Maria passing over Puerto Rico. Image: nasa ""It remains uncertain as to whether we will see more frequent active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the upcoming decade due to the dominant influence of natural variability,"" Murakami said. For example, there's a major climate trend running on 30-year timescales called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, that can warm or cool vast swaths of the Atlantic, said Willoughby. Saharan dust from Africa also blows over the ocean, which can cool the waters, he said. And there are major influences from the Pacific Ocean that can drive down wind shear in the Atlantic. ""All of these well-established oceanic vacillations make it harder to define the long-term warming caused by us humans,"" said Willoughby. So, it's complicated. But one thing is much more certain: Warm oceans fueled the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 season. And overall, we can expect more warm water.","There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins.

Luis Valentin Ortiz,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Shuttered businesses, blue tarp roofs and extensively damaged homes can still be seen throughout Puerto Rico a year after Hurricane Maria ripped through the island with 150 mile-per-hour winds, and access to electricity and fresh water remain spotty. Last month, the U.S. Commonwealth’s government sharply raised the official estimate of Maria’s death toll to almost 3,000 after an independent study. The exact death toll figure remains unknown, and the governor has admitted his administration failed to properly record storm-related deaths. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to accept the new number, and continues to joust with many local officials and other critics who complain that the federal response to the storm was inadequate. “Today is a day to remember those who are not physically with us, but left a significant mark after their departure. Hurricane Maria took with it many lives that we will not overlook and that we still remember with a great weight of pain,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said Thursday ahead of a planned memorial event: “One Year After Maria” with religious leaders and government officials. U.S. Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson was also on the island, where he was expected to give an update on his agency response efforts to Hurricane Maria. The storm knocked out power and communications to virtually all of Puerto Rico’s 3.2 million residents, while destroying the homes of thousands. Even before the Category-4 storm hit, Puerto Rico was financially bankrupt with $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities it cannot pay. A year after Maria, the island is far from prepared for the next big storm, with an ever-fragile power grid, damaged infrastructure and the same crippling debt. The island’s government initially put the death toll at 64, but the August study by George Washington University estimated that Maria killed 2,975 people either directly or indirectly from the time it struck in September 2017 to mid-February. Trump has described his administration’s response to the disaster as an “unsung success” and “one of the best jobs that’s ever been done.” He further said that “3000 people did not die” following Hurricane Maria. “If he calls a success or an unsung success 3,000 people dying by his watch, definitely he doesn’t know what success is,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal Trump critic, told Reuters during a recent interview. BRACING More than 200,000 people left the island after the storm, mostly to the U.S. mainland, according to government data. There are still some 45,000 homes with so-called “blue roofs,” or tarps installed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The San Juan mayor has noted that the island has seen only a fraction of almost $50 billion in recovery funds Congress approved for Puerto Rico, including $20 billion in HUD funds. “Most of the people that have requested help from FEMA... have not received enough assistance to be able to take care of their problems,” Mayor Cruz said, adding that “a lot of people that don’t have a title deed and they really are not eligible to receive any type of support or help.” The recovery process after Maria has also seen hundreds of community-driven efforts. During a forum held on Wednesday by the nonprofit Center for Investigative Journalism, community leaders urged for a multisectoral approach to the recovery, rather than a government-only-led effort, which has proven slow and full of missteps. “We lost people, roofs and houses, but our community worked hard to get back on its feet,” said Wilfredo Lopez, a community leader of the Sonadora neighborhood in Aguas Buenas, which had disaster-trained residents and its own protocols in place before the storm hit.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Photo Credit Sally Deng It’s been 12 weeks and counting, and Puerto Rico still flounders in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, left to beg for federal help. The politics and indifference underlying the island’s desperation recall the lyrics of Stephen Sondheim 60 years ago in “West Side Story”: Nobody knows in America Puerto Rico’s in America! The plot of that Broadway musical was rooted in the great migration in the 1950s as Puerto Ricans — American citizens in good standing — fled hardship on their beloved commonwealth island for fresh opportunity and better government benefits in mainland states. A similar diaspora occurred during the recent recessio n, when 400,000 migrated. And now, thousands upon thousands more have been leaving each week as the island staggers. Florida alone has received more than 230,000 Puerto Ricans since the Sept. 20 hurricane, and experts predict that the outflow to places like New York and Pennsylvania could increase by more than 300,000 in the next two years unless a radical rebuilding takes place for Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents. The Trump recovery imprint has been far clearer in Gulf Coast states hit by hurricanes this year than on an island that has so little political clout. A double standard in the law was quickly clear after the storm when a federal cap on Puerto Rico’s food stamps limited the amount of emergency food aid. Texas and Florida had no such restraints after their hurricanes. As of last week, only about 60 percent of Puerto Rico’s power had been restored. Power remains the key to ever regaining normalcy in business, education and home life. But the island is suffering the longest blackout in United States history. An estimated 700 temporary generators are providing emergency power, with officials hoping for something more permanent no earlier than next summer. The island was reeling under $74 billion in debt even before the hurricane hit, and its news tends to get worse, not better. Its government counted a death toll of 64 in the first 42 days after the storm, but a detailed survey by The Times found that 1,052 more people than usual had died. More lives are at risk now, with older residents and those with chronic health conditions particularly threatened as the on-again-off-again power grid affects vital medical machinery. Nearly half of Puerto Rico’s residents rely on Medicaid, which is not as well funded federally on the island as it is in the states. The problems are compounded by a looming financial crisis that experts say could leave a quarter of the island’s residents without medical care early next year unless Congress and the Trump administration extend special help. Washington caps the island’s Medicaid assistance. This means that while federal revenue covers 75 percent of the Medicaid bill for low-income states like Mississippi, Puerto Rico gets only about 15 to 20 percent coverage. So it resorts to local budgeting and more debt, thereby worsening the bankruptcy spiral.

Edgardo Beniquez Santiago and Luisaliz Rivera,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. When Hurricane Maria plowed through Puerto Rico last September 20, she left a path of unprecedented destruction. Homes and businesses were destroyed, communities were flooded, power lines and bridges collapsed and agonized families went for days without knowing about the health and well-being of family and friends. Related: Staying on Course Despite the Ravages of Hurricane Maria Recently updated figures reported by CNN now estimate that more than 4,600 lives were lost. As for those who survived, once the storm passed, Puerto Rico was left in a state of disaster: The hurricane knocked out most of the island’s power grid leaving approximately 3.7 million residents in the dark; CNN reported it as the second-largest blackout in history. My business and life partner, Luisaliz Rivera, and I went through this experience firsthand. Our homes were flooded and our families fought for survival. And the timing, professionally, speaking, couldn't have been worse: Maria hit just as we were working to open a new business -- our first as entrepreneurs together. Image credit: Edgardo Beniquez Santiago and Luisaliz Rivera We were franchisees opening Marco's Pizza's 900th restaurant, in what was to be a hallmark for our company; our location was -- and is -- Bayamόn, Puerto Rico. I say ""is,"" because while our town took a direct hit from the storm, we're happy to report that we're still here. However, surviving and rebuilding after Maria was a struggle -- one from which we can share lessons learned with other entrepreneurs, particularly those in the hospitality industry, unfortunate enough to suffer through their own natural disaster. Family first Days before Maria hit the Caribbean, we flew to Ohio, where Marco's leading pizza franchise is headquartered, for our final training session prior to opening. While there, we anxiously watched reports about the approaching storm. We knew the training was key to our business success. But we also knew that being so far from home was a risk. And what a risk: Once the hurricane passed, we were stuck without any information, unable to contact friends and family. We immediately flew to Florida in search of the best opportunity to return home; but flights were scarce, leaving us to climb aboard a cargo plane. Upon our arrival, Luisaliz was unable to reach her parents in Utuado -- at the center of the island. Then came a stroke of luck: Scanning social media, we spotted a Facebook photo of her parents' home with “HELP” written in the grass. That told us that her parents were alive -- though in need of rescue. We took a helicopter to the area where they were trapped and brought them to safety. Shoring up our new business Once we ensured the well-being of family members, we could turn our focus to our business and supporting the six other Marco’s Pizza locations on the island. Related: How Entrepreneurship Is Helping to Save Puerto Rico One location was completely destroyed, its exterior and interior demolished beyond repair; but the others recovered. The biggest challenge for all of us franchisees was finding fuel for our generators and setting up a system to receive merchandise. In Bayamón, we had neither electricity nor water. Rubbish covered the streets. And key deliveries were suspended. We ended up getting water and electricity service back prior to our April 6 opening, but not having had service for those months after the storm drastically delayed our progress. Government agencies where we would normally obtain the required permits were closed or lacked the internet, Trying to get materials to complete construction proved nearly impossible. And consistently long lines at the gas stations -- with waits up to eight hours --to get gas for our generators and cars made that post-storm period extremely challenging. Despite the catastrophe, and the huge impact to our personal lives, we prevailed and worked with Marco’s national team to open our store in reasonable time after the September storm. All along, we strived to maintain a ""can-do"" attitude and resiliency. And those lessons learned along the way? There were five: 1. Let your determination prevail. The hurricane severely impacted our build-out and operations. While we faced big hurdles, the true test was how determined we were to hang in there. The solution that worked, we found, was to constantly think through every obstacle we encountered. The lesson learned: Analyze your setbacks, make adjustments to your strategy, and prepare for your next challenge to put your team in the best position to prevail. 2. Prepare your communications system in advance of a disaster. We learned a great deal from the efforts of our fellow Puerto Rico franchise owners. After Hurricane Irma skirted the island prior to Maria, leaving a million without power, those experienced owners knew that preparing a communications system was the only way to keep their restaurants operating. For that reason, they prepared communication mechanisms that could be alternatives to cell phones -- such as social media networks -- and created special accounts for the restaurants' managers and franchises. Channels like Facebook and WhatsApp were key. They were used to fight through each day and properly communicate what was happening in the restaurants in order to coordinate the distribution of food. Once those adjustments had been made and a plan was in place, it was important to stay on top of communication. The lesson learned: Let your employees, clients, and customers know what is happening. Provide notifications regarding ordering, shipping and inventory. Share details of expected opening or re-opening dates. Also consider leveraging social media to provide community updates, well wishes and support/resources you know of or can provide to aid in the recovery. Be as detailed as possible in your communications. This will show your ability to properly deal with problems and develop solutions, even as you gain trust from your company and fellow businesspeople. 3. Recognize that community comes first. When you're faced with adversity, the relationship you build with your community becomes fundamental to survival. Community members look to one other for support, and there is a huge opportunity to play an active role. We teamed up with businesses and restaurants to create a safe haven for families, to provide food, shelter and phones so people could contact loved ones. In some cases, we also provided electrical connections in Marco’s Pizza locations people could use to charge their cell phones and other devices. The lesson learned: Sometimes it's necessary to put “business” on the back burner and focus on strengthening your relationship with the community -- the foundation that holds everything together. 4. Realize that you’re nothing without your team. Your team is the strong support system behind you that is going to make the difference. So, your team should be your priority. Equipment, documents and overall infrastructure can be replaced, but your people can't be. When we returned to open our store, we made sure our employees were part of the process. Many were dealing with their own personal situations, but all were committed to the business and contributed in an immense way. They would come into our location to help keep it on track for its slated opening -- ensuring that the equipment, design and functionality of the store were ready for opening day. Team members also played a key role in the grand opening celebration -- a full day of set-up, cooking and welcoming the community and key players from the Marco’s Pizza home office. Additionally, we had the support of the other Marco’s Pizza locations and the executive team the whole way. As a group, we had brainstormed and gotten creative with equipment to stick to our grand opening time line. Example? We personally engineered a hood/kitchen component to keep things on track due to the fact that one hadn't been delivered. The lesson learned: Recognize how valuable other people are to your success. 5. Create a Contingency Plan Having overcome adversity, we now know that now is the perfect time to prepare for the next disaster that may impact your business (actually, businesses ; we intend to open two more Marco's locations). You should do the same. Outline how your business will respond to tragedy: Consider operations, build-out, processes, vendor partners, employees, etc. Update your current plan now while the topic is top of mind so you will be prepared next time misfortune strikes. Puerto Rico’s small and midsize businesses represent 90 percent of private companies on the island and about one third of the workforce, as reported by Bloomberg -- and the economic impact of the storm has been devastating. Of the nearly 45,000 businesses in Puerto Rico, an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 remain closed, the Wall Street Journal reported in March. But now, more than nine months after the storm, we’re seeing extensive rebuilding. Maria's aftermath has been a true story of resiliency, collaboration and community engagement, as entrepreneurs across the island fight to come back. Luisaliz and I celebrated our own big win on April 6, with that grand opening celebration. It was more than just a normal grand opening because of what we'd all gone through: In fact, our support team and community partnership came together as we opened our doors to the public.

Nina Zipkin,"Name: Angiemille Latorre Title: Co-founder and chief button pusher Company: Strategy and design firm Seriously Creative Founded: 2006 Why did you want to start your business? What problem did you want to solve? Before we started our business 11 years ago, I was working in advertising. I was already at a director's level, and my husband was working for Red Bull. We kept coming home and talking about the same thing, that it was so hard to get our people to come up with ideas. We started reading and discovered design thinking. When we discovered that and put it into practice with our own teams, we realized it was so empowering, [and it] created change in our organizations. We said, ""No one's doing this in Puerto Rico, so why don't we start our own company?"" What has it been like since the storm? What challenges have you dealt with? How have you navigated them? We opened two weeks after the financial crisis. So to us that was like, ""Oh my God, what have we done?"" The truth of the matter is, from crisis comes opportunity. Everyone had to reassess how to move forward. For us, that was an opportunity because we were helping people get their strategy going for what was next. The recent hurricane is just a third or fourth hurricane we've had in 11 years of business. It is just another situation that we've had to navigate. It's one thing for people to be uncertain, and another thing for you to see people on the streets. I was very heartbroken. With time and patience and collaboration, our space changed from being a brainstorming space to being a refuge. Even doctors that had no brainstorming to do, we had electricity so we had them all go and do a little work there. In Puerto Rico, things have been challenging for so long, people look for the small wins. We go one day at a time, one step at a time, and we're resilient that way. That keeps us going because we're also agile enough to be changing. We always have our north, but we can change direction and keep going. When things are tough, how do you stay motivated? Having a growth mindset really works for me. I'm very optimistic. For anything that you complain about there's an opportunity to fix it. An island like Puerto Rico, with so many problems and challenges, is full of opportunity for me. Taking a deep breath and taking a break every once in a while when things get really tough and unfocusing to focus again helps me, too. I have a network of other entrepreneurs, and we help each other and we talk to each other about what our challenges are openly, and they give me a lot of inspiration. [I also look to] my family. It's never been about the money. It's really that I love what I do. What is next for your business? What are your goals for the future? At least in my home, electricity came back in January. Our internet and communications was horrible. So we had to look for a way to work while we waited to normalize. I don't think anybody has a plan of not being able to communicate properly for months, and having a business survive. The hurricane forced us to have the courage to start doing something that we have talked about for a long time, which is expanding into the U.S. and specifically D.C. So we started talking a lot more with our U.S. clients, and we've expanded. What do you want people to know about the entrepreneurial landscape right now in Puerto Rico? There's so many opportunities because Puerto Rico is a blank canvas now. Anything to do with technology, with energy or with services for the tourism industry, which will soon start back up again. In order for us to be key players in transforming the economy, the government in Puerto Rico has to facilitate a better permit process. I know of many people who have tried to start businesses and then had to quit because of a permit that's taken 180 days. What can other entrepreneurs do to support Puerto Rico? Mentor someone. There are organizations that can help with that match. Parallel 18 is an accelerator for startups not only in Puerto Rico but internationally. Or if you are an entrepreneur and you happen to travel to Puerto Rico, I would encourage you to go and see how you can mentor startups. Who knows? That can be an opportunity for some kind of partnership or alliance.","The island has faced challenges since the devastating storm, but the startup community is focused on the future.",2018-05-11T13:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}","3 Women Entrepreneurs Share Their Stories of Courage, Community and Innovation 8 Months After Hurricane Maria",https://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/313249,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180510204506-GettyImages-758585679.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,Hurricane Maria,1
http://www.facebook.com/fox6news,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Gusty winds began to hit the eastern Caribbean on Sunday as Tropical Storm Beryl advanced rapidly toward a region struggling to recover from last year’s deadly hurricanes. The government of Dominica said it would shut down its water system and Puerto Rico’s governor warned of likely new power outages. People on islands across the region stocked up on food and water and prepared for possible damaging winds, rains and waves. Intermittent rainstorms already were hitting Dominica early Sunday, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) of rain could fall as the storm moves through or near the island on Sunday night. Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit told people to store water because the government would be shutting down the water system as a precaution, and he warned them to stay alert despite the storm weakening. “They should not let their guard down,” he said. Meteorologist Marshall Alexander told The Associated Press that officials were worried about those still living with tarps on their roofs after Maria slammed into Dominica as a Category 5 storm last year, killing dozens of people. “We are in a vulnerable state,” he said. “The system can still cause a lot of damage regardless of whether it’s a tropical storm or a hurricane.” Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Chris formed off the Carolinas, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was likely to grow into a hurricane while heading to the northeast, roughly parallel to the coast. It wasn’t projected to directly threaten land over the next few days, though forecasters said it could kick up dangerous surf and rip tides. In the Caribbean, a tropical storm warning was up on Guadeloupe and Dominica and long lines were reported at grocery stores on several islands as people shopped for food and water. “We can’t take chances with weather,” Jeffrey Xavier, manager of Mr. Clean Bed &amp; Breakfast in Dominica, said in a phone interview. “There was a lot of buying.” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said in a press conference late Saturday that the island could experience power outages and urged people without sturdy roofs to move in with relatives or a government shelter. More than 1,500 power customers remain in the dark more than nine months after Maria, and some 60,000 people still have only tarps for roofs. “I’m praying for all the brothers who are still living under a plastic roof,” said 79-year-old Alfonso Lugo in the southeastern Puerto Rico town of Humacao. “They’re the ones who are suffering the most now. They’re the ones who have been forgotten.” Lugo lost his roof and two walls to Maria, and was waiting on Sunday for volunteers to secure his new roof before Beryl arrives. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) Sunday. It was centered 210 miles (335 kilometers) east of Martinique and was moving west-northwestward at 23 mph (37 kph). The storm was forecast to weaken into a low-pressure system Monday by the time it reaches seas just south of Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. Forecasters warned that the U.S. territory could see between 15 to 25 mph (25 to 40 kph) winds, as well as heavy rains that could cause flooding and mudslides. National Weather Service meteorologist Carlos Anselmi told the AP that 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain was expected across Puerto Rico, with double that in isolated areas. Off the U.S. East Coast, Tropical Storm Chris was centered about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). It was expected to remain almost stationary over the next few days before growing to hurricane force and moving to the northeast.","fox6now.com Tropical Storm Beryl speeding toward eastern Caribbean fox6now.com SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Gusty winds began to hit the eastern Caribbean on Sunday as Tropical Storm Beryl advanced rapidly toward a region struggling to recover from last year's dea…",2018-07-08T16:07:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fox6now.com'}",Tropical Storm Beryl speeding toward eastern Caribbean - fox6now.com,https://fox6now.com/2018/07/08/tropical-storm-beryl-speeding-toward-eastern-caribbean/,https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/s096131537.jpg?quality=85&strip=all,,Fox6now.com,Hurricane Maria,1
KERRI MacDONALD and MORRIGAN McCARTHY,"Ms. Rodriguez, a freelance photographer who covers Puerto Rico for The New York Times, “searched for something else” in familiar places. When I first read the poem, I felt like it was both a reminder and permission to see the beauty in life, something I feel I had forgotten after covering and living the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The disaster left me in some ways hopeless. I felt it was a permission to accept that nothing is perfect, that life is made by experiences of love and of hurt, but that it is important to live it — to feel it and to remember that we are all “a working title.” I went to photograph familiar places where I usually look for images that speak to the economic crisis or the disaster, and I searched for something else. I wanted to avoid repeating the visuals that have become the representation of my homeland in the past years. We are more than the crisis. I photographed the ocean with a little palm tree in the corner. I come from three generations of people from islands — in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Spain. The ocean is part of who I am. I photographed in Old San Juan, searching for daily moments and color, life. I photographed in Cayey, the town where my family is from. And I photographed my grandmother, because life is deeply connected to ancestry and the experiences of love and hurt by those that came before me. She did not want to have her photo taken because she had not dyed her hair and she said did not look “beautiful” — so I photographed her hidden white hair, her years, her wisdom. In Comerío, a town affected by the storm, I photographed the remnants, the life, the faith, the hope, a hammock in an unconventional place that seemed like a beautiful place to rest. The floor base of what was once someone’s home and was taken by Maria last September. An image of Christ placed outside, near a big Puerto Rican flag painted on a rock. It was, personally, a challenge to say: How can I photograph there places that have formed me with the core of what I felt from the poem in mind — that sense of life and complexity of being? I put the poem in the lock screen of my phone for the days I was shooting, so I was constantly thinking about it. I think it changed as I went out to shoot and gave myself permission to see my surroundings with more care and love, and with less pain and hopelessness.",Photographers read poems written by 6 women.

https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank,"This small meteorological irony reveals big things about the Age of Trump. Fifty weeks ago, following the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which we now know killed some 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico, Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee called for hearings into the flawed federal response to the 2017 storms in Puerto Rico. The Republican majority hemmed and hawed, dithered and stalled for nearly a year, before finally this month scheduling a hearing on 2017’s storms for Thursday — just in time for Hurricane Florence to hit the Carolina coast. FEMA administrator Brock Long, quite reasonably, canceled his appearance to deal with more pressing business. The hearing was called off. It’s a bit late to learn from 2017’s mistakes when 2018’s storms are already making landfall. Heckuva job ! This week we see two opposing forces of nature: Florence, with winds of nearly 130 mph, and President Trump’s Washington, which hardly moves at all. Trump’s response to the tragedy in Puerto Rico has been to congratulate himself for his amazingly fantastic relief efforts. On Tuesday, he celebrated his “ incredibly successful ” response to Maria, which killed about as many Americans as the 9/11 attacks. On Wednesday, he said his team “did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico,” again blaming the island territory’s infrastructure and San Juan’s “incompetent” mayor for any troubles. And the Republican majority in Congress has assisted Trump’s fiction by suppressing an investigation. Various committees held hearings on aspects of the 2017 hurricanes — though these do not appear to have focused on Puerto Rico relief or to have resulted in the release of findings. If it is true that those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it, we are up a creek in a flash flood. Trump first established his concern for Puerto Rico after the storm, when he tossed victims rolls of “ beautiful, soft towels,” telling them “you can be very proud” because only 16 people at the time had been reported killed, compared with “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” The death toll from Maria in Puerto Rico today stands at 2,975 — 1,000 more than Hurricane Katrina’s toll. Trump continued this compassionate display in June, when he used a FEMA briefing on hurricane preparedness to talk about his dealmaking abilities, his political endorsements, his fondness for coal and his upcoming summit with North Korea. He didn’t mention the dead in Puerto Rico but did assert that “our level of popularity is great.” This week, after beginning the 17th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks with a tweet disparaging the FBI and Justice Department, Trump said Puerto Rico’s governor would vouch for Trump’s “incredibly successful” hurricane response: “If you ask the governor, he’ll tell you what a great job” he did. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló responded by saying: “This was the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle. Now is not the time to pass judgment.” No, judgment time was during the past year, when lawmakers could have forced FEMA to make changes. But the Senate Homeland Security committee, which has jurisdiction over the matter, had only one hearing with Long on the topic. Democratic calls in both chambers of Congress for a commission went nowhere. Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee complained this month that Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) held no full committee hearings on the hurricanes (there were two subcommittee hearings), no transcribed interviews, only three agency briefings and no briefings from White House officials; requested no documents from the White House; and issued no subpoenas. By contrast, after Katrina, then-Chairman Tom Davis (R-Va.) led a select committee that arranged nine hearings, scores of interviews and dozens of briefings and obtained numerous documents from the George W. Bush White House using subpoenas. Davis issued a 569-page report faulting the Katrina response at all levels. A Gowdy spokeswoman said the committee “has engaged with FEMA relating to its oversight and investigative work on a near-weekly basis,” had various member and staff briefings and reviewed 17,000 pages of documents from agencies. The Government Accountability Office, a research arm of Congress that has no enforcement powers, issued a report this month citing problems with debris removal, inadequate prepositioning of materials, not enough generators, insufficient housing for relief workers, staff shortages, too few bilingual employees, and employees without necessary skills or physical stamina. At the height of FEMA deployments last year, “54 percent of staff were serving in a capacity in which they did not hold the title of ‘Qualified,’ ” the GAO wrote. Even FEMA itself contradicted Trump’s claims of incredible success, saying that it was understaffed and that it needed to “ deliver our programs differently.” Let’s pray FEMA has healed itself and is now up to the task — despite the inaction of a president in denial and a Congress giving him cover.

Tom McKay,"In mid-January, the Hawaiian state Emergency Management Agency sent out an erroneous text to all cell phones in the state warning of a “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII,” sending many residents into an hour-long panic as they ran for cover from what they feared was a North Korean nuclear bomb. Though it first appeared that bad design in the EMA computer system which sent out the alert was to blame, federal investigators later said the alert was intentionally sent by a now-fired employee who mistook an ongoing drill for a real attack. The incident did massive damage to the credibility of the emergency alert system, and risked Hawaiians ignoring any potential future alarms sent out if North Korea or anyone else actually does launch a missile at the Aloha State. The EMA’s director has since resigned. So it’s perhaps not surprising that some legislators want to take the responsibility out of the hands of state governments entirely. Sens. Brian Schatz, Kamala Harris, and Cory Gardner have introduced bipartisan legislation titled the Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats, which is intended to make the federal government the sole authority on the matter. Per a press release from Schatz’s office, the ALERT Act would “restrict the authority to alert the public of a missile threat to the federal government,” with only the Federal Emergency Management Agency allowed to send such alerts via its Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. The legislation also would “require FEMA to establish a process to promptly notify state authorities when a missile alert is issued so they can activate their own protective action plans to ensure public safety.” “States are laboratories of democracy,” Schatz quipped in the statement. “They should not be the laboratories of missile alerts. The people who know first should be the people who tell the rest of us. This legislation makes clear that the authority to send missile alerts rests with the federal government.” According to Hawaii Now, Schatz says U.S. Pacific Command currently has to liaise with the state government to send out an alert, while the legislation would allow it to send alerts directly through the Department of Defense. The interim director of the EMA, Brig. Gen. Moses Kaoiwi Jr., told Hawaii Now that he was open to considering the proposal. However, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim told the station he was wary the federal government lacks “site specific information” necessary to coordinate a response to any potential disaster and that he hopes local governments would be allowed to send follow-up messages. FEMA has a mixed track record, however. It faced massive criticism for the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and most recently, the agency stands accused of bungling millions of dollars in contracts for disaster relief in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.

DAVID GONZALEZ,"Photo Rafael Ocasio Barreto, 48, in his motel room in Queens, N.Y., where in his bedroom winter coats and new sneakers are piled atop the bed to give to other new arrivals in need. Credit David Gonzalez/The New York Times Rafael Ocasio Barreto refused to leave Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria tore through his part of San Juan, Caño Martin Peña, flooding streets with dirty water, toppling power lines and destroying houses. He soldiered on for two weeks, although he was just as devastated as his community. Finally, his friends forced him — wearing just the clothes on his back — to get on a plane to the States. The Federal Emergency Management Agency resettled him at a suite motel in Queens, not far from La Guardia Airport. A tiny Puerto Rican flag adorns his living room, as if he was claiming this corner of Northern Boulevard. In a bedroom, plump winter coats and new sneakers are piled atop the bed. The kitchen is stocked with food. Just as he cared little for material possessions in Puerto Rico, these items are not for him, but to share with other uprooted Puerto Ricans also staying at the motel as they await the next steps when FEMA stops covering their hotel costs on Feb. 14. “I have to give them a hand so they can confront this new life,” Mr. Ocasio Barreto said last week. “In Puerto Rico, even with all its dire needs, you can get someone to help. Here, that really doesn’t exist. Here, it’s about individualism. You feel the racism. It’s not the affection you felt back home. Fortunately, even in this motel, I have found Dominicans, Hondurans and Ecuadoreans who identify with us and extend their hand like a brother nation.” Perhaps it was because he saw too much and felt too much that he made the reluctant trip north. Mr. Ocasio Barreto, 48, had been living in Caño Martin Peña, where he worked with a public-private coalition of eight local communities to address the needs of residents and the environment. More than a century ago, squatters descended upon the area’s mangroves, using debris and castoffs for landfill as they built shacks. Over decades, the mangroves almost vanished as tens of thousands of people settled the area, which mostly lacked proper sewage systems. The hurricane made a tough life worse, and Mr. Ocasio Barreto conducted daily surveys to see what people needed. “Before I left in the morning, I would cry,” he said, his voice cracking. “Then I’d leave the house with my Superman chest puffed out, like nothing affected me.

S.V. Date,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico with new and old falsehoods — in stark contrast to his tone and attitude toward disaster-stricken communities in states that voted for him.
Trump Tuesday wrote, falsely: “Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money,” and then suggested, also falsely, that Puerto Rico is not part of the United States. “The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA.”
“No part of his statement is even factual,” said Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic member of the Florida legislature whose Central Florida district includes thousands of Puerto Rican migrants, including some who moved after Category 4 Maria struck the island in 2017. “His response to Puerto Rico reeks of racism. He treats Puerto Ricans the same way he treats Spanish-speaking immigrants. Like dirt. Like garbage.”
The White House did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment about Trump’s false statements, the tone of which also offers a striking contrast to his statements following previous storms.
“TEXAS: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD!” Trump wrote on Sept. 2, 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit.
And last month, after tornadoes killed 23 in Alabama, Trump wrote: “FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).”
“What makes Puerto Rico different? It’s just really sad,” Smith said. “It’s why he’s so unpopular on the island.”
The Caribbean territory, acquired by the United States more than a century ago following the Spanish-American war, suffered the most devastating damage from a hurricane since Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005. Nearly 3,000 residents died in the storm and in the aftermath — a number Trump claimed was fabricated by his political opponents to make him look bad.
His $91 billion figure appears to be an estimate of how much the reconstruction from the storm will wind up costing over the coming decades. In comparison, Katrina wound up costing $120 billion.
In fact, Puerto Rico has been approved to spend only $300 million in rebuilding assistance so far, the territory’s governor responded on Twitter. “We are Americans, we are your citizens,” Ricardo Rosello wrote. “Puerto Ricans ARE American farmers! American teachers! American citizens! American everything!”
Trump’s latest round of attacks on Puerto Rico started just before midnight Monday after a disaster relief spending bill failed in the Senate because Republicans voted with Trump not to appropriate additional money for Puerto Rico and Democrats would not support a bill that did not include it.
“The politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined, yet their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works,” Trump complained. “FEMA &amp; the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!”
On Tuesday, the president further claimed that he personally was “the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico” but that he “cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments and so little appreciation.”
It is unclear on what basis Trump was making the first assertion, or whether more appreciation from Puerto Rican leaders would lead to faster and better treatment from FEMA.","Trump lashes out against Americans devastated by Hurricane Maria, just a month after promising Alabama tornado victims that he had ordered “A Plus” treatment for them.",2019-04-02T20:41:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Trump Has Only Love For Disaster Victims — Unless They Are Puerto Ricans,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico-tirade_n_5ca3be78e4b0e6ed9467125d,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ca3bf3c240000a1074f5abb.jpeg?cache=7dOvLJ2wzT&ops=1200_630,,Huffpost.com,Hurricane Maria,1
Daniel AlarcÓn,"Several weeks before he would become a folk hero across Puerto Rico, Jorge Bracero slipped in a puddle at San Juan’s central power plant and broke his leg. After a few days in a cast, he began to feel pain so intense he was unable to sleep or eat. When doctors realized he had developed blood clots in his injured limb, they prescribed a six-month regimen of blood thinners and barred him from returning to work for the duration. It was July 2017. So when the first big storms of that hurricane season began bearing down on Puerto Rico, Bracero—a power plant operator with the island’s public electric power authority, known as Prepa—sat on the sidelines, miserable and frustrated, reliant on a pair of crutches. Bracero is 38 years old and stoutly built, with buzzed hair and a dark beard. He has a sharp, pointed nose and prominent eyebrows that sometimes knit up into twin, back-to-back apostrophes at the middle of his forehead—especially when he is concerned. And he was often concerned that fall. When Hurricane Irma hit the island on September 5, Bracero and his wife, Charlot, were among the 1.1 million Puerto Rican customers who lost power. They rode out the storm and its aftermath with relatives who had a generator; Charlot was seven months pregnant with their first child. Bracero slept on a couch, passing his days laid up in the humid late-summer heat, anxious that his wife might go into early labor, and fuming that he couldn’t do his part to get the power back on. “I felt useless,” Bracero says. The job that Bracero was desperate to get back to can be brutal on a good day. On any given shift, he and one or two partners are responsible for operating two 15-story-high boilers, along with the 20 burners that heat them to produce steam and the six massive power-generating turbines that turn under the steam’s pressure. Bracero’s role is to tend to the machinery itself, while his partner sits at a console monitoring the plant’s water, oil, temperature, and pressure levels, constantly relaying information to Bracero. The heat is intense, the work exhausting. When he comes home, his clothes go straight to the balcony because they smell so powerfully of sweat and diesel. Since he was unable to pitch in at the plant, Bracero settled instead for defending his colleagues on Facebook, where predictable rounds of invective were being heaped on Prepa for its failure to restore power. Normally, Bracero’s Facebook persona tended toward cheeky political memes, Game of Thrones jokes, and Star Wars references. But now he took to posting photos of Prepa workers doing dangerous things to get the lights back on. One grainy cell phone image showed a lineman balancing on a helicopter skid in midair, stretching his arms out into space to repair wires at the tip of a utility pole. “And then they yell, GET MOVING,” Bracero wrote. After Irma raked across Florida, he shared a video that someone had taken from high above a field near Jacksonville; the camera slowly panned across a sea of white bucket trucks that had assembled from all across the United States. “That’s why Florida has light and we don’t. That’s 16,000” workers, he wrote. “Here we are alone.” Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico just two weeks after Irma. “I have a very apocalyptic mind,” Bracero says, but the storm’s ferocity was nonetheless beyond what he could imagine. It brought sustained winds of 155 miles per hour and a 9-foot storm surge, cutting a roughly diagonal line across the island from the southeast over a span of nearly eight hours; its trajectory felt almost deliberate, as if plotted out to inflict the most damage. Bracero compared it to a terrorist attack. Eighty percent of Puerto Rico’s electrical transmission lines went down. The entire island lost power. Bracero couldn’t stand being idle anymore. After the storm, several employees of the San Juan power plant were unaccounted for. No one knew when, or if, they would return to work. Without hands on deck, Prepa was never going to get the lights back on. So Bracero pressured his doctor to sign a medical release. Of course, if you’re taking a blood thinner, a cut can be catastrophic, so the doctor agreed on the condition that Bracero wear an extra pair of gloves, an extra long-sleeve shirt, and a pair of spandex pants underneath his work clothes. When he looked in the mirror wearing this new uniform, Bracero laughed. In the boiling heart of a power plant the temperatures routinely soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but he was dressed as if he was going skiing. Once he was back at Prepa, Bracero quickly came to understand the magnitude of the damage. But his head was also still stuck in social media, which—like all media after the storm—was maddening to him. News coverage appeared to be designed to spread panic. “My wife and family were watching me yell at the television,” he says. Nor was Prepa doing a particularly effective job of communicating. So Bracero made another drastic move: “I decided to become a news outlet myself.” He started using his Facebook page to post daily updates on the effort to repair the grid. Favoring extreme transparency, he posted raw screenshots of the spreadsheets listing the work assignments of every power and light brigade on the island, alongside frank attempts to explain how the grid works and what it would take to get each part of it up and running. One day, when a steam turbine at a major power plant failed, he dug up an animated video about how steam turbines work. He warned that the clip was “ASTRONOMICALLY BORING” but pointed people to the five-minute mark if they wanted to get a visual sense of the component that was broken. Toward the end of each post, Bracero would switch gears and offer a kind of running pep talk; he developed a voice that was simultaneously gentle, urgent, and reassuring, completely free of cynicism or panic. In practically every update, he implored his readers to post videos as soon as their lights came back on. “Tomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,” he wrote to people who were about to regain power. “Help wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!” He’d vary the message slightly, so it didn’t seem like boilerplate. “In the dark we have met again as neighbors. Don’t forget,” he wrote. “Don’t go back to your bubble.” To people whose pleas for help flooded his comments, he said: “The moment will come. You are not forgotten.” When people did post images of their lights finally on, and photos of their freezers full of all the ice they had made for their neighbors, his response was unfailingly earnest. “I’m proud of you!” he wrote, again and again. By publicly sharing inside information from Prepa, Bracero knew he was taking a risk—he was afraid he might lose his job—but he did it anyway. “If I get fired, it’s for doing what’s right,” he thought. By November, he had to switch over from his personal Facebook page to posting as a public figure on a fan page, because he was overwhelmed by posts, tags, and messages. Within a day, his new page had more than 12,000 followers. Someone made a portrait of Bracero in the style of Shepard Fairey’s famous image of Barack Obama—an ersatz block print of Bracero with his long beard and hard hat, an enormous smile on his face—and this became his public profile picture. People sometimes stopped him in the street to thank him, to give him a hug. In private, however, Bracero was frightened. Now that he was in contact with thousands of Puerto Ricans, he could feel how fragile they were—how fragile the whole island was—after the storm. “I wasn’t expecting this level of desperation,” he told me. “It scares the shit out of me.” Jorge Bracero, a power plant operator with Puerto Rico's public electric power authority, known as Prepa. All across Puerto Rico over the past year, people like Bracero have taken matters into their own hands in ways that are both inspiring and distressing. When it became clear to Javier Jiménez, the mayor of a northwestern town called San Sebastián, that power wasn’t going to be restored right away after Maria, he decided to go rogue. He gathered a handful of brave (some might say reckless ) city workers, along with a few retired Prepa employees willing to volunteer, and mobilized them to reconnect the 40,000-person town to the grid themselves. It was inordinately dangerous, but Jiménez felt that the greater risk was inaction. San Sebastián is about two hours from the capital, San Juan, and for many residents, particularly the elderly and the infirm, having electricity was a matter of life and death. “It was a state of emergency,” the mayor told me. “Nobody could’ve stood in my way. Not Prepa. Not the governor. Not the president of the United States.” Jiménez called his band of vigilante line workers the PPA—the Pepino Power Authority—after the surrounding Pepino mountains. The PPA asked men and women in San Sebastián to come out with their own machetes to prune back the brush and tree limbs, helping clear a path to fallen poles near their homes. Then the PPA’s core team of volunteers would step in, repairing poles, scavenging parts, and running new cable. Officially, Prepa was not pleased to have a local amateur utility reconnecting high-voltage power lines. Unofficially, Prepa employees were slipping spare parts to the renegade municipal power crew, one volunteer told me, to help speed up the reelectrification. In another town, Adjuntas, nestled in the mountains about an hour and a half southwest of San Juan, an NGO dedicated in part to solar power, called Casa Pueblo, became a pillar of the local recovery. When the town’s 18,000 residents were cut off from the rest of the island after Maria, the NGO’s solar-­powered radio helped authorities find out which roads were clear and which families were in danger, and attend to emergencies when the central government and federal authorities were not yet responding. Casa Pueblo subsequently gave out some 14,000 solar-powered lamps and also offered a solar-charged satellite phone at its offices for locals to use. At any given time, five to 10 people waited to make a call. Arturo Massol, the associate director of Casa Pueblo and an ardent evangelist for decentralized, renewable energy, described what was happening on the island as “an energy insurrection.” Ordinary Puerto Ricans, he said, had woken up to the fact that when it came to electricity, they would have to look for alternatives. “Tomorrow help others cook, help those who have no light to feel a gift of normalcy,” Bracero wrote to people who had regained power. ""Help wash clothes, help cook. Make Ice!” On the mainland, green-tech commentators pointed to Maria as an opportunity to turn the island into a laboratory for experimenting with microgrids, renewables, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Two weeks after the storm, a Twitter user in Virginia named Scott Stapf issued a hypothetical challenge: “Could @elonmusk go in and rebuild Puerto Rico’s electricity system with independent solar &amp; battery systems?” Musk replied with characteristic bravado: “The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” But as they waited for the lights to come on, the vast majority of Puerto Ricans found alternatives to the grid in the most obvious, least sustainable places. Diesel and gas generators became the island’s constant, deafening background noise. Long orange extension cords slithered out of windows, connecting houses to one another, as neighbors shared the power their generators were producing. (One of Bracero’s constant refrains on Facebook was a set of pleading instructions on how to power multiple houses using one generator without hurting anyone.) During its busiest period after the storm, one store in San Juan was selling about 400 generators a day. In the town of Río Grande, less than an hour east of San Juan, the Puerto Rican journalist Ana Teresa Toro told me the hurricane had forced her to rethink the viability of the island itself. “You can’t trust the infrastructure anymore,” she said. Barely anyone she knew had stayed at their normal weight after the storm: Without consistent refrigeration, people either ate processed food and put on pounds or they suffered through shortages and depression and lost weight. Toro told me some of her friends joked darkly about the thrilling results of this diet. Heroic improvisation and gallows humor can only get a population of 3.3 million people so far. Electricity is, of course, the utility upon which modernity rests. Without it, there can be nothing approaching normalcy. And the crippling cost of keeping generators fueled just underlined how essential grid power was. Solar power, meanwhile, was uneven without powerful battery backups—and while the number of such batteries on the island was growing, thanks to companies like Tesla, there were still hardly enough to make a dent in demand (see “Balloons, Batteries, and the Crypto Invasion”). Yes, Prepa was a basket case—dysfunctional, archaic, overwhelmingly reliant on imported oil—but it was still palpably and undeniably Puerto Rico’s most critical infrastructure. However ­little people trusted it, there were very few ways around relying on it. As the post-Maria period moved past its feverish first few weeks, electrical power inevitably became the simplest way of measuring progress toward recovery. And Bracero became one of the most trusted voices on technical questions that had come to feel like existential ones. How many people are connected now? What percentage of the population? When is the 50900 transmission line going to be operative again ? The bigger question was not so much whether the crisis would lead to a new model for climate resilience, but whether the existing system would even be up and running by the next hurricane season. Doing so would require repairing far more than the damage caused by a single storm in September 2017. Javier Jiménez, the mayor of San Sebastián, took power restoration into his own hands and founded the Pepino Power Authority. Arturo Massol, the associate director of the NGO Casa Pueblo, describes Puerto Rico's response to the aftermath of Maria as an ""energy insurrection."" When Jorge Bracero began working for Prepa back in 2005, it was an institution that commanded some respect. By some measures, Prepa was (and still is) the largest public electric utility in the US, serving more customers than the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power or the Long Island Power Authority. Its grid, splayed across the rugged landscape of Puerto Rico, had been instrumental in the island’s economic development. Its finances were sound. “I chose to be a blue-collar worker,” Bracero recalls. But as it happened, 2005 was also around the time when Puerto Rico’s entire economy began a long, as yet unchecked slide, taking Prepa with it. The causes of the collapse were no mystery. For decades, federal tax law had offered US corporations major exemptions if they set up shop in Puerto Rico. Waves of this tax-incentivized industrialization had brought petrochemical plants, and then pharmaceutical and tech companies, to the island. But by 2006 the last of those tax breaks were phased out, and an exodus of Puerto Rico’s industrial employers began in earnest. The island’s GDP per capita fell in tandem. Unemployment spiked. Between 2000 and 2015, as economic stagnation took hold, nearly 10 percent of the population, mostly working-­age Puerto Ricans, left for the mainland. The island’s tax base became a hopelessly moving target. From 2002 to 2014, the Puerto Rican government overestimated its revenue eight times, on one occasion by as much as 19 percent. Deficits grew year after year. To cover costs, Puerto Rico began to borrow heavily, issuing bonds to close budgetary gaps in ways that might be charitably described as creative. And they were easy to sell, in part because of another quirk in the US tax code: Earnings on Puerto Rican bonds were triply exempt from state, federal, and the island’s own territorial taxes. Investment banks, retirement funds, and individual investors from the island and the mainland bought billions of dollars’ worth, helping to prop up what amounted to a fiscal Ponzi scheme. By 2015 the situation was untenable, and then-­governor Alejandro García Padilla declared that Puerto Rico’s $72 billion in debts were not payable, setting into motion a series of negotiations with bondholders that culminated in an unelected oversight board taking control of the island’s finances. Since then, to pay off creditors, Puerto Ricans have borne draconian cuts in education, public transportation, health, and utilities. As the most economically mobile Puerto Ricans have fled the island, these cuts have fallen on a population that is older, poorer, more isolated—and angrier—than ever. May Day protests in the past two years have turned violent. The years of austerity and economic contraction took a particularly harsh toll on Prepa. In 2016 a report ordered by the regulatory body in charge of overseeing Prepa laid bare the utility’s sorry state with grim clarity: “Prepa’s generation, transmission, and distribution systems are falling apart,” it said. Prepa’s electrical service had cost more than other US utilities, yet its customer interruption rates were four or five times higher. As a result of “historically thin budgets,” Prepa had adopted a self-­defeating policy of postponing maintenance and extending outages to avoid paying overtime to its employees. Blackouts had become more frequent, the report said, while the rate of worker injuries and fatalities in Prepa’s shrinking workforce was “alarming.” Some of the utility’s challenges were a legacy of Puerto Rico’s industrial past. The island’s largest power plants had been built on its less populated southern coast, to serve a now mothballed set of massive petrochemical plants nearby. Now those power facilities were primarily responsible for supplying electricity to the major population centers some 50 miles away on the island’s northern coast, via transmission lines that had to cross a rugged, heavily jungled mountain range. Maintaining those lines was an extraordinary task even in the best of times. The utility was, according to the report’s authors, stuck in a vicious cycle: The precarious state of the grid, which lurched from outage to outage, precluded the kind of massive, visionary investments needed to shore up or renovate the system. Not that Prepa’s leadership seemed much inclined toward vision. Prepa administrators were alleged to have participated in a fraudulent scheme to accept kickbacks in exchange for buying low-quality fuel oil at inflated prices. A 2016 report from a special investigative committee of the Puerto Rican Senate found that labs working for Prepa had manipulated tests of sulfur content in its fuel to cover the utility’s tracks. The scheme is alleged to have involved billions of dollars’ worth of contracts. (A class action filed on behalf of customers is still pending.) On top of it all, the utility was more than $9 billion in debt. Well before the apocalyptic 2017 hurricane season, one thing had been made very clear to all Puerto Ricans: It didn’t take a hurricane to knock out Prepa’s grid. On the afternoon of September 21, 2016, almost exactly a year before Maria made landfall, a single power switch overheated at the island’s largest power plant, causing a cascading blackout that snuffed out the lights for 1.5 million customers. As if to underline the system’s fragility, all of this happened under clear skies. By December 2017, San Juan felt half-empty, permeated by the rumble of generators and the sharp smell of diesel. Puerto Ricans had been leaving for the mainland by the thousands each week. It was common to find wreckage that had yet to be cleared; at major intersections, one side of the street might be lit up and the other still dim—a bolsillo, or pocket, of darkness. The pattern of illumination followed no discernible logic. According to best estimates, roughly half of Puerto Ricans were still living without power. A sketch comedy troupe called Teatro Breve was putting on five sold-out shows a week in San Juan, all about living without power, waiting in lines for no reason, and the myriad daily indignities that made up the post-hurricane ennui. The crowd’s laughter was deep and guttural, almost pained. In one scene, an actor berated her skeptical husband: “The lights aren’t going out today. Jorge Bracero said so!” Outside, on the streets, there were work crews everywhere—line workers from Prepa and from Florida, New York, and Texas in bucket trucks. The Army Corps of Engineers was also on the scene, but federal rules prevented them from upgrading Prepa’s grid. They had to “replace in kind”: A wooden electrical pole felled by Maria had to be replaced by another wooden pole, even if a metal one might better withstand the next storm. Ordinary Prepa employees I spoke to approached their work with a sense of pride and resignation. I spent an afternoon with one brigade of Prepa line workers doing repairs near the city of Bayamón. Raul Lebrón, a grizzled 21-year veteran of the utility, showed me parts he and his coworkers had scavenged from fallen transmission lines, cleaned up, and were now set to reuse. He held a brown porcelain insulator in his hand and estimated it was around 60 years old. The ingenuity of Prepa’s line workers astonished their colleagues from the mainland. Johnny Price, a Con Edison manager from New York who oversees line workers, spent six weeks in Puerto Rico that winter and told me he’d never seen work like this before. “They see a pole, they stop, strip it, use what they can. They would reach into oil-filled transformers and start rewiring on the fly. They do calculations in their head. It was pretty impressive.” But no one could be impressed by the overall slow pace of recovery. In January, Governor Rosselló made an announcement. “The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost,” he said. He announced his intention to privatize Prepa and sell off its assets, and signaled that he intended to move fast. Prepa line workers return power to a home in Puerto Rico. By spring, the number of customers for whom power had been restored in Puerto Rico had climbed past 1.4 million, but it could lurch down again in an instant. On February 11, an explosion at the Monacillos power plant plunged the capital back into darkness. A few weeks later, in early March, blackouts hit San Juan once more, two days in a row. On April 12, a tree fell along one of the island’s electrical transmission lines near Salinas, knocking out power to nearly 1 million people. Six days later, a contractor hit a line with an excavator and the island went dark once more. “As soon as the lights go out, my phone blows up,” Bracero told me in April. “People are traumatized.” He was as busy as ever at work, recovered from his injuries, and posting all the time. During the second blackout that month, one of Bracero’s updates was shared more than 4,000 times and gathered hundreds of comments. The thread included conspiracy theories about the privatization effort, speculating that the outages were part of a plan to further delegitimize the utility, paving the way for Rosselló’s deal. All day long, Bracero provided updates, trying to maintain the same tone of serenity he had been using since the hurricane. That month, I went to see Francisco Rullán, the official appointed by Governor Rosselló to direct public energy policy and help oversee the government’s privatization plans for Prepa. His office sits in what is known as La Milla de Oro, San Juan’s Golden Mile, the city’s financial center. There isn’t much that’s golden about it anymore, the disrepair and blight that preceded the storm apparent even here in boarded-up windows and half-empty office buildings. A modest gathering of former teachers stood in front of the building, protesting cuts to their pensions and school closures, posing for pictures in front of their homemade signs, and handing out flyers to passersby. Before assuming his current role, Rullán had worked as an engineer at Prepa for more than two decades, so he knew the utility from the inside and was keenly aware of both its assets and its shortcomings. But Prepa’s inability to fulfill its mission of providing consistent electricity to Puerto Rico was, no matter how you looked at it, a scandal. It was, after all, an inefficient state monopoly that lost money despite its captive customer base. “My entire family still has no power,” he told me, just moments after we’d sat down. He was referring to his parents, who lived in a town called Utuado, in the island’s mountainous center. “I always use them as an example. Going without power has become normal.” He encouraged me to visit them so I could see for myself. The first step in the privatization plan, Rullán told me, was to get Puerto Rico’s legislative assembly to change the law to allow Prepa to sell its assets. The next step would be to get buyers lined up—either for the entire utility or for different elements of Prepa’s broad portfolio: its aging plants, tens of thousands of miles of power lines, irrigation systems, right-of-way easements, and fiber-optic cable, to say nothing of its contracts with thousands of employees and its considerable debt. The new Prepa, he assured me, would offer lower prices for the consumer, more options, 50 percent renewable fuel sources by 2040, microgrids, and more. But many observers were skeptical. Rosselló’s proposed bill to privatize Prepa had explicitly blocked the utility’s regulator, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, from overseeing the sale of private contracts. The plan instead stipulated that Prepa’s seven-member governing board would run the 18-month-long process. The credit-rating agency Moody’s called the timeline “quite aggressive.” Cathy Kunkel, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, worried that privatization without regulatory oversight would just open up opportunities for corrupt, politically driven business deals. Prepa’s leaders, after all, had already been accused of taking kickbacks and making bad deals for their customers, as with the fuel oil scandal. And the fact remained that Prepa was the largest single public asset in all of Puerto Rico—the biggest thing the territory had left to sell off. What terms might a buyer demand to purchase a creaking electrical system that provides power to a shrinking customer base on an island sure to be hit by more storms and hurricanes ? In a report that Kunkel helped author, the IEEFA was particularly dubious that a new private owner, absent robust regulation, would voluntarily shift toward renewable fuel sources: Why would you pave the way for distributed forms of energy generation, like solar, when they compete with the centralized power grid you’ve just bought? I asked Rullán what the model was for a wholesale transformation of a public utility like the one he was proposing. He shook his head; Puerto Rico would be the model. His tone wasn’t boastful; it was optimistic in a way that felt surprising, given the context. “What we do here will make history,” he said. José Roman, then the interim president of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, the sidelined regulatory body overseeing Prepa, was less optimistic. He wasn’t opposed to privatization in principle, but he had ­little faith in the process that had been set in motion. Privatized energy markets have to be designed carefully: Supply and demand must always be in balance, or the entire system fails. He feared that the sale would become yet another missed opportunity for the Puerto Rican consumer. “Yes,” he told me. “We will be studied. We’ll be studied for everything we did wrong.” A shower that has been rigged to work without electrical pumps at a nursing home. The facility, run by Luz Collazo (pictured), went without grid power for nine months. During my final trip to Puerto Rico in April, I decided to visit Utuado, the town where Rullán had said his family was still living without power. Along the road there, I ran into two men picking up telephone wire that had been knocked down by the storm. Michael Casiano and Carmelo Fuentes were cutting the cable they had gathered into meter-long lengths, stacking the pieces in the bed of their beat-up truck, and then bringing it to someone from the phone company, they told me. They seemed happy to have a job. Casiano was tall and thin, wearing dark glasses. He had a broad, friendly smile. Fuentes was heavyset and strong, with thick arms and giant hands. Fuentes told me he’d almost lost his mind after Maria, and though I barely pressed him, it soon became clear he wasn’t speaking in metaphor. His family had had no water and never managed to buy a generator. Everything seemed hopeless. One of Fuentes’ neighbors, a 22-year-old woman, had hung herself. The young woman’s mother and brother had followed suit, though both survived. I asked Fuentes how he knew he was having mental troubles. “Because I was arrested,” he told me. He woke up in a straitjacket. But he was better now. He smiled bravely, as if to prove it. Casiano wanted to agree but instead offered: “Puerto Rico can’t withstand another one of these.” Along the way to Utuado, the roads narrow and snake. These sparsely populated towns up in the hills, where the brush is thick and the trees curve over the roads, may well be the last places where power is restored. If another massive storm comes, residents worry they’ll find themselves once more at the back of the line. Rullán’s parents met me halfway up the hill, and we drove up together toward a small nursing home called Ciudad Dorada, Madre de Dios, which was still operating without grid power. Its director, Luz Collazo, told me she couldn’t afford to use her generator much; she was spending around $300 a week on diesel. She had invested thousands of dollars in solar panels, but the building was too large for them to power it all at once. A visitor staying in the home had died a few weeks after Maria. Two of Collazo’s 10 residents needed oxygen, more than half had Alzheimer’s, and all but one were over 80 years old. For hot showers, Collazo and her husband, Miguel, warmed water on the stove. They also gathered rainwater in a large plastic kiddie pool on the roof. Collazo took me out to the terrace, looking over a lush valley. “No one’s come to pick up the power lines,” she said. “No one’s even come to survey the damage.” What was most maddening was that the vast majority of the utility poles along the road to the nursing home had survived. In all, Collazo’s nursing home would go without grid power for nine months. By the spring, one piece of good news had arrived from Washington: The new congressional budget allowed for an exception to the usual rules of federal disaster funding, and now FEMA could pay for major upgrades and new designs for Prepa’s grid. But that exception was only guaranteed to apply as long as the utility stayed public. Nevertheless, on June 11, the Puerto Rican legislature approved a bill to privatize Prepa. And on June 20, three weeks after the start of the new hurricane season, Governor Rosselló signed it into law. Exactly one month later, Prepa was in crisis once again. On July 11, the utility’s CEO of just four months, a non-Spanish speaker named Walter Higgins, announced his resignation, citing personal reasons. There had been considerable public outcry over his salary, which at $450,000 ranked among the highest of American public electric utility CEOs. The utility’s governing board, the same body that Rosselló had hoped would oversee the privatization process, then appointed one of its own members as the new CEO. The new head promptly told a San Juan radio station that the $750,000 he’d accepted to work as director of the beleaguered utility was “a sacrifice.” Amid public uproar, the governor asked the board to lower his pay; rather than comply, more than half of the board members resigned in one extraordinary day. By the following week, yet another chief executive had been appointed, the fifth since the storm. In the midst of the shake-up, the governor was on his way to Russia to watch the World Cup soccer finals. Hurricane season was under way, and after the largest blackout in the history of the US, the utility charged with keeping the lights on appeared to be all but leaderless. For workers like Bracero, this was all demoralizing. When we last spoke, he confessed that he’d expected at some point to be named Prepa’s spokesperson, or at least moved to the communications team. But every time he broached the issue, the CEO of Prepa would resign, and Bracero would be back at square one. He still lived an odd double life: at once a public figure and a guy climbing around a power plant in a hard hat, reeking of diesel. He’d been in talks to become an island-wide radio personality, and had in fact been scheduled to go on the air that week. But he’d had to postpone his debut: The San Juan plant was as understaffed as ever, and he had been working double shifts for two weeks straight. “I’ve been doing this for 13 years,” he told me, with weariness in his voice. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep going before he burned out.

Sandro Galea,"afp/Getty Images Nearly one year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the official death toll for the disaster stands at 64. However, a new study, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, estimates that at least 4,645 people have died as a consequence of the storm. That is more than 70 times the official estimate. Perhaps most worrisome, it is not at all clear that we are taking steps to mitigate the consequences of future hurricanes. This observation, as a new hurricane season is about to begin, should give us all pause. With this in mind, what lessons can we learn from Hurricane Maria to better prepare us for future disasters? Here are three. 1. Communities should be ready to handle the full range of health consequences of these disasters. While the new data on the deaths due to Hurricane Maria are sobering, the health effects of disasters such as the hurricane undoubtedly extend well beyond these deaths. They include worsened mental health, lack of access to essential care, and a general deterioration in the health of vulnerable populations. The physical and mental health consequences of disasters are lasting, shaping health for weeks, months, even years after the trauma of the event. When Hurricane Harvey struck Texas and Louisiana, for example, affected populations had to contend with the lacerations, broken bones, flood risk, and sudden death they faced not only on the day of the storm but also in the weeks and months that followed, with mold in their homes, contaminated flood waters, and disruptions in medical care due to flooded hospitals and waterlogged medications. This accumulated hazard continued to undermine health long after the storm had passed. Reviews of the mental health consequences of disasters have found that as many as half of those directly in the path of a hurricane risk developing post-traumatic stress disorder, and 10% of those who live in the general area of the storm run a similar risk. Disasters can also fuel depression and substance use disorders. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, for example, rates of alcohol, cigarette, and drug use increased in New York City. Assessments of those affected by storms should look not only at deaths but entire populations exposed to storms and their aftermath. Health systems need to be prepared to deal with the full range of consequences of these events. 2. Efforts to shore up basic infrastructure must happen well before hurricanes hit. The primary reason for the heavy damage to Puerto Rico was that the stability — or lack — of basic infrastructure in Puerto Rico made the island less able to endure the high-force winds, heavy rains, and physical damage from the storm. Puerto Rico has shown us the fragility of power systems, water systems, and roadways. On September 26, six days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, 58 of Puerto Rico’s 69 hospitals had neither power nor fuel. Weeks later, the situation did not improve. Households went an average of 84 days without electricity, 68 days without water, and 41 days without cellular service. Citizens lacked access not only to health care but also to basic resources. Low-lying coastal regions, like Puerto Rico, are particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. There is simply no substitute for shoring up basic infrastructure and creating disaster plans to bring damaged systems back online ahead of a hurricane to allow these areas to withstand high-force winds and to mitigate loss of life after hurricanes hit. 3. We must invest in human capital well in advance of disasters. The social, economic, and environmental conditions that shape health before disaster strikes are core to deciding how much damage the event is able to inflict, and how quickly communities can recover. While our narratives of recovery often focus on individual resilience, it is the strength of a society as a whole that most determines its capacity to bounce back after the worst happens. We saw this in Puerto Rico, where generations of economic and political marginalization, combined with a shoddy physical infrastructure, set the stage for the misery that continues to unfold. These issues were known about for years. Had they been properly handled, Puerto Rico might have been far more resilient in the face of Maria. Unfortunately, what happened after Hurricane Maria was eminently predictable. We had decades to invest in the island, to fix its roads and power grid, and to reject the economic colonialism that has done so much to undermine Puerto Rico’s fiscal health. In the age of climate change, with extreme weather events becoming more powerful and frequent, we can ill afford to ignore areas that are likely to suffer the devastating consequences of natural disasters. That we will have more Marias is certain, and how we can prepare for them should be clear if we are paying attention.",We aren’t taking enough steps to prepare for future disasters.,2018-05-30T20:02:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",3 Lessons from Puerto Rico: Mitigating the Health Effects of Future Hurricanes,https://hbr.org/2018/05/3-lessons-from-puerto-rico-mitigating-the-health-effects-of-future-hurricanes,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/05/may18-30-850860206-afp.jpg,,Hbr.org,Hurricane Maria,1
Associated Press and Grace Panetta,"Puerto Rico has conceded that Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people on the island last year and not just the 64 in the official death toll. The government acknowledged the higher death toll with no fanfare in a report submitted to Congress this week in which it detailed a $139 billion reconstruction plan for the island. That quiet acknowledgement was first reported Thursday by The New York Times. Puerto Rican officials have admitted that more than 64 people likely died from the powerful storm that knocked out the power grid and caused widespread flooding that made many roads impassable. But a more exact number has been a matter of debate that the government has sought to end by commissioning an academic study from George Washington University due out in coming weeks. A spokesman for Puerto Rico's federal affairs administration told the Times that while the number in the government was a ""realistic estimate,"" his agency was waiting on the results of the George Washington study to announce an official death toll number. The majority of deaths associated with Hurricane Maria are attributed to lack of medical care caused by widespread power outages, especially affecting those who relied on certain machines to stay alive. The after-affects of the hurricane were also linked to spikes in Puerto Rico's suicide and murder rates. Puerto Rico's devastating electric grid outage caused by Maria was the largest power blackout in US history and the second-largest in the world.","Puerto Rico has conceded that Hurricane Maria killed more than 1,400 people on the island last year, and not just the 64 in a previous official death toll.

Adele Cehrs,"What would you do if there were no power or Internet to communicate with your customers? This is a question I had plenty of time to mull over on my recent trip to Puerto Rico, where I was invited to give a workshop on how to communicate effectively after a storm. It was a humbling experience. Many resorts were damaged and still boarded up. The hotel where I was staying was packed with FEMA workers. I spoke to one holdover from the first hurricane. He described how the hotel staff had resorted to old school communications, using the PA system and slipping letters under their guests' doors to provide updates on the storm damage, the level of urgency, and what safety measures to take. (This brought home the importance of having an escalation process for a business in case of emergency, whether it's a hurricane, fire, tornado, or possible shooter). Yet despite the power outages, water shortages, and overwhelming destruction, business must go on. It was eye opening to be among communicators forced to apply techniques that were used before the rise of the Internet. Digital media has spoiled us with its ease, convenience, and deceptively low cost. (A failed digital campaign will cost you on the back end what it saved you up front). Even if you're not in post-disaster mode, getting back to the basics might be something to consider as a complement to your digital initiatives. Traditional Adverting With all the digital marketing spends, are you considering timing and relevancy for your ads? Is digital the best medium for what you're trying to achieve? If not, you may want to rethink your buying strategy. When Maria flooded the island, pools of stagnant water created vast new breeding grounds for mosquitos. Wouldn't you know it; one of the first billboards to go up post-hurricane were for mosquito repellant. The timing, and the medium, could not have been better. Even if the power grid had been working, banner ads for repellant would be less effective. A billboard gets people's attention as they drive by. If it's buggy out and they're feeling itchy, they can pull over and buy some bug spray at the first opportunity. Word of Mouth Marketing Word of mouth marketing is grounded in the principle of reciprocity - the idea that people generally aim to return favors. It's thanks to satisfied customers that companies are able to garner all those glowing endorsements they put on their websites' Testimonials page. It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico, an undeniable opportunity for the construction trade. A local roofer who attended my session needed a way to convince people he could do a better job than his competitors. The advice I gave him was to use his cell to tape recommendations from satisfied customers. The quotes could be played live, while selling a prospect one on one. Eventually, he could use these testimonials in a brochure. When customers praise your work or your product, ask them whether you can quote them in your marketing materials - right after you say thank you. Don't wait until you redo your website and their gratitude is no longer fresh. Direct Mail Your popup ad no longer pops. Consumers have learned to ignore online advertising. Going old school with a glitzy direct mail package, mailing an invitation to a sale of special event, mailing out coupons, gift cards, or reminders - all these tactics provide prospects with a tactile, hands on opportunity to engage with your company. Studies have shown consumers find printed materials easier to read and recall than online content. While it may seem costly, direct mail may now be such a novelty that it works. Public Relations While traditional media still has its place, your first go-to in a crisis situation is PR. A PR professional will help you find the right tone, timing, and level of urgency for your communication. He or she can also identify potential risks or opportunities. This is especially true if you are dealing with a crisis or scandal within your company. After a natural disaster like Maria, PR is your best first step. Show that your company empathizes with people. Demonstrate solidarity. That bug spray company, for example, could have set up spray stations around the island, or even given out free product. If your company demonstrates good corporate citizenship after a tragedy, you will earn your customers' loyalty and respect.","Could old school have new relevance?

"kloria@techinsider.io (Kevin Loria), Kevin Loria","NOAA/NASA Goddard Rapid Response Team The end of November marks the official end of Atlantic hurricane season — 97% of tropical cyclone activity occurs in the six-month between June and November. That's a relief after an intense few months of destructive storms. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was a top-10 hurricane season by most metrics. It set a few all-time records as well. The chart below shows how 2017 stacks up to other years, thanks to data collected by meteorologists at Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project. How Atlantic storms in 2017 compare to other seasons on major metrics. Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project The season was ""extremely active"", to use the National Hurricane Center's technical term. In an ""extremely active"" year, storms have to generate at least 152.5 units of accumulated cyclone energy — a measure of storm intensity, duration, and frequency. 2017 hit 226, mostly due to storms in August and September, when Harvey, Irma, and Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean and US. An ""extremely active"" season also has to meet two out of these three conditions: 13 or more named storms, seven or more hurricanes, and three or more major hurricanes. We hit all three, with 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. Puerto Rico is still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit the island since 1928. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Here are some of the all-time records set this year, according to CSU: September broke all-time records for the number of storm days, hurricane days, and major hurricane days. There were 40.25 hurricane days, since the days of each storm are counted separately. September 8 set the one-day record for accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), thanks the combined forces of Hurricanes Irma, Jose, and Katia. September also broke the record for most ACE in a month. Irma's maximum sustained wind speed of 185 mph made it the strongest storm that's ever existed in the Atlantic, outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. (Including those regions, it's the second strongest after Allen, which reached 190 mph). Irma set a record for maintaining that same intensity for 37 hours, longer than any other storm on the globe. Harvey broke the record for most rainfall from a tropical cyclone in the US, with more than 60 inches of rain falling at two measuring stations in Southeast Texas. This was the first known year that two Category 4 storms made landfall in the continental US: Irma and Harvey. Maria was the first Category 5 storm to hit Dominica and the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. Overall, it was a rough year — one that exceeded forecasters' expectations, even though most called for an above-average season. The exact factors that made it so active are still under investigation, though warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures likely played a role, since that allows storms to pick up intensity. A lack of strong wind shear, which can break apart storms, is considered a factor. Hurricanes can still happen after November ends, however.

NATHANIEL POPKIN,"PHILADELPHIA Bear Swamp is a forest of 400- and 500-year-old black gums, some of the oldest trees in eastern North America, along the Delaware Bay in southeastern New Jersey. The trees have begun to die. The cause is the rising sea, which is making the groundwater at the base of the forest saltier. The trees are doomed. Much of the Glades Wildlife Refuge, which contains the forest, eventually will be under water.
Though I live only 55 miles away, Ive never seen the forest nor had I heard of its old-growth trees until I read about them recently in The Philadelphia Inquirer. This knowledge was enough to make me grieve for the world that is vanishing before us. Earth is rapidly shedding life and the systems that sustain it. We know this but we dont seem to be able to face it, for ours is an age of loss disguised as plenty.
The article about the black gum trees of Bear Swamp prompted me to make a list of other recent examples of ecological loss. The last few months have been full of them. The World Wildlife Fund, for example, recently reported an average population decline of mammals, amphibians, birds and fish of 60 percent since 1970, the year after I was born. 
Scientists have discovered a 75 percent drop in the number of flying insects in protected areas of Germany since the 1980s. Ecologists observing El Yunque, the Puerto Rican tropical rain forest, recently found 60 times fewer invertebrates in their sticky traps than they had in 1976 and this was measured before Hurricane Maria, which devastated the forest.",An article about dying black gum trees hidden in a remote New Jersey swamp led me to make a list of other ecological losses.

CARL HULSE,"But those behind the statehood movement say they will not be deterred and acknowledge it will take dedication and perseverance to overcome the resistance and inertia standing in the way of statehood for Puerto Rico. The debilitating storm that has left some parts of the island still without power has had the benefit of raising American awareness about the island. The statehood push was planned before the hurricane, but the storm has given it new impetus. “What we want to impress upon Congress and, quite frankly, the whole nation is that Puerto Ricans want a change from their second-class status that Puerto Ricans have experienced and has been exposed in the path of Hurricane Maria,” Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico said in an interview Tuesday. The new efforts are scheduled to begin Wednesday when seven members of a congressional delegation appointed by Mr. Rosselló after a successful statehood referendum last year are to present their credentials to the House and Senate in a bid to be recognized. They will hear a speech by the nonvoting representative of Puerto Rico endorsing statehood on the House floor and meet with statehood supporters. Later in the week, statehood advocates intend to demonstrate their potential political clout with a town hall in Central Florida to showcase the growing numbers of Puerto Ricans capable of influencing domestic elections, including tens of thousands who have moved to the mainland since the hurricane. Mr. Rosselló said he intends to try and harness the political power of about 5 million Puerto Rico-born citizens scattered around the country to help the statehood push by pressing and evaluating candidates on their support for that effort. There is no chance that Congress will accept the credentials of the shadow delegation and seat them as representatives of Puerto Rico, which currently has a nonvoting resident commissioner who can participate in congressional debates. But it is a way of making a point. It is also following a well-traveled historical path to statehood. In 1796, the residents of Tennessee decided to force the issue of statehood by holding a convention, drafting a constitution, electing members of the House and Senate and then demanding that the other states let Tennessee in. The state eventually prevailed, and that hardball path to statehood came to be known as the Tennessee Plan. It has been copied by others, most recently Alaska, and Puerto Rico is now utilizing the technique. With an eye toward worries about political realignment, the shadow delegation includes three Democrats, three Republicans and an independent. While they may not share the same view when it comes to assessing the quality of the federal response to the hurricane, they would agree that Puerto Rico’s recovery would have been handled differently if it was a full-fledged state. The new tax law, coming on the heels of the hurricane and a debilitating financial crisis, seemed to Puerto Ricans to be an especially cruel step. The legislation instituted a new tax on intellectual property held by foreign corporations that Puerto Ricans say will eliminate a main incentive for businesses to locate on the island and puts Puerto Rico on the same level as a foreign nation. “We are American citizens and these are American jobs,” the governor said. “It just doesn’t make sense. He and other statehood backers say the island of nearly 3.5 million people — it would be the 30th largest state by population — would have fared much better with full representation in Congress and the right of residents to vote for president. “Because we don’t have political power, because we don’t have representatives, senators, no vote for president, we are treated as an afterthought,” said Mr. Rosselló. “When it is time to vote, there is not accountability.” He and his allies equate the push for statehood with past American civil rights movements, an attempt to remedy an undemocratic remnant of colonial government in a nation that considers itself the world standard in democracy. They also intend to emphasize the contribution that hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have made and continue to make by serving in the military. “The message is very clear,” said Mr. Aguilar, the former Bush administration official. “If you are thinking of the long-term recovery of Puerto Rico, you have to support statehood. We have reached bottom and there is only one answer.” Honored to be part of the #PuertoRico Shadow Delegation to the U.S. Congress in support of statehood for our Island. We are just beginning our work. There should be no doubt: we will perserve and we won’t relent until we achieve our goal. @PRSC51 pic.twitter.com/IrpDXRPfZ9 — Alfonso Aguilar (@amigoaguilar) Jan. 9, 2018 Continue reading the main story","Gov.

Each moment is its own marvel, but most of the conversation revolves around a boat that ended up in someone's yard. During the course of the exchange, the president promises one homeowner to use the power of the presidency to track down the name of an insurance company... And then he congratulates them on the fact that a boat that didn't belong to them ended up on their property. Puzzling, all of it. You're all laughing at Trump but I would 100% support a law that if a boat crashes into your house, you own that boat.

Michele Herrmann,"This Thursday marks the one-year anniversary since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico. The past year has been one of recovery and rebuilding for the island’s 3 million U.S. citizens. The island’s hospitality industry has been eager to get back online, too, with daily flights resuming, cruise ship ports quickly reopening and a large majority of hotels and attractions back up and running. San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital and largest city, has recovered especially well in the year since the hurricane. If you’re looking to support the continued recovery efforts with your vacation dollars, here’s a guide to celebrating the city’s food, attractions and more. Main attractions Within Old San Juan, the sprawling San Juan National Historic Site (admission $7; nps.gov/saju ) tells the story of two striking forts — Castillo San Cristóbal and, about a 20-minute walk, Castillo San Felipe del Morro — built to protect the island against sea and land-based attacks, respectively. Also in Old San Juan, don’t miss seeing the grand 16th-century Catedral de San Juan Bautista (151-153 Calle del Cristo, catedralsjb.org ), the second-oldest church in the Americas, and strolling the iconic Calle San Sebastián, lined with colorful Spanish Colonial-style buildings. Beach scene For some sun and sand, options include Pine Grove Beach, a residential coastline of white soft sand and coconut palm trees in the district of Isla Verde; Punta Las Marias, a popular destination for locals that’s near Isla Verde; and Carolina, a region 15 minutes from San Juan that’s noted for its beach, local eateries selling fried finger foods like alcapurrias, and Piñones, a mangrove forest. Traditional &amp; trendy eats In Old San Juan, get a mallorca (a grilled breakfast sandwich usually stuffed with ham and cheese and topped with powdered sugar) at La Bombonera (259 Calle San Francisco, facebook.com ) and a piña colada at Barrachina (104 Calle Fortaleza, barrachina.com), which claims to have invented the national drink of Puerto Rico. Lote 23 (1552 Avenida Ponce de León, lote23.com ) is a trendy outdoor food lot in Santurce where vendors sell brick-oven pizza, tacos, pommes frites, croquettes, Popsicles and fried chicken sandwiches and more from kiosks and airstream trailers. At Santaella in Santurce’s La Placita Marketplace (219 Calle Canals, josesantaella.com ), Puerto Rican chef José Santaella offers refined versions of Puerto Rican fare; start with the blood sausage curlers and end with the Nutella sandwich. Other notable names with namesake restaurants in Condado include Mexican pastry chef Paulina Escanes (1451 Ave. Ashford, paulinaescanes.com ) and fine-dining chef Mario Pagán (1110 Magdalena Ave., mariopaganrest.com ). Nightlife faves The La Placita de Santurce (154 Calle dos Hermanos), a historic market plaza, becomes a happening street party on Thursday nights and weekends. The craft cocktail bar La Factoria (148 Calle San Sebastian, facebook.com ) is the place to be for dancing in Old San Juan. For some souvenirs In Old San Juan, pick up a hand-fitted Panama hat at Olé (105 Calle de la Fortaleza, olepuertorico.com ), handbags and other goods by local designers at Concalma (207 Calle San Francisco, shopconcalma.com ), and craft food ítems like coffee at Mundo Taino (256 Calle San Justo and 200 Calle Fortaleza, facebook.com ). GOOD TO KNOW Getting there: Nonstop flights to Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan are available on Delta, JetBlue and United, getting there in about 4 hours. No passports are needed for U.S. citizens; just a driver’s license or another valid form of ID. Getting around: Uber is available, and taxis can be found within San Juan’s tourist zones. A car rental can help with exploring beyond San Juan proper. Currency: U.S. dollar Where to stay: In San Juan’s Condado district, the Serafina Beach Hotel (1045 Ashford Ave., serafinabeachhotel.com ) — the first new hotel to open since Hurricane Maria — has waterfront rooms, an ocean-overlooking infinity fresh-water pool and seafood eatery aMare. For Old San Juan, consider the mid-budget boutique hotel Villa Herencia Hotel (23 Calle Caleta Las Monjas, villaherencia.com ) or the B&amp;B, Casa Sol (316 Calle del Sol, casasolbnb.com ), in a restored 200-year-old historic property.",amNY Puerto Rico travel: San Juan back in action a year after Hurricane Maria amNY This Thursday marks the one-year anniversary since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico.

Jack Stewart,"In Ensenada, a Mexican city about two hours south of Tijuana, a new crime fighter has taken to the skies. It’s not a bird, or a plane, or Superman. It’s a drone. And over a few months on patrol, it’s had quite the impact. The city’s police department claims the solitary DJI Inspire 1 Quadcopter led to more than 500 arrests and a 10 percent drop in overall crime rates, with a 30 percent drop in home robberies. It’s the latest example of drones slowly finding their place in civilian life, like soldiers returning from war, seeking to apply their skills to life in a country not entirely comfortable with what they were up to overseas. Unmanned aerial vehicles may have gotten their start with the military, flying recon missions in Vietnam and dropping bombs over Afghanistan. Their use is still causing concern and debate: Earlier this month, Google pledged not to renew a Department of Defense contract for Project Maven, where it was developing AI to interpret drone surveillance video, when 4,500 employees signed a petition against it. But in Ensenada, the police present their use of the drone as an unmitigated success. “It’s helped with reducing response times and also catching people when they do something illegal,” says Jesus Ramos Avendaño, CTO of the Ensenada police force. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones Over four months, Avendaño’s department flew an average of 25 missions a day (more than 1,600 total), deciding where to fly based on 911 call volumes. Operating from a local control room, the police used software developed by California-based Cape, which automates much of the flying process, including takeoffs and landings. Any authorized officer can grab a feed of the video streaming off the drone, from their desk or while out in the field. Cape CEO Chris Rittler says fewer than a dozen quadcopter-style drones could give a city like Ensenada, population 522,000, complete coverage. “The most common use case is in response to an emergency call, when the drone can be redirected from a flight it’s already on,” he says. The aircraft can reach a location before officers get there by road and give them eyes on what’s going on. That sort of rapid response is a big deal in police work. “Thieves have a clock in their head, from when they break a window to when the police arrive,” Rittler says. “What the drone has done is dramatically decrease that time window.” “Thieves have a clock in their head, from when they break a window, to when the police arrive. What the drone has done is dramatically decrease that time window.” Although drones aren’t regularly used for police surveillance in the US on the scale of Ensenada yet, over the past few years, they have proven their usefulness in plenty of ways. Drone builder DJI says that on one day in May, public safety drones saved four lives: UK police found a missing person, semiconscious and just a few feet from a steep cliff, using a drone with a thermal imaging camera. A fire department in Indiana dropped a life vest to a drowning criminal suspect, who had fled into a pond. And public safety officials in Central Texas dropped life vests to a mother and her 15-year-old daughter, who got caught in a rising river. In the past year, drones have helped scout areas of Houston flooded by Hurricane Harvey and restrung electrical cables in Puerto Rico downed by Hurricane Maria. To ease drones into America’s tightly controlled, crowded airspace, the FAA has greenlit 10 pilot projects around the country, all with an emphasis on do-goodery and cooperation between the public and private sectors. Cape is among those taking part, working with the city of San Diego and a local police department on an emergency response project. The details are still in flux, but police say they plan to use drones to do things like assess the extent of a freeway pileup, not surveil suspected criminals. That hesitation to set drones after bad guys will be typical of new projects in America. “What you see is most government offices in the US taking a crawl, walk, run, approach,” says Gregory McNeal, who teaches law and public policy at Pepperdine University in California. He also cofounded drone software company AirMap, which is participating in the San Diego trial. Bringing drones to the domestic theater means proving their usefulness step by step. “I personally believe drones are going to provide enormous value,” he says. “But the only way we’ll realize that is putting in regulatory structure that doesn’t ignore people’s concerns.” Along with public safety and being a nuisance, those concerns include protecting privacy. Compared to obvious helicopters and fixed-in-place CCTV cameras, drones are a potent tool for surveillance. They can go almost anywhere—up to windows, over fences, under tree canopies. Drone operators have a potential model in body cameras worn by cops who enter private property and work in sensitive situations. Police forces using the tech have created policies that attempt to balance privacy and public accountability. Failing to make the people using these little aircraft accountable could spoil the potential to do a lot of good, like the work claimed by the Ensenada police. But if a single quadcopter can really lower crime rates by 10 percent, it’s worth making sure everyone’s happy to see one appear minutes after they dial 911. Except, of course, the crooks.

Bianca Padró Ocasio,"U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson will meet with Hurricane Maria survivors in Kissimmee on Tuesday, as advocates for Puerto Rican evacuees sustain a legal battle with a federal agency over temporary housing aid. Nelson, a Democrat, will be joined by Rep. Darren Soto (D-Kissimmee) and Rep. Nydia Velázquez, also a Democrat, of New York, during a round-table at Hope Community Center with Puerto Rican families housed under the Transitional Sheltering Assistance program. The Federal Emergency Management Agency program was set to expire on Saturday, before a group of advocacy organizations filed a last-minute class action lawsuit. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order on Saturday night, letting families remain in their temporary hotel rooms until at least Thursday. Attorneys for displaced Puerto Ricans on Monday asked another federal judge to extend the program by at least another month. U.S. District Judge Timothy S. Hillman has not made a ruling yet. Last Thursday, Nelson took to the Senate floor to call for an expedited relief bill through “unanimous consent,” which was rejected. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin objected, noting that FEMA has urged against activating the Disaster Housing Assistance Program. This is a breaking news story, check back for updates.
