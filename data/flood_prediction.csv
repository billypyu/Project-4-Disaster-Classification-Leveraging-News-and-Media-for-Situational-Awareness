0,this story originally appeared on grist and is part of the climate desk collaboration in a remote region of antarctica known a pine island bay   mile from the tip of south america two glacier hold human civilization hostage stretching across a frozen plain more than  mile long these glacier named pine island and thwaites have marched steadily for millennium toward the amundsen sea part of the vast southern ocean further inland the glacier widen into a two mile thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of texas there s no doubt this ice will melt a the world warms the vital question is when the glacier of pine island bay are two of the largest and fastest melting in antarctica a rolling stone feature earlier this year dubbed thwaites the doomsday glacier together they act a a plug holding back enough ice to pour  foot of sea level rise into the world s ocean an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet for that reason finding out how fast these glacier will collapse is one of the most important scientific question in the world today to figure that out scientist have been looking back to the end of the last ice age about   year ago when global temperature stood at roughly their current level the bad news there s growing evidence that the pine island bay glacier collapsed rapidly back then flooding the world s coastline partially the result of something called marine ice cliff instability the ocean floor get deeper toward the center of this part of antarctica so each new iceberg that break away expose taller and taller cliff ice get so heavy that these taller cliff can t support their own weight once they start to crumble the destruction would be unstoppable ice is only so strong so it will collapse if these cliff reach a certain height explains kristin poinar a glaciologist at nasa s goddard space flight center we need to know how fast it s going to happen in the past few year scientist have identified marine ice cliff instability a a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire west antarctic ice sheet this century much more quickly than previously thought minute by minute huge skyscraper sized shard of ice cliff would crumble into the sea a tall a the statue of liberty and a deep underwater a the height of the empire state building the result a global catastrophe the like of which we ve never seen ice come in many form with different consequence when it melt floating ice like the kind that cover the arctic ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelf doesn t raise sea level think of a melting ice cube which won t cause a drink to spill over land based ice on the other hand is much more troublesome when it fall into the ocean it add to the overall volume of liquid in the sea thus sea level rise antarctica is a giant landmass about half the size of africa and the ice that cover it average more than a mile thick before human burning of fossil fuel triggered global warming the continent s ice wa in relative balance the snow in the interior of the continent roughly matched the iceberg that broke away from glacier at it edge now a carbon dioxide trap more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet the scale have tipped a wholesale collapse of pine island and thwaites would set off a catastrophe giant iceberg would stream away from antarctica like a parade of frozen soldier all over the world high tide would creep higher slowly burying every shoreline on the planet flooding coastal city and creating hundred of million of climate refugee all this could play out in a mere  to  year much too quickly for humanity to adapt with marine ice cliff instability sea level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or  year ago poinar say a lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologist rob deconto at the university of massachusetts amherst and david pollard at penn state university a study they published last year wa the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice cliff instability into a continent scale model of antarctica their result drove estimate for how high the sea could rise this century sharply higher antarctic model raise prospect of unstoppable ice collapse read the headline in the scientific journal nature a publication not known for hyperbole instead of a three foot increase in ocean level by the end of the century six foot wa more likely according to deconto and pollard s finding but if carbon emission continue to track on something resembling a worst case scenario the full  foot of ice locked in west antarctica might be freed up their study showed three foot of sea level rise would be bad leading to more frequent flooding of u city such a new orleans houston new york and miami pacific island nation like the marshall island would lose most of their territory unfortunately it now seems like three foot is possible only under the rosiest of scenario at six foot though around  million people in the united state would be displaced and the world s most vulnerable megacities like shanghai mumbai and ho chi minh city could be wiped off the map at  foot land currently inhabited by hundred of million of people worldwide would wind up underwater south florida would be largely uninhabitable flood on the scale of hurricane sandy would strike twice a month in new york and new jersey a the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewater into home and building deconto and pollard s breakthrough came from trying to match observation of ancient sea level at shoreline around the world with current ice sheet behavior around  million year ago when global temperature were about a warm a they re expected to be later this century ocean were dozen of foot higher than today previous model suggested that it would take hundred or thousand of year for sea level rise of that magnitude to occur but once they accounted for marine ice cliff instability deconto and pollard s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a business a usual path meaning we don t dramatically reduce carbon emission rapid cut in greenhouse gas however showed antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundred of year pollard and deconto are the first to admit that their model is still crude but it result have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode it could happen faster or slower i don t think we really know yet say jeremy bassis a leading ice sheet scientist at the university of michigan but it s within the realm of possibility and that s kind of a scary thing scientist used to think that ice sheet could take millennium to respond to changing climate these are after all mile thick chunk of ice the new evidence though say that once a certain temperature threshold is reached ice shelf of glacier that extend into the sea like those near pine island bay will begin to melt from both above and below weakening their structure and hastening their demise and paving the way for ice cliff instability to kick in in a new study out last month in the journal nature a team of scientist from cambridge and sweden point to evidence from thousand of scratch left by ancient iceberg on the ocean floor indicating that pine island s glacier shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age the only place in the world where you can see ice cliff instability in action today is at jakobshavn glacier in greenland one of the fastest collapsing glacier in the world deconto say that to construct their model they took the collapse rate of jakobshavn cut it in half to be extra conservative then applied it to thwaites and pine island but there s reason to think thwaites and pine island could go even faster than jakobshavn right now there s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glacier helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea but recent example from other region like the rapidly collapsing larsen b ice shelf on the antarctic peninsula show that once ice shelf break apart a a result of warming their parent glacier start to flow faster toward the sea an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland too if you remove the ice shelf there s a potential that not just ice cliff instability will start occurring but a process called marine ice sheet instability say matthew wise a polar scientist at the university of cambridge this signal the possible rapid destabilization of the entire west antarctic ice sheet in this century once the stress exceed the strength of the ice wise say it just fall off and it s not just pine island bay on our current course other glacier around antarctica will be similarly vulnerable and then there s greenland which could contribute a much a  foot of sea level rise if it melt next to a meteor strike rapid sea level rise from collapsing ice cliff is one of the quickest way our world can remake itself this is about a fast a climate change get still some scientist aren t fully convinced the alarm is warranted ted scambos lead scientist at the national snow and ice data center in colorado say the new research by wise and his colleague which identified ice cliff instability in pine island bay   year ago is tantalizing evidence but he say that research doesn t establish how quickly it happened there s a whole lot more to understand if we re going to use this mechanism to predict how far thwaites glacier and the other glacier are going to retreat he say the question boil down to what are the brake on this process scambos think it is unlikely that thwaites or pine island would collapse all at once for one thing if rapid collapse did happen it would produce a pile of iceberg that could act like a temporary ice shelf slowing down the rate of retreat despite the difference of opinion however there s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea level rise in  the u and uk government began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study thwaites glacier called how much how fast the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five year seeing the two government pooling their resource is really a sign of the importance of research like this nasa s poinar say given what s at stake the research program at thwaites isn t enough but it might be the most researcher can get realistically it s probably all that can be done in the next five year in the current funding environment say pollard he s referring of course to the trump administration s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding the white house s  budget proposal includes the first ever cut to the national science foundation which typically fund research in antarctica it would be sensible to put a huge effort into this from my perspective pollard say structural engineer need to study antarctica s key glacier a though they were analyzing a building he say probing for weak spot and understanding how exactly they might fail if you vastly increase the research now the cost would still be trivial compared to the loss that might happen bassis the ice sheet scientist at the university of michigan first described the theoretical process of marine ice cliff instability in research published only a few year ago he s  year old but his field ha already changed enormously over the course of his career in  when bassis wa conducting his phd research in a different region of antarctica he wa shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the larsen b ice shelf had vanished practically overnight every revision to our understanding ha said that ice sheet can change faster than we thought he say we didn t predict that pine island wa going to retreat we didn t predict that larsen b wa going to disintegrate we tend to look at these thing after they ve happened there s a recurring theme throughout these scientist finding in antarctica what we do now will determine how quickly pine island and thwaites collapse a fast transition away from fossil fuel in the next few decade could be enough to put off rapid sea level rise for century that s a decision worth countless trillion of dollar and million of life the range of outcome bassis say is really going to depend on choice that people make,,,0,1,1,people hospitalized

3,this story originally appeared on citylab and is part of the climate desk collaboration on a gray late winter day a converted chapel in the arsenal the city s medieval boatyard hummed with st century activity engineer were looking at screen that displayed table map and chart on the condition of the venetian lagoon this wa the mose control center the operational heart of a megaproject to protect venice one of the world s most beautiful city from threatening water for nearly seven year the engineer here have raised and lowered virtual door gathering a series of data to be conveyed into a sophisticated forecasting model spread across dozen of island and known a the floating city for it ubiquitous canal and bridge venice ha grappled with inundation for century but due to natural subsidence and the higher tide caused by global warming the city is more vulnerable to flooding than ever before so a flood barrier seemed like the obvious way to thwart future disaster mose an acronym for modulo sperimentale elettromeccanico or experimental electromechanical module is one of the world s largest and highest profile civil engineering work it consists of a series of retractable floodgate stretching across the mouth of the lagoon s three inlet these gate can be raised on command to create a temporary wall against the sea in the event of a high tide work on mose began in  but after countless delay caused by a corruption scandal and financial and structural issue the barrier ha yet to be completed the hard part is done however and most of the engineer at the control center were confident that the system will become fully operational soon since the final leg of construction ha been stalled for month though no one could say exactly when some said later this year others said  wa closer to reality whatever the date it still remains unclear whether mose will adequately protect the city and if so for how long mose operates on the principle of tidal gate in calm weather the gate fill with water and sit on the seabed but when a high tide threatens the water is pushed out by compressed air that s pumped in this allows the gate to surface and prevent the tide from entering the lagoon when the surge subsides the gate again fill with water and sink back to the bottom the idea is quite old said paola malanotte rizzoli a physical oceanographer at the massachusetts institute of technology who wa among the panel of expert enlisted by the italian government to come up with a solution we have evidence that venetian engineer drafted mechanical contraption to hold back the sea a long ago a in the th century nevertheless a barrage of criticism ha accompanied the project since it beginning environmental group said that construction of the barrier would jeopardize the marine ecosystem beyond repair while some politician opposed the idea stating that there were too many unknown and that a cheaper solution wa needed many expert agree however that when the sea rise there aren t many alternative to building a barrier to stop it especially in a one of a kind city like venice the concept behind mose is good said jrg imberger an environmental engineer who teach ocean science at the university of miami but it all depends on what is meant by protection according to imberger if everything go a planned mose will protect venice from flood like the catastrophic one in  for the next three decade or so but since the gate are raised only when the tide reach  centimeter roughly  inch mose won t avoid the flooding phenomenon that already take place in low lying site like saint mark s square which inundates when the tide get above  centimeter about  inch he said this could be potentially fixed by lifting the barrier at lower tide but that would have some adverse effect on the health of the lagoon the outlook get foggier when it come to the long run like much else in this world mose s effectiveness depends on how much carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere over coming decade and hence how fast sea level rise during the barrier s  year lifespan furthermore conflicting statement on it engineering parameter do little to clarify according to a  unesco report three sea level rise scenario for  were considered during the planning phase  centimeter about  inch  centimeter about  inch and   centimeter approximately one foot planner suggested using the second one labeled a prudent but today even the third scenario seems over optimistic with climate change the mediterranean sea is projected to rise up to five foot before  meaning that mean water level could reach the critical threshold of  centimeter that would cause venice to suffer flooding twice a day at high tide malanotte rizzoli maintains that mose wa engineered to handle about  foot of sea level rise the new venice consortium the organization entrusted with building the barrier say the same but this reporter could find no evidence that this wa an official project goal the question of capability is crucial not only because sea level rise make higher storm surge more likely but because it will require the barrier to activate more often increasing wear and tear on a structure that ha already experienced structural problem according to georg umgiesser an oceanographer at the italian national research council s institute of marine science with  centimeter about  inch of sea level rise the barrier will be closed once a day whereas with  centimeter about  inch the gate will be closed more often than they are open more frequent closing doesn t only imply additional maintenance cost umgiesser said but an ever increasing dependence on the barrier to avert severe flooding a failure could be devastating over the year alternative to a seawall have been proposed some offered tweak to the system of mobile gate while others involved different technology still others were aimed only at making the flooding more bearable so far though none ha found wide support at any rate it seems clear that venice like many other coastal city around the world won t be saved by a barrier alone since the  flood the frequency of tide over  centimeter ha doubled each decade said giovanni cecconi head of the venice resilience lab and this trend is not going to stop anytime soon even if emission were curbed it s obvious that mose is not a magic wand he continued but rather something that will allow u to take time to figure out and implement new way to cope with a crisis more climate science,,,0,1,0,santa fe high school  multiple

4,scandal read the facebook post of mexican comedian and journalist jorge roberto avils on march th the government of venezuela ha confirmed on it television station venevision what we all already knew nicols maduro is behind andrs manuel lpez obrador s campaign accompanying the post wa a video that proved what opponent of lpez obrador a three time mexican presidential candidate had long claimed lpez obrador wa a crony of the venezuelan chavista regime and his latest presidential campaign which culminates with the upcoming july st presidential election wa propped up by a foreign regime the video feature the logo of venezuela s state backed television station venezolana de televisin vtv and depicts a newscaster saying with the triumph of this latin american leader on july  the bolivarian revolution will have a first rate ally in the continent to confront international attack venezuela ha become an aphorism for the fear of many mexican voter though lpez obrador ha consistently denied any formal tie to venezuela the video looked like proof of a connection the clip spread fast avils ha   million follower on facebook and by march th it had racked up more than   view the video looked like proof of a foreign connection but something wa off the logo weren t from vtv and the video timestamps read  pm a slot when vtv doesn t broadcast news for discerning observer all the sign were there the clip shared by avils wasn t a vtv clip but instead a strange amalgamation of video audio and fabricated graphic from three separate source it wa in other word a piece of fake news with mexico s election on the horizon weeding out fake news in the country of  million ha never been more pressing mexican have long distrusted the press and for good reason for decade the national news medium here consisted of two television network and a handful of newspaper all propped up financially by the controlling institutional revolutionary party pri coverage of the government wa favorable and negative story were buried when the government wanted to announce something it came out over televisa say esteban illades editor of the mexican magazine nexos and author of the recent book fake news una nueva realidad it wa very rare to find a version that contradicted the government line in these official news outlet government publicity continues to be an important line item in medium company budget a report by the mexican ngo fundar published in september  found that the government spent   billion between january  and june  on medium advertising and many outlet still report the official version of event without further investigation a bloomberg investigation last fall revealed that politician paid for package of positive story or to suppress negative report fact checking say illades is just starting to permeate mexican newsroom a a result a  poll suggested that more mexican trust the army and the catholic church than the medium social medium and digital outlet have emerged a an important counterbalance to government controlled medium but it also present the risk of mass misinformation mexico is a hub in the spanish speaking world for bot farm in the  presidential campaign now imprisoned colombian hacker andrs seplveda claim to have launched   twitter bot in support of pea nieto s campaign many mexican also get their news from messaging application like whatsapp and news outlet are hard pressed to catch up when chain message spread inaccurate information almost instantaneously a  poll suggested that more mexican trust the army and the catholic church than the medium july st will be the largest election in mexican history voter will be deciding on the makeup of the senate state and local race and voting for a president in term of managing the spread of fake news illades say  is a trial by fire when the video of maduro endorsing lpez obrador went viral verificado  a new mexican fact checking initiative wa just setting up it office in the condesa neighborhood of mexico city verificado  is the brainchild of tania montalvo the editor of the fact checking unit at digital medium outlet animal poltico with funding from google and facebook verificado  ha hired  journalist and data analyst to work full time for the duration of the presidential campaign they have a clear mission to confront two phenomenon on the one hand fake news and on the other the candidate impossible promise and unsubstantiated critique according to the website verificado  partner with local paper across the country ranging from el diario de yucatn in southeastern mexico to the national television and print behemoth milenio in the vein of electionland in the state the team fact check viral story and the candidate claim in debate and speech verificado  ha fact checked story ranging from pope francis speaking out against lpez obrador false to candidate ricardo anaya speaking in favor of the border wall false to the first lady of zacatecas praying for the country not to become a socialist dictatorship true a the maduro clip spread across facebook the verificado  team reached out to video expert and venezuelan television journalist to help analyze it jorge rams the audience editor at verificado  say that a few obvious error tipped them off that the video wa fake the logo wa placed wrong and in other technical aspect it didn t match up to what vtv broadcast he say venezuelan journalist noted that the broadcast supposedly aired at  pm a time slot when vtv doe not broadcast news it appears that the video wa fabricated by pasting an audio recording over video footage made in mexico combined with lifted vtv logo verificado  revealed that the pro lpez obrador subtitle and image of the candidate had been pasted onto an unrelated broadcast on march th verificado  published an explainer debunking the video the explainer wa then reprinted by numerous partner news outlet avils removed the video and a radio program that he appears on la maldita hora issued an apology saying they never intended to deliberately spread false information on our platform keeping up with the steady flow of fake news is a constant challenge in january another viral video spread across facebook supposedly depicting a russia today rt tv broadcaster announcing that the kremlin wa also supporting lpez obrador verificado  sought out a russian translator and subsequently revealed that the pro lpez obrador subtitle and image of the candidate had been pasted onto an unrelated broadcast which wa in fact from the channel rossiya  despite verificado  s best effort digital right activist warn that the threat of misinformation is only growing de escndalo esto no tiene nada de falso todo pic twitter com wjrmamo aj espaol ajplusespanol march   alberto escorcia ha tracked twitter trend in mexico since  on his website lo que sigue and he currently report on bot for buzzfeed mxico he say that like in the state organized network of paid social medium user amplify fake story these network are a tool to destabilize country and to change election he told the verge over skype he s lived outside mexico for a year due to violent threat for his work facebook and twitter have taken more proactive step to combat the spread of fake news since trump s election but escorcia say that their effort fall short in developing country in his experience the most robust troll and cyborg network exist in honduras and mexico the rule from twitter aren t enough escorcia say an attack must line up exactly with what the rule prohibit for them to take down the account he explains how politician enlist social medium in disinformation campaign a politician go to a middleman who then contract a public relation agency specialized in social network manipulation the agency offer different portfolio of social network profile to promote message in favor of the politician or one critical of his opponent payment are made in cash these interaction are semi clandestine so it s hard to find a paper trail he say the same structure ha been documented in investigative report by adn poltico and univisin escorcia say the group are effective because they have an eager low wage labor pool the condition in our country or a country like bangladesh or vietnam lead many jobless people to get involved in this business escorcia explains montalvo of verificado  say that facebook ha been just a integral to the spread of fake news with page disguised a news outlet publishing a mix of true and false story one such page diario de oaxaca ha over   follower even a fake story published on diario de oaxaca that is downgraded through facebook s third party fact checking of which verificado  is a part can reach thousand of people then there s whatsapp which allows user to create group with hundred of member chain message about the election are circulating over whatsapp group with no mechanism to trace the origin of the information the center for international medium assistance recently wrote that while facebook and twitter receive more attention private dark social messenger including signal telegram and whatsapp may be all the more to blame for the viral spread of disinformation which is nearly impossible to track or counter once it is being circulated the condition in our country or a country like bangladesh or vietnam lead many jobless people to get involved in this business verificado  ha opened a whatsapp account to receive report of election related chain message but it acknowledges that it s the hardest platform to track observer doubt that fake news will sway the election or upend lpez obrador s expected victory lpez obrador currently ha a double digit lead and mexico s presidential election is determined by plurality nonetheless fake news ha amplified the polarization between lpez obrador s supporter and his detractor escorcia worry that even if lpez obrador win by a significant percentage orchestrated social medium campaign could provoke violence during the post election period he point to an incident in january  during the gasolinazo when the government announced an increase in gas price a people took to the street in protest bot pushed the hashtag saqueaunwalmart loot a walmart which became a trending topic in mexico city on january rd the hashtag then circulated over whatsapp setting off fear of widespread looting hundred of business closed early and people took shelter but only a handful of store were actually looted escorcia considers this a combined operation where a fabricated story online provokes reaction in the street he envisions a similar situation playing out if lpez obrador is elected bot and human actor inciting panic during the inauguration for example i think it s going to get ugly on election day say escorcia bot aren t just used for political propaganda they can be used to repress and stop resistance,,,0,0,0,ied blast in kashmir  km from pulwama terror attack spot  no casualty  hindustan

5,ive watched my mother host  thanksgiving this roughly equates to a collective  guest a metric half ton of turkey and enough gravy to flood the chicago suburb anyone who can estimate the overall caloric intake deserves the nobel prize a midwestern thanksgiving is a special thing a so much of a host energy must be spent anticipating and accommodating a wide range of potentiality take the weather my own lifetime ha seen thanksgiving day range from  to  degree fahrenheit a spread that allows for both slushy boot and sunburn yes sunburnswere irish okay irish also mean accommodating a crowd thats ranged from  to  guest sometimes cousin bring date sometimes the baby are kept at home a differential of three table of diner and on any given year the crowd age range might span four generation and eight decade meaning that both accessibility and entertainment become heightened component of the operation ive watched my mother every year a she performs this seamless calculus and have absorbed what i hope is some secondhand prowess hosting a midwestern gathering is a deeply gratifying exercise you just have to think like a guest to do it right a a gift to the most entertaining averse among you here are some prized learning from my family hearth and home to yours  establish a debooting zone you never want to tell guest exactly what to do but a big rug on the front porch piled high with others snow caked uggs and wellies might send the message that youre not too jazzed on all that sludge tracking through the house besides who can get comfy while bound to wet heavy footwear which brings u to the next tenet  enact a b y o s policy thats bring your own slipper not a an enforced rule or anything just start the trend by showing up to family party with cozy footwear in tow it both a courtesy and a compliment you keep the host floor slush free and show them just how comfortable youre made by their hospitality the trend will gain traction among your cousin and youll be in fuzzy slipper all night everyone win  get creative with the overflow seating piano bench and ottoman not only fulfill their duty a extra chair but also seem to delight the younger kid who will all scramble to fill those seat first maybe forking up mashed potato from these tiny upholstered pouf throne provides a transgressive thrill  deploy every possible tactic for keeping guest out of the kitchen cooler full of beer water and soda back porch wine glassware and corkscrew on the sideboard appetizer living room coat on the bed in the guest bedroom trash recycling next to the sideboard or in the hallway or in the laundry room or out back brought a dish of your own the hostess will take that to the fridge for you you just worry about getting yourself some chicken dip which is far away in the living room guest seem preternaturally attracted to the kitchen and tend to drift toward it until the room is so packed that new arrival must fold into the paper thin crevice of free space that remain it both a nuisance and a fire code violation and if left unchecked these crowd will cause the kitchen to swell and burst into a shower of splintered wood smashed brick and stainless steel shrapnel if you want thanksgiving dinner to materialize you need room to open your oven and so youve got to keep everyone out of the kitchen by supplying almost no incentive to head there almost because of course theyre going to want to say hello to the head chef  embrace culinary cacophony there a debate that rage in the far corner of foodie internet should dinner party guest be invited to contribute dish of their own or will this disrupt the harmonious composition of the meal the host ha planned i bite my thumb at the latter camp at least when it come to thanksgiving dinner it a time for belly bursting comfort not culinary mastery there going to be an excess of everything salty side starchy main sickly sweet salad made primarily of marshmallow the dessert will be disproportionately chocolate and beverage offering include beer wine and bailey thanksgiving is a day for family whomever we embrace a such and there nothing you wouldnt do for familyeven if that mean forgoing an interesting new recipe because you know it wont play a well a the cranberry sauce youve made every year since   also enact a b y o t policy bring your own tupperware in the interest of letting not one spoonful go to waste guest should feel free to arrive armed with plastic tub aplenty to fill up with their favorite a they head out the door alternatively a host can take this opportunity to get rid of the many reusable thai container that have accumulated in their cabinet over the past year  then do it all over again my mom little stroke of genius the black friday meal invite family and friend to head over after any potential shopping spree for a lazy casual afternoon complete with platter of reheated leftover and a yet unsliced dessert because no holiday ought to last a single measly day there are many more trick up this midwestern sleeve serving hot appetizer in one of these placing a dining table directly in front of the couch so diehard neednt pull themselves away from football and so on but the only indispensable advice is this make thanksgiving what you want it to be cling to the tradition that delight you and not a single one that doesnt define family and dinner table and saying grace and side salad however loosely befits your holiday i promise your guest wont leave feeling burned by the discord of multiple cheesy potato side they

but it wa not until the year leading up to  when the hughes corporation put together the final piece of it purchase of the woodland that the housing market caught up with the plan houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem a shortage of housing on the high end of the market touching off the surge in demand wa an announcement by exxon that it wa opening a new corporate campus in nearby spring exxon wa far from alone a a growing list of company relocated to the area so did ten of thousand of worker drawn by the boom in fracking technology that none other than mr mitchell and colleague had coaxed tweaked and perfected over nearly  year that influx would have all but saturated the existing home market said bill gilmer director of the institute for regional forecasting at the university of houston it drove a spike in land price allowing developer to consider new construction on relatively low cost lot that previously would have been too costly to improve this would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvement and still come out ahead mr gilmer said fema map of the woodland showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called spring creek including acreage in the  plan building right along the creek would have been out of the question but farther south portion of the land were slightly above the  year flood plain according to the map those who knew the land and it history saw warning sign nick rife whose family owned land in the area said he used to hunt there when it wasn t flooded by bringing in thousand of dump truck load of dirt it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain making the whole area suitable for construction that is exactly what the woodland decided to do document show the former edge of the flood plain run through what are now the lot of m martinez and mr hickey the longtime woodland resident who once worked for mr mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood on the strip of land containing wood drake place m martinez s street   cubic yard of dirt were laid down fema approved a map change for that area on feb   document show the large extrusion of development around lake reverie place mr hickey s street and the nearby sundown ridge place got   cubic yard of dirt on june   fema approved a map change for what would become lot for the  home in those area the result neighborhood that seemed safe from flooding when esteban and paola seaez moved into their home next to spring creek in  their

to check again we see that the flood plain wa revised recently the agent said so for a bargain rate of   per year the soeders became one of the family in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance

more aggressive policy since the howard hughes corporation a brand revived in  by the activist investor bill ackman took over mr hickey dug into damage statistic and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rate than others in the woodland in older part of the community his research revealed about  out of   home flooded during harvey or le than  percent a

16,you can see it on satellite imagery a chaotic blur of wind and water shaped like a giant alien starfish over australia extending a tentacle diagonally across the pacific and right into the golden gate it s called an atmospheric river over a thousand mile of water and wind this weekend is going to be a wet a an entire typical april on the official scale the storm will probably top out at strong it might have enough water vapor transport to rate a extreme but probably won t reach exceptional the real freak out level of flood danger that mean several inch of rain this is how california get most of it disastrous flood but also most of it drinking water it s a crazy way to do business but understanding these atmospheric river might be the key to making sure the human race doesn t die of thirst atmospheric river come ashore on nearly every west facing coastline on earth a few time a year one of them doe what this weekend s storm will do shotgun over hawaii and into northern california it tail all the way back into the tropic almost to the date line say michael anderson the california state climatologist it s going to come through pretty quick onshore the fast wet air from one of these so called pineapple express ricochet upward off the coastal mountain range like a tennis ball catching the top of the net the air rise the water fall that s called orographic enhancement and it s how you get massive burst of rain and flood somewhere between  and  percent of california s entire water supply come from atmospheric river storm and they are intense in one study of six year of california rainfall monitored hour by hour just   hour qualified a atmospheric river storm but that scant   percent of time accounted for over  percent of the rainfall the researcher measured california hoard more than half of that rain a snowfall on the top of the sierra the rest it try to save in reservoir a dozen big one and about  littler one scattered up and down the state in the rainy winter month the reservoir fill up ideally leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer ideally during the winter all the reservoir stay empty enough to absorb flood wave from storm but on april  that reserve space start being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt anderson say with a storm this time of year you still have that flood reserve space so there s room for the reservoir to catch that water the question will be a that reserve space is being relaxed can that water be kept for the conservation pool it s a balance hold onto water for a rain free summer and possible drought be ready to capture snowmelt but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season every reservoir ha a rule curve that say how much water is too much but atmospheric river can make it tough to know when to apply those rule in november and december of  the lake mendocino reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river event enough so that the water encroached into the flood pool which is supposed to stay empty for emergency so the reservoir operator released the water it wa the prudent thing to do say f martin ralph a research meteorologist at uc san diego s scripps institution of oceanography but nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric river basically for the rest of the year and that wa the beginning of the drought they never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring so ralph along with the sonoma county water agency which regulates the drinking water in lake mendocino the u army corp of engineer which operates the flood prevention aspect of the reservoir and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which monitor the salmon fishery that s part of the lake s hydrology are all working on a finer grained system it s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric river coming a few day ahead so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily and every day looking at the forecast to see if there s an atmospheric river ralph say if there s not the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero the idea s still in a planning stage ralph s group is now trying these forecast informed reservoir operation at mendocino and prado in southern california it s still status quo ante at other reservoir like like oroville where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year s rain but if the new approach work and so far it seems like it may reservoir can keep the water for a not rainy day that day may be coming or it might not water in the american west wa variable and unpredictable even before human started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it d change the climate a warmer atmosphere hold more water vapor that by itself would strengthen atmospheric river but a warmer atmosphere mean warmer pole which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the end that mean weaker wind and weaker ar however there s a big asterisk on that it s inevitable that some storm will be just a strong in term of wind a they are today and they will have available to them more water vapor ralph say there could be a class of atmospheric river storm that are a lot stronger than we ve seen in the past ralph s idea for managing reservoir better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate and not just in california the northwestern u get a quarter to a third of it annual rainfall from atmospheric river and they cause flood there too arizona s and idaho s big winter flood are often due to atmospheric river a few year ago one even caused major flooding in nashville they are the driver of flood and drought around the world so understanding those ocean spanning tendril on satellite map may be the solution to what s arguably going to be humanity s most pressing problem figuring out what to do

29,conspiracy theory are dusted amid the violent video racist comment and death threat that facebook moderator face every day that putrid flood of information can be traumatic a the verge s casey newton found when he reported on the working condition endured by moderator in phoenix arizona some of the worker bombarded with conspiracy theory told newton that they were starting to believe the idea they were seeing what make people start believing that the earth is flat or that   wasn t a terrorist attack and in this case did the stressful working condition have anything to do with it to answer some of those question we turned to mike wood wood a psychologist at the university of winchester study conspiracy theory and how they spread from the fringe to the mainstream the verge spoke to wood about the current research into conspiracy theory and whether there s anything people can do to make themselves le susceptible to them this interview ha been lightly edited for clarity you ve done quite a bit of research into conspiracy theory can we start with the basic what exactly is a conspiracy theory i m not going to look into whether it s true or not that everybody in the government is a lizard person we re going to start off real complicated right off the bat nobody can agree on this if you ask different people in different academic field they re going to give you different answer a a psychologist i m not going to look into whether it s true or not that everybody in the government is a lizard person i m just interested in why people would accept or reject that idea so for me a conspiracy theory is a secret plot by powerful people or organization working together to advance some kind of sinister goal through deception if you ask other people they ll give you other definition like a philosopher would say that a conspiracy theory is any theory about a conspiracy which i think is probably too broad and doesn t fit how most people would use the term in the verge s recent article on facebook moderator the fact that these worker started believing in the conspiracy theory video that they were being asked to moderate really stood out to reader is that propagation by exposure something that you ve seen before in your conspiracy theory research how do these thing spread the exposure aspect is interesting in this case we ve got some data on this from   conspiracy theory showing that one of the big predictor of whether or not somebody will believe a particular conspiracy theory is how much they ve been exposed to it conspiracy theory can be appealing to people for a lot of reason the problem is that this is all cross sectional data we just have one point in time and we know that the people who believe these theory have more exposure to them than the people that don t we don t know if that s because they believe them and then they seek them out because they want to know more or if they saw this stuff and then that convinced them of it it sound like this might be a case where people were exposed to it for long period of time and that actually induced them to believe in it so there s a causal aspect to this that we haven t had in the research before but there are other study where people do these experiment where you get people to read a conspiracy theory passage a little passage about how princess diana wa secretly killed by queen elizabeth and you can see that that ha some influence on people it change how they think about the issue in the short term at least we certainly see those effect but this is an interesting sort of long term exposure effect that we saw in these moderator other research ha shown that being exposed to fact doesn t seem to change people s mind do we know why people being exposed to conspiracy theory in particular make people believe them exposing people to information is going to affect them in some way or another we all like to think that we re immune to this stuff but it doe have an effect i don t know that conspiracy theory have a uniquely powerful effect to them where conspiracy theory can seduce people is when you have a conspiracy theory that is very appealing to you on the basis of other thing that you believe we all like to think that we re immune to this stuff let s say that you re a huge supporter of donald trump and you come across a conspiracy theory that say all of the people who are his rival his political enemy people that he doesn t like are all super evil and are working together to engage in satanic child sacrifice this is something that perhaps would appeal to you because of the other thing that you believe it wouldn t appeal to somebody who doesn t like donald trump at all and is probably quite ok with his enemy just being normal people it ha to be congruent to some extent with the other thing you already believe but conspiracy theory can be appealing to people for a lot of reason it could be because it make sense of something that they had trouble to coming to grip with before it could be a way of dealing with some type of uncertainty feeling like they have lost control with what s happening to them or a rationalization of some failure they ve had or some defeat their side ha suffered in an election the other aspect of this story wa the mental health effect of watching horrific video all the time would stress play a role in this kind of thing if they re being exposed to stressful video and then have conspiracy video thrown in yeah there is some work on this conspiracy theory do associate with stress basically there s been some research that s showed that when people undergo a stressful life event something like death of a family member divorce major disruption to their life conspiracy theory are more likely in that circumstance so there is some indication that psychological stress can put people in this place where they re looking around for new answer or they re possibly trying to come to grip with the world in a new way we ve got other research showing that when someone doesn t feel in control of their life or in control of what s happening to them conspiracy theory seem more plausible and that might have been what s happening with these people i m not sure what their subjective psychological experience wa at the time but there is some data that suggests that can happen conspiracy theory have been around for a long time but social medium is a relatively new invention in the span of human history how ha it changed the way conspiracy theory spread it s made them a lot more visible for sure if you would read the local newspaper  year ago you wouldn t have the comment section at the bottom saying this is all lie and that s what they want you to think but if you read a lot of local news now or you go to social medium or your twitter feed you ll see that that s a big change i think the information doesn t spread in such a top down way a it did before there s always going to be a hierarchy of how information get out there but to an extent it s more democratized now given that we are online constantly whether for job or social life is there any way to combat or insulate yourself from these kind of misinformation or conspiracy theory or is it just part of the ecosystem now it s hard to not come across it at all i would say there are step that you can take to make sure that the information that you re getting is a good a it can be a lot of that is just finding reliable source of information and making sure that you re not classifying it a reliable just because it flatters what you already believe because again that s where a lot of conspiracy theory come from they play off preconception that people have and make them more vivid there are study showing that if you get people to think carefully about thing and not just go with their gut they re going to be le convinced of conspiracy theory conspiracy theory tend to have a much easier time finding purchase in your mind if you have a very intuitive approach to something if you just say ah that sound right that feel right to me that s when conspiracy theory are going to be most convincing to you it s really easy to believe crap because crap is appealing people can go with their gut feeling because they are distracted or preoccupied or don t have time to look into everything nobody ha enough time to look into everything you just have to find people who are good thinker and figure stuff out and try to do it yourself a much a you can and put in the effort how much effort doe it take for our brain to push back on our gut it take effort for sure it s really easy to believe crap because crap is appealing in a lot of way you can get into this default mode where you settle on your ideology or you settle on you belief and you don t critically reflect on it and that s very easy to do fighting against that is difficult and it feel terrible sometimes but it s what you have to do in order to make sense of the world and

34,the worst disaster in california s history wasn t an earthquake or a fire or a drought it wa a flood that killed thousand wiped out mine and ranch and submerged the state capital sacramento for  day starting in december  california wa inundated today hardly anyone think about the floodwaters that turned california s central valley into a vast lake but it will happen again it s not a question of if but when writes seismologist and disaster expert lucy jones in her new book the big one how natural disaster h ave shaped u and what we can do about them that s why it s key for u to know about the disaster in our history so that we re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale after all more than  time a many people now live in california a did during that deluge jones writes what s at risk in disaster is not our individual life it s the future of our community while natural hazard are inevitable the destruction they wreak is not jones say in an interview with the verge we can make choice about how we handle that but we have to think ahead she say working at the u geological survey jones led a team of scientist who investigated the potential catastrophe in california s future one of them wa a flood and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategy would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in  the disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous san andreas fault after  year at the usgs jones retired and opened the dr lucy jones center for science and society which aim to boost community resilience using science in her book she lay out catastrophic disaster in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed pompeii to hurricane katrina to the tohoku quake in japan in  she tell both the scientific story of how disaster unfolded and the human story of the community they struck we have to think ahead her goal is to teach reader about disaster by drawing them in with narrative and to address the way human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future most of u assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller one we ve experienced which can make u overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophe something expert call normalization bias our tendency to focus on more immediate threat can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant one which make sense jones say if you worry about the  year flood and not about the wolf that s about to eat your child your dna doe not get passed down she draw on her experience a a scientist and a a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquake the verge spoke with jones about natural hazard risk assessment and the disaster that haunt her this interview ha been edited for clarity and brevity i grew up in california and only learned about the   flood last year how do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh and make sure that people don t forget that this could happen again photo by helen berger dr lucy jones it s very difficult to do in a natural world if we hadn t built all of our flood control system we would have smaller flood much more often when you have the smaller one at least you know that flooding is a risk but you do tend to believe that the risk is what you ve already dealt with so paradoxically the flood manager who were fully aware of the  flood seemed more willing to say we ve got it covered that isn t really going to happen again and like with earthquake i find that the people were actually part of a response to northridge a quake that hit part of the los angeles area in  are much more overconfident about their ability to handle the really big one because they feel like they dealt with the really big one and that that wasn t the really big one doesn t get through hundred of year ago we didn t have the information to be able to think ahead now we have more information and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it because it doesn t seem real to u and that right there is the challenge of natural disaster we know what they re going to do we know how to build to avoid the damage but everything about human nature keep u from looking forward for that really long term planning so it requires much more rational logical thought and reasoned discourse so how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past around the world people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before because of globalization and improved telecommunication we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time one of the most striking example of that wa the tohoku earthquake in northern japan in  i m sitting in my living room in california and i can turn on the tv and watch in real time the tsunami wave and we see the people fleeing from it from the air we don t have enough to save them at this point but we watch them in real time suffer through this now around the world people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before i would say fifteen year ago it wa rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami wa but between the indian ocean event in  and japan in  and the really direct emotional experience with the power of telecommunication we have a really different understanding and experience of it and that is allowing u to overcome that normalization bias and it s part of the reason that we ve been able to make progress here in southern california with getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it for u it isn t about tsunami it s mostly about earthquake the book is divided by chapter into case study of different disaster through history which one kept you up at night which one haunted you the  mississippi flood the greatest flood disaster in american history mississippi is a huge river system that drain the majority of american state a huge rainfall starting in the fall of  through winter and spring led to failure of the levee protecting the land around the mississippi river and   square mile were flooded and over  million people were flooded out of their home over   people were living in refugee camp what really haunted me wa seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizen but what really haunted me about it and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write wa seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizen what happened to african american victim of the flood wa appalling and just the inhumanity of how they were treated the kanto earthquake which wa only four year before that wa also in japan an equally horrible turning on neighbor and it wa recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it wa the victim s fault to blame the victim because if it wa the victim s fault then i can protect myself by not making those same mistake it s a subconscious response to fear i don t want that to be able to happen to me so you find reason that it s the victim s fault and at the worst level you then punish the victim of the situation so when you ask what haunted me i m an earth scientist so the physical part of it wa all what i understood and expected going in what haunted me and inspired wa sometimes the horribleness of human response and sometimes the real inspiration of human response and you see both in those story the book talk about the disconnect between the language scientist use and the language the public use s to talk about disaster scientist have their wind speed for hurricane magnitude for earthquake probability for flood then the public asks wa it the big one how do we bridge that gap and do we need to i just see people talking past each other so much the stuff i put in this book none of it is really hard to understand a high schooler could easily read the book and understand it maybe even somebody younger and yet we don t teach it and therefore the public doesn t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion so we need better education in science which doe not mean learning a bunch of fact the other part is to understand how to think about science the fundamental of science a a process for learning what s really true we don t teach that but then we also need to help the scientist understand that people are looking for a mix they want the science but they also want the human side of it and we need to help the scientist do a better job of being to answer the human question i just see people talking past each other so much you write about how being a seismologist give you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen sometime in the next millennium sound not like an evasion but like a threat how ha this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk are you resigned to it or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is the earthquake s absolutely inevitable but chance of it in my lifetime the earthquake s absolutely inevitable but the chance of it in my lifetime well the san andreas is probably going to have an earthquake in my lifetime but the fault i live near probably isn t so yes it s a possibility but i just have to keep it balanced because it s a relatively low possibility compared to other thing people assume that where i live must be a place that s really safe from earthquake but we moved to a community with really good school sitting right on top of a significant fault we were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn t happen before the kid got out of high school and it worked climate change is going to make meteorological disaster more frequent and more devastating right what do we need to do to make sure that we re prepared it s going to be very difficult people do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this we need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what s already there if it s at all possible because more heat in the atmosphere doesn t just mean it s warmer and oh i guess i can handle that that mean more energy to drive storm and they are going to be getting worse that doesn t stop the hurricane from getting stronger so first off we ve got to admit it we can t talk about nuisance flooding because high tide is bringing it into your house without thinking about what that mean when the hurricane come through one of the big issue in america is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land right nobody get to tell you what to do with your own land we are really struggling a a society to be able to make those big scale decision we need to be changing our attitude about community how much we share to accept that we re dependent on the decision of others we don t like to do that a american either we so prize our independence so we philosophically oppose that but that doesn t change what s going to happen that doesn t stop the hurricane from getting stronger if there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book what is it you have choice that hazard are inevitable and the disaster is not we a a society have choice both what we do individually but also a choice to work together the thing that came out of it for me is that what s at risk in disaster is not our individual life it s the future of our community and we can change that if we can work together a a community,,,1,1,1,avalanche hand sloppy maple leaf another home loss  tsn

40,google is hosting it annual cloud next developer conference in san francisco this week while the event is still in full swing with a mystery concert capping off most of the programming tonight the flood of news ha now subsided so here is our list of the most important announcement from the event anthos what is it anthos is the new name of the google cloud service platform google s managed service for allowing enterprise to run application in their private data center and in google s cloud google decided to give the service a new name anthos but also expanded support to aws and azure it competitor cloud platform this will allow enterprise to use a single platform running on google s cloud to deploy and manage their application on any cloud enterprise will get a single bill and have a single dashboard to manage their application all of this unsurprisingly is powered by container and kubernetes why doe it matter it s still highly unusual for the big cloud competitor to launch a product that allows user to run application on other platform the money after all is in charging fee for compute time and storage allocation google argues that this is something it customer want and that it solves a real problem google however is also chasing it competitor and looking for way to differentiate it approach from them i don t think we ll see aws and azure react with similar tool but if they do it s a good thing for their customer open source integration into the google cloud console what is it google announced that it would deeply integrate the product of a number of open source company into it cloud and essentially make them first party service these partner are confluent datastax elastic influxdata mongodb neoj and redis lab with others likely to follow over time why doe it matter these integration are a boon for google cloud customer who are likely already using some of these service they ll get a single bill and access to support from these company all while managing the service from a single console the subtext here though is a bit more complicated and reveals google s approach to open source and put it into contrast with aws many of the company that are participating here are highly critical of aws s treatment of open source and quite public about it google is working with them while the perception is that aws simply us the code and doesn t give back google s ai platform what is it google see it ai prowess a one of it main differentiator in it fight against aws azure and co the company already offered a wide range of ai tool ranging from developer tool and service for advanced data scientist to automl a service that can automatically train model and doesn t require a phd the new ai platform offer an end to end solution for more advanced developer that allows them to go from ingesting data to training and testing their model to putting them into production the platform can also use pre built model why doe it matter ai and machine learning is the major focus for all big cloud provider but the developer experience leaf lot of room for improvement having an end to end solution is obviously a major step forward here and open up the promise of machine learning to a wider range of potential user your android phone is now a security key what is it instead of using a physical security key to enable two factor authentication you ll now be able to use any android  phone a a security key too you set it up in your google account and your phone will then use bluetooth but without the hassle of creating a bluetooth connection to provide your second factor for now this only work with chrome but google hope to turn this into a standard that other browser and mobile operating system vendor will also support google also recommends you still use a regular key a a backup for that inevitable day when you lose your phone why it matter two factor authentication is inherently safer than just using a login and password system that use sm and push notification are still vulnerable to phishing attack while security key and this new android based system us the same standard a existing key prevent this by ensuring that you are on a legitimate site this new system take the hassle out of using a physical key and may just convince more people to use two factor authentication google cloud code what is it cloud code is a set of plugins and extension for popular ide s like intellij and v code the general idea here is to provide developer with all of the necessary tool to build cloud native application all without having to deal with any of the plumbing work and configuration that come with that using cloud code developer can simply write their application like before but then package them a cloud native apps and ship them to a kubernetes cluster for testing or production why doe it matter writing cloud native apps is complicated and usually involves writing complex configuration file cloud code ideally make all of this so easy that it ll be far easier for developer and the company that employ them to make this move to a modern infrastructure google cloud aim at retailer what is it the news here is that google is launching a vertical solution that s squarely aimed at retailer that doesn t sound all that earth shattering doe it but google cloud plan to offer more of these specialized solution over time why doe it matter google cloud ceo thomas kurian told u that customer are asking for these kind of integrated solution that package some of the company existing tool into integrated solution that these enterprise can deploy this is essentially the first time it is doing so with maybe the exception of healthcare but it ll likely offer more of these over time and they could become a major factor in growing the platform s user base bonus we also got a chance to sit down with google cloud s new ceo thomas kurian to put some of the announcement into context and talk about his vision for google cloud going forward,,,0,0,1,boy    survives avalanche that buried him for  minute

the early day of the development of mapping and weather prediction technology and got their start in the business co founding zeus a weather prediction technology developer that wa pitching it service to commodity trader zeus wa way too early from a technology platform perspective say hacker we put zeus on the shelf eight year ago then when we came up with the idea for jupiter most of the early idea were already there in the interim hacker served a the president of kaggle a company google acquired back in  by that point hacker had already left to launch jupiter which he started in  while zeus predicted the thirty day weather for commodity trader jupiter is a more powerful toolkit that predicts the possibility of damage from severe weather and climate change for a much broader set of customer hacker say wun and sorkin were on board immediately and the next person to join the fledgling team wa hacker who had run satellite operation for skybox another google acquisition following the merger of skybox with planet lab hacker took a job at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration within the department of commerce one of the pre eminent organization focused on climate

granularity and insight into the kind of threat climate and weather related disaster post to government and private asset we predict probabilistically at the asset level at the loading dock of a warehouse or a transmission box or a hotel on the beach we determine the actual expected risk in a form that the insurance industry or the risk manager at an organization can use and integrate into their plan say sorkin the company s process begin with global climate model and then drill down into a specific region which is used a the basis of predicting peril like event according to sorkin that go into a statistical model which translate the prediction into a form that quantifies the uncertainty and in a way that s tailored to decision maker he said using apis from mapbox the company can also provide a mapping interface that give customer visualization along with a product that let user see what damage can look like inside of a building through virtual reality and a collaboration with oculus the strategy wa to start with one peril in one place in one market so we started with flooding in carolina for the real estate say sorkin we have expanded into much broader peril and geography and market segment for all of the time that sorkin spends modeling out how city will meet their doom in one form of cataclysm or another jupiter s chief executive is fairly positive about the prospect

50,after intensifying overnight hurricane michael is now pummeling the florida panhandle a a category  storm the strongest hurricane on record to ever strike the region hundred of thousand of people have been ordered to evacuate a michael s wind top speed of  mile per hour nbc news report storm surge is expected to bring flood water reaching  foot high and already there are life threatening storm surge and catastrophic wind moving on shore the national hurricane center say for those who stayed put it s time to seek shelter out of the way of wave and wind florida governor rick scott warned on twitter the time for evacuating along the coast ha come and gone an extreme wind warning is currently in effect for location between laguna beach and eastpoint until  pm et wind gust in excess of  mph are expected shelter in place immediately hurricanemichael pic twitter com jogpnwmwtv nw tallahassee nwstallahassee october   the storm is unusually strong because of a few thing warm water in the gulf favorable wind condition and humidity those are the perfect ingredient for a storm like this to really blossom say marshall shepherd director of the university of georgia s atmospheric science program and former president of the american meteorological society it s possible the storm could get stronger still before landfall the national hurricane center say and after hurricane michael hit shepherd doubt we ll see a hurricane with the same name again it s a life altering society altering situation he say storm of this magnitude and impact the name is typically retired and i fully expect this to be the case for michael the verge spoke with shepherd about hurricane michael s unprecedented strength this interview ha been edited for clarity and brevity how did hurricane michael get so strong overnight it s really blossomed into a category  and the primary reason are that it wa moving into very warm water which is somewhat unusual for this late in october it moved into a very favorable upper wind situation where there wa not very much wind shear and there s a lot of moisture in the eastern united state out ahead of a cold front that s coming from the west when michael wa further south it wa in a very difficult wind shear environment a you know hurricane don t like wind shear when the wind change direction or speed a you go up in altitude one of the thing that s really interesting about hurricane michael is that it wa very resilient it wa actually still intensifying even in an environment with a lot of wind shear which wa odd so i knew once it got into an environment with le wind shear and over warm gulf water the thing wa going to just explode and that s what we re seeing from space satellite from nasaearth noaa see hurricanemichael a a major hurricane in the gulf of mexico our latest space view http t co bvwmvayu latest storm weather from nw http t co qkxrndk be prepared fema resource http t co qcgbnvwh pic twitter com wfhovkgbu nasa nasa october   is there anything else that can explain how michael intensified so rapidly we ve been seeing these hot tower these tall thunderstorm that form in the eyewall of the hurricane i ve been talking about these since my day a a scientist at nasa because there are study that show that when you have these hot tower they re more likely to indicate that the storm will go through a rapid intensification phase because they re releasing so much heat that all that water vapor is condensing into cloud water in the storm when water vapor condenses to form cloud water it release this burst of heat called latent heat that s really the fuel supply for these hurricane heat engine when you have these hot tower they re like the supercharged piston in the engine if you will you ve got this ample warm water you ve got not a lot of wind shear overnight when the storm really intensified so you can have a very efficient engine where all this water vapor is being converted to energy what sort of hazard can we expect from the hurricane if it stay at this intensity and there s evidence that it s even still intensifying at this moment this is going to be the strongest storm at least on record to ever hit this part of florida i think a lot of time we can overemphasize or over play the wind threat in a hurricane i don t think that s the case with this one there s going to be significant wind impact not only at the landfall point and around the panhandle of florida because the storm is so large it s so strong and because of the pace that it s moving even inland in part of alabama and georgia there are going to be hurricane strength wind so the wind are going to be a significant impact the storm surge could be record breaking in the coastal region to the right of the storm we could be seeing record eight to  perhaps more foot of storm surge we can t downplay the rain it s not going to be a situation like harvey and florence where the thing stall out and dump three or four foot of rain but there still could be half a foot to a foot of rainfall and then of course to the right of the storm a it move into georgia and the carolina you ll get the tornado threat too it s a horrible situation is it late in the year to be seeing a hurricane in the gulf i thought we were past the peak of hurricane season keep in mind with water it take several month for the transition from cold to warm and warm to cold even though air temperature are starting to cool down the heat characteristic of water mean that the water ha residual warmth for a while that s why the peak of the hurricane season is typically in september even though the actual hurricane season start in june so there s this lag so the water are gradually starting to cool down from that peak in september but they re still typically warm enough to support hurricane we get hurricane all of the time in october that s not unprecedented and frankly when we do get october hurricane they form exactly where michael formed which is down in the southern caribbean and moving into the gulf this is exactly what we expect from an october hurricane i m just cautioning that there is nothing particularly unique about a hurricane in october that take this particular track but yes it certainly is interesting that it ha tapped into enough warm water to explosively develop how is climate change contributing to hurricane michael s intensification storm like this are undoubtedly pushing more water into the coast because sea level are higher so when we have these type of storm and storm surge the storm will be pushing a higher level of water than it would  or  year ago that is something that i m very comfortable saying but i think only the study over time will play out whether the warmer ocean because of our broader background climate change are fueling more higher octane storm physically we understand that that should be the case i want to clarify that we understand from a scientific standpoint that a warming climate is causing warmer ocean and you would think from a physic understanding of how these storm work that would lead to more intense storm whether i can say conclusively that that s why this particular storm is more intense i just think it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on that what s your advice to people in the area it s almost too late if you re in florida to do anything people should have been gone a day or two ago if they stayed in all we can do is pray and hope that they re okay a the storm move further inland i am concerned that people further inland in my state of georgia for example may not be really aware of the fact that they re going to experience strong tropical storm to weak hurricane force wind in some part well inland i think that might catch a few people off guard so hopefully they re prepared for long power outage perhaps tree falling down on their home or in their yard and for georgia i m even worried about crop damage that part of georgia is a very agriculturally intense region of our state it s harvest time for some crop so i even worry about that how fast are we expecting this storm to move through the region this storm is going to move quickly which won t mean four foot of rain like we saw in florence or harvey but the downside of a quick moving storm is that place further inland still feel the impact of a pretty powerful punch from the hurricane because it take a while to weaken this is a very different storm than a florence and a harvey but it carry it own unique threat because of the fact that place inland will see hurricane force wind or strong tropical storm force wind,,,1,1,1, dead in avalanche outside aspen  sheriff
51,the midwest flood continue to be a slow moving disaster town farm and infrastructure are still underwater in nebraska and water will take month to work through the vast network of river creek and stream that drain the upper midwest into the gulf of mexico the damage to the region could last much longer than that though it could require year to rebuild infrastructure but the real challenge will be restoring the region greatest resource the reason there are so many farm there in the first place it soil early estimate indicate the flood could be responsible for   million in crop loss in nebraska which sits at the epicenter of the flood that number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmer off from field and prevent spring planting thats bad news for a state where one in four job are tied to or supported by farming according to the state department of agriculture state next door are dealing with their own varying level of crisis from river overtopping their bank even after the floodwater recedes the region farm and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery spanning year or decade to understand why you have to understand how these flood happened after an extremely wet fall winter arrived with a fury repeated blast of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it then came the bomb cyclone a few week ago it unleashed a blizzard in western nebraska but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lot of it nearly three quarter of nebraska weather station are seeing an increase in winter rain according to climate central full disclosure i helped with this analysis when i worked there a hallmark of the warming world soaked soil couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water and so it began to run off into river and stream scraping the earth away with it add in dam and levee failure and the torrent truly clawed away at the midwest most bountiful resource basically what it going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil mahdi al kaisi a soil and water specialist with iowa state extension program told earther this is why we need to think about climate change more seriously thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surface it not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away where the floodwaters have receded huge block of soil have been gouged away the weight of the water ha also compacted soil in some location while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged river neither of which is a nutrient rich or structured a the soil that support the wheat soybean and corn crop you have the good stuff moving away and not a good stuff moving in andrea basche an agronomist and soil scientist at the university of nebraska told earther that put farmer who depend on growing these crop for their livelihood in a serious bind they can try to plant this year crop knowing productivity wont be a high a it wa or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state the first step is just letting field dry out something that could take week or even month farmer can ass how much sand theyre looking at though al kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessment could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left for those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inch of sand they can just churn it up into the soil but area with more than  inch of sand could be lost cause nebraska extension service suggests that farmer dealing with that situation c onsider the relative cost of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area basche suggested that farmer could also use compost or restore wetland and prairie a other possible solution for rebuilding soil but it still could take decade to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetime again that timeframe could mean many farmer and rancher end up walking away rather than deal with mounting cost or the specter of bankruptcy farm revenue in nebraska while important ha been declining and trump escalating trade war have sapped an estimated  billion from nebraska alone according to the american farm bureau though that number doesnt take into account program designed to offset loss the state of the soil only make the situation more dire all this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the system we rely on al kaisi said in the future farmer could focus on low or no till agriculture and planting cover crop could help mitigate some of the impact of flooding systemic change are also needed including rethinking flood protection a climate change ups the odds of heavy downpour and rain falling on snow it wa not designed to handle this john remus an army corp of engineer manager said in a new york time interview referring to the intricate series of levee and dam that normally hold back the missouri river and the system will only be further taxed in the coming month far from where the flood began this is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season with more than  million people at risk for flooding in their community ed clark director of national oceanic and atmospheric administration national water center said in a statement that went out with the agency spring flood outlook that outlook show that area all along the missouri and mississippi river face major flood risk through may meaning more field will face the scouring power of water we need to be really clear this is not just farmer problem al kaisi said this is society

55,more than  emergency siren blanket the city of san francisco ready to warn local in the event of a flood a fire an earthquake or terrorism and while true emergency are few and far between everyone in the bay area know the siren s racket even if they ve trained their ear to tune it out redolent of an wartime air raid the siren wail precisely at noon each tuesday rising and falling eerily and slowly this is a test a voice follows this is a test of the outdoor warning system this is only a test and thus concludes the tuesday midday siren tradition what the resident don t know is that their siren ha long been vulnerable to attack triggering the sound for malicious or mischievous purpose isn t stupid easy but for a person educated in radio frequency security who ha   to blow at an electronics store there s virtually nothing to stop them from bathing the city in obnoxious tone for hour on end worst still the same vulnerability might very well affect similar emergency system in countless other city university and public utility installation read nuclear power plant two year ago a software engineer originally from australia moved to san francisco from south bay and noticed the siren everywhere he went perched atop pole and often intentionally positioned so a not to adversely affect resident by blocking their view most people wouldn t give it a second thought but the engineer balint seeber just happens to be obsessed with electromagnetic radiation in particular the range of frequency most of u simply refer to a radio examining the siren installed by a company called acoustic technology inc or ati system seeber the director of vulnerability research at bastille network deduced that all were triggered by rf radio frequency and of course they are it would be incredibly inefficient to do it any other way why on earth would the city run mile and mile of electric cable to over a  point in the city when sweet wireless radio is so cheap and easy to use before customer panic too much please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do with access to a specially licensed frequency there s virtually nothing to impede the signal sent once a week by the city s emergency management department what s more test signal not intended to trigger the siren can be sent just a easily ensuring that the system is on standby for when it is needed most it s nearly foolproof nearly it s not clear what possessed him to do it but on one tuesday shortly before noon seeber connected a radio transceiver to his laptop and prepared to scan the airwave for the siren system s signal a it blared he searched the spectrum broadly scanning for any activity that matched the siren s call eventually he hit pay dirt ati s proprietary digital radio protocol unfortunately did not benefit from any security measure that would be useful in defending against malicious triggering he found i wa expecting some type of encryption might ve been applied that would have yielded packet with random looking data seeber told gizmodo that wasn t the case these particular activation packet a they call them have the same structure every week he said so it became quickly very apparent that you could forge these packet it s not a simple a a replay attack he said meaning you can t just record the sound and re emit it there s a little more complexity to them but not much more what would it take then to actually trigger the siren someone with an electrical engineering degree would be ideal the most complex bit of course is finding someone to code the software needed to demodulate replicate and transmit the necessary rf signal san francisco s siren are activated by a manned central controller strategically placed within the city when an emergency call the controller transmits digital activation packet to a repeater which according to seebe is located in twin peak the city s second highest summit and geographical center the repeater having receiving the packet in turn transmits the packet over a licensed frequency to the siren each of which contains a modem for demodulating the packet anyone who may intercept them purposefully or by accident will likely only hear what sound like seemingly random tone firing in short burst a binary code unchanging week to week and the key to the siren s annoying song a person who understands this technology a seeber doe should be able to decipher the flow of one and zero and if they re an asshole wake up the entire city oh and they need that   radio too these signal can be scrambled randomized or in other word encrypted to stave off this type of malicious attack but according to bastille a firm that specializes in analyzing rf based attack for bank tech company a well a the government many company believe that merely developing their own radio protocol is security enough having confidence that you re secure simply because no one know what the hell you re doing is sometime called security through obscurity picture a safe with a locking mechanism that no one ha ever seen doe that make it unbreakable a seeber deftly demonstrated the obscurity trick doesn t always work so well what we find in our work in general is that in iot and critical infrastructure and industrial control system a lot of company decide that they re going to implement a proprietary rf protocol a radio frequency protocol to communicate and they may or may not add security to that bastille s chief revenue officer ivan o sullivan told gizmodo seeber s research which wa conducted passively meaning he never actually attempted to trigger the alarm himself demonstrated that ati had not attempted to encrypt it activation sequence likely because it assumed anyone who happened to find it would have no idea what it wa for i do see now various form of new packet that do look more random and that make me optimistic according to it website ati ha a host of featured client one might recognize among them one world trade center and west point academy but it s unclear which system at which location are similarly affected by the vulnerability bastille wa however able to test seeber s discovery at one other location the problem it seems is not san francisco s alone seeber went to the midwest and proved it at a second location o sullivan said we know of at least two confirmed location and that s what we ve done so far but we haven t been able to travel to each of the location the second location seeber informed gizmodo wa in sedgwick county kansa authority there he said confirmed to bastille that they d been working with ati to fix their problem a well what we want now is to make sure that ati s other customer are made aware of the vulnerability communicate with ati and work with them to take and if necessary customize the patch and get it out there added o sullivan said in a public statement tuesday ati did not contest with bastille s finding it did however urged it customer not to panic too much bastille network a company that offer visibility into known and unknown mobile wireless and iot device within an enterprise s corporate airspace reported that by monitoring one of our system for month they have largely deduced the command format of our packet ati wrote adding this is likely true it continued however we wish to point out these are technically sophisticated people who have devoted significant time and effort to this task before customer panic too much please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do spoofing our current protocol is still several order of magnitude harder than spoofing a dtmf based siren system dtmf tone such a those used on old landline telephone have been used in the past to activate emergency system ati confirmed that indeed it wa issuing a patch to further safeguard it system at least one not already protected from the vulnerability which seeber ha named siren jack the siren deployed by ati on military base for instance already use encrypted signal the military s equipment is considerably more expensive however and not every local government will be able to justify the expense ati said thanks to bastille a patch created by ati against siren jack is now currently being tested and the company plan to roll it out soon unfortunately it s not a easy a it sound the siren ati said are not mass market consumer item connected to the internet where you simply download a patch san francisco at least may be able to rest easy change have been apparent say seeber who continues to monitor ati s protocol from his home with his laptop and amazon bought radio i do see now various form of new packet that do look more random he say and that make me optimistic,,,0,0,1,authority warn of high

59,from late  through early  a megaflood of historic proportion put large part of the state of california underwater the state s central valley which is now one of the most productive agricultural are in the country became a vast inland lake the city of sacramento which sits at the intersection of the american and sacramento river flooded and remained under water for month according to one account one quarter of the state s   cattle drowned in the flooding and one third of the state s property wa destroyed see also parade of storm threatens to prolong california dam crisis the great flood of  to  is becoming more likely to reoccur a the climate warms a new study find a study published monday in nature climate change found that despite an overall small change in the state s average yearly precipitation throughout the th century and in projection for the future there may be huge and highly consequential change in precipitation extreme within season some of which have already begun to buffet the state in practical term this mean that what is today considered to be the  year flood an event that would overwhelm the vast majority of california s flood defense and water infrastructure will become the   year flood in the coming decade lead author daniel swain a climate researcher at the university of california at los angeles wrote in a blog post on monday relative change in percent in extremely wet season top extremely dry season middle and year to year whiplash bottom by   in southern california image swain et al  in an interview swain said he wa surprised how sharply the risk of another great flood event increased just over the next  year according to the numerous computer model simulation used in the study the study found that between  and  california s major urban area including san francisco and los angeles are more likely than not to experience at least one extremely severe storm sequence that is similar in magnitude to the great flood this is a three fold increase in the risk of such a devastating event swain said this result is pretty eyebrow raising certainly to me it and may raise some eyebrow in the emergency planning community a well that flood wa the result of an unrelenting series of storm that channeled a firehose of moisture off the pacific ocean known a atmospheric river weather system the study make for sobering reading because it show how sharply the risk of both extremely wet and dry season is increasing along with what the author term precipitation whiplash a the climate oscillates between these two extreme previous study swain said had focused on how annual average precipitation may change a the climate warms but the relatively small amount of change at this timescale is effectively masking far more consequential trend at shorter timescales that seems to be masking very significant change in the character of precipitation and precipitation extreme swain said the researcher utilized computer model to simulate precipitation trend in california during the remainder of the st century studying result from simulation including the business a usual course of greenhouse gas emission a well a control run that did not include an increase in global warming pollutant increasing frequency of precipitation extreme in california image ucla daniel swain one of the more unique insight the study provides is the likelihood that there will be more frequent and drastic year to year precipitation shift much like the one that occurred between a record drought that lasted from about  to  and wa followed by a record wet winter in part of california during the winter of  to  the wet winter peaked with the failure of a spillway at the oroville dam in  which forced about   people to evacuate the study project a  to  percent increase in such precipitation whiplash event during the coming year a the study note california s water infrastructure is simply not prepared for such an escalation in extreme event the study state few of the dam levee and canal that currently protect million living in california s flood plain and facilitate the movement of water from sierra nevada watershed to coastal city have been tested by a deluge a severe a the extraordinary   storm sequence a repeat of which would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damage approaching a trillion dollar the study is consistent with other finding on how precipitation extreme are already changing a the climate warms but it may actually underestimate the severity of these change for california said kevin trenberth a senior researcher at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado trenberth wa not involved in the new study in general a warmer world will provide storm with more moisture to work with a the air s capacity to hold water vapor and the evaporation rate from the land and sea all increase there s already observational evidence showing this is taking place but this new study

face much tougher question than he did in front of the u congress not only are european generally more protective of privacy and more open to breaking up monopoly but the eu is implementing it long

down but in this case troll and ideological ally of the gunman immediately began pounding youtubes server with fresh uploads of the graphic footage every time a tragedy like this happens we learn something new and in this case it wa the unprecedented volume of video neal mohan youtubes chief product officer told the washington post stating the obvious mohan said they would have liked to get a handle on this earlier mohan also told the washington post that the christchurch attack wa a tragedy that wa almost designed for the purpose of going viral adding that youtube ha made progress but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of work ahead of u and this incident ha shown that especially in the case of more viral video like this one there more work to be done the video uploaded over the weekend wasnt unique in it footage of a mass shooting but in it point of view the gunman livestreamed the video from a body cam and mohan reportedly said that the video wa shared a swiftly a one upload per second in the immediate aftermath of the shooting youtube hasnt released exact figure on how many uploads there were of the attack but the number that have been made available on other social platform are staggeringfacebook said that it took down   million video of the attack within the first  hour after the shooting mohan is correct in his assertion that youtube is the model platform for such gruesome virality youtube is the most powerful video sharing platform in the world it also ha a very credible reputation for suggesting video centered around conspiracy theory and white supremacy for nazi what better way to spread their ideology and incite hateful violence than to tap into this easily exploited and herculean platform youtube doe have certain system in place to flag and remove hateful and violent content it can use a hashing system to identify video that match the original video automatically detecting and deleting any copy that are subsequently uploaded unfortunately this system isnt effective when it come to all type of subtle manipulation to the video a the washington post noted user that uploaded video of the christchurch shooting made some tweak to the original video including watermark logo size alteration and animation many violent extremist group like isi use common footage and imagery youtube wrote in a twitter thread on monday these can also be signal for our detection system that help u to remove content at scale the company added however every breaking news event is unique and there are no reference file provided in advance and there also a constant flow of new footage and countless variation of known footage uploaded in the hour immediately after an event these factor present a significant challenge but we are continually working to improve our detection system when we reached out to youtube with some clarifying question about how it filtering system work a spokesperson simply redirected u to this twitter thread that give the broad outline of it functionality youtube here is partly referencing it content id system which let copyright owner preemptively submit file to the platform which will then be cross referenced with any video uploaded to the service these creator can then keep track of when a video is uploaded that match their content while this applies to more innocuous material like music and film it pose the question of whether this same system can apply to video like the christchurch shooting but the footage of the mass shooting flooding the social network over the weekend is unlike existing medium in youtubes database and so it system is unable to preemptively flag it and a previously mentioned wa uploaded with different variation gaming it and evading the system in place this combined with the staggering volume of uploads created a kind of virality that is unprecedented like any piece of machine learning software our matching technology continues to get better but frankly it a work in progress mohan told the washington post because the system in it current state is unable to detect certain variation and because even thousand of human are not enough to urgently eyeball and review flagged video mohan chose to allow the final decision to be made by the machine a weve seen with other failure for ai driven moderation benign video are often accidentally removed that wa likely the case here but ultimately the team chose expediency over precision creator whose content wa unfairly removed can file an appeal the issue plaguing youtube is that troll and extremist have the incentive to hone their effort on it platformtheir content will almost certainly get the most view and subsequently the most share and youtube is infamous for recommending hate related content meaning it is exacerbating the very problem it is trying to eradicate the content is coming from inside the house in the wake of a tragedy caught on film if extremist push that content hard onto the one leading platform while also slightly manipulating some of the version it inevitable that some are going to slip through the system crack and find their way into recommendation a youtube mentioned in it twitter thread on monday it is always working on way to better detect violating content and a we previously mentioned our only saving grace is that those building the platform can remain at least one step ahead of those trying to abuse them it an unsettling reality and one that may have social network reckoning with their role a catalyst for this new disturbing virality the washington

83,enlarge riverfront ave in calgary during the alberta flood  reader comment  in june  keith musselman wa living in the canadian rockies when the nearby bow river flooded we were in a valley so we were stuck for about five day musselman told ar the community wa devastated the flood wa one of the costliest and most devastating natural disaster in canada s history with five people killed more than   evacuated and extreme property damage heavy rainfall falling on late snow in the mountain had overwhelmed river and reservoir and musselman a hydrologist realized that this kind of rain on snow flooding wasn t properly understood forecaster have a good handle on what happens when rain fall he say but when that rain fall in mountain where there s deep snow we don t have a good handle on what the flood volume will be musselman and a group of colleague used historical data to sketch out what the rain on snow flood risk look like across western north america and how that risk is likely to change in a warming world their paper published in nature climate change this week find that some area will see reduced risk thanks to declining snowfall but at higher elevation there ll still be snow and the increasing amount of rain falling on that snow will have implication for flood risk the perfect storm at drier and higher elevation rainfall on snow isn t so much of a problem either because there s not enough rain or not enough snow for it to matter but when the condition are just right heavy rainfall can combine with snowmelt to produce flood that are more catastrophic than the rainfall would cause when musselman moved to work at the national center for atmospheric research ncar his colleague there had also identified this a something they wanted to study and they had a great dataset musselman say we used that to understand how rare these large flood event are work ha been done on this before but this team wa able to use more fine grained data to build up a detailed picture they built a simulated world of weather system that would produce rain on snow flood in the same place and with the same frequency a the  year of historical data they used once they were sure that the simulation matched the historical pattern of snowpack snowmelt and other factor they used it to build up a picture of how those kind of event might change over the next  year the model showed shifting pattern area that currently have a high risk of flooding will see a decrease a precipitation will occur more frequently a rain than snow but at higher elevation where once there would have been snow falling on a snowpack rising temperature will now cause rain to fall on that snow the sierra nevada canadian rockies and colorado river headwater saw the highest increase in risk with flood twice a likely in some case philip mote who study climate related snowpack change and wasn t involved in this work point out that the starting rate of flood might not be particularly high so a doubling of the risk might not necessarily mean a region suddenly awash with flood the shifting landscape will nonetheless demand a rethink of flood management but for that more data will be needed computational limit climate scientist like to look at period of  year musselman note but his team had to limit the time window because they were running into the limit of computational power available to them we re up against this wall of computational demand to simulate all the physic that are involved he explains the two  year simulation took up a year of ncar supercomputer time so they were also only able to look at one climate change scenario the average of all  different climate model in a business a usual emission scenario ideally it would also be good to know what the projection look like under additional climate scenario the  year simulation is ok if it s treated carefully say prof mote that s a constraint if you re running a km resolution over the whole of the u that s a whole heck of a lot of computing and data it doe make thing tricky for region that have rare event that might be represented only a few time across  year he explains the exact way those event change is probably le robust than if they had a  or  year simulation opening the floodgate in anticipation of winter and spring rainfall reservoir manager in many region release large amount of water in the fall creating space to buffer the incoming deluge reservoir manager follow tight rule musselman explains they have guideline based on historical data the challenge is a the climate change our rule and regulation aren t adjusting accordingly the simulation suggests that the flood risk isn t the only thing set to change seasonal timing will change too in some region the highest risk is likely to shift from spring to winter in others from winter to spring this mean new rule both for providing flood buffer and for ensuring enough refill during dry period the current rule are heavily focused on date say charles luce a hydrologist who study water management changing the rule is complicated because of all the different people involved but there s already work underway to figure out how to update the rule in the face of climate change he say that work will likely be looking to this paper for guidance the flood protection infrastructure itself also need a look say civil engineer farshid vahedifard levee and dam need to be re analyzed to see if they can safely withstand and handle this new pattern of flooding this is particularly crucial he add since most of these dam and levee are old and a good percentage of them are currently operating under marginal condition there s still work to be done to turn this risk projection into useful information though it s the first step in a series of study that aim to better understand the hydrology say musselman future work will need to look at how this translates to a very local scale including how factor like soil saturation and vegetation affect the risk of runoff becoming a flood and ongoing observation of the real situation on the ground will also be essential hydrologist wouter berghuijs agrees with mote that the simulation match what intuition would predict but it s good to see it confirmed in harder number say berghuijs these model are not perfect and there are uncertainty associated with them he add that doe not mean they don t provide useful insight nature climate change  doi   s    about doi,,,1,1,1,trump administration declares major disaster  for shasta county due to carr fire

106,california continues to take stock of it unprecedented conflagration between the camp fire in the north which on it own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in california history and the woolsey fire in the south  life have been lost so far with hundred more still missing a firefighter keep battling the blaze a new menace is emerging debris flow the rain are coming to california a soon a tuesday night and the fire have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more life the coastal town of montecito in southern california learned this lesson le than a year ago last december the massive thomas fire burned through the hill right up to the edge of town thanks to the community comprehensive fire preparedness plan only  home were lost but a month later the scorched hill outside of town let loose a storm driven debris flow that enveloped the town killing  the problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself when a wildfire burn vegetation it release organic compound these compound are heated in the fire volatilize and then re condense on soil particle say brian ebel a hydrologist with the usgs this soil normally absorbs water but the organic compound turn it hydrophobic literally meaning fear of water it is not an understatement you can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off a if the dirt were polished marble the water will pool up and sit there and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire scorched soil say ebel problem number two vegetation anchor the soil when fire burn it away the soil loosens you can think of vegetation a a protective blanket say jason kean a hydrologist at the usgs without it sediment ha nothing to hold it in place before there s even rain debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channel now hydrologist and meteorologist are keeping a close eye on community that butt up against these latest fire where the condition are set for catastrophic debris flow when the rain come once it start raining hard on a burn area the thing can get generated really fast like five minute say kean the debris flow can carry boulder and tree along with mud making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide when you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go  kilometer say kean the video below show just how easily the flow toss boulder around boulder can also act like a moving dam retarding the flow so you get this surging behavior where these thing are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it add kean it really make the flow depth increase several time what you d get in a water only flood the montecito debris flow got to be  foot deep at point lodging boulder in tree human are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow but it can be predicted giving resident a chance to evacuate the work begin a soon a a wildfire smoke clear enough for satellite to get a good look at how badly area have burned this information is relayed to scientist on the ground who enter those burned region a soon a it safe the greatest risk of debris flow is in the zone that burned the most intensely and scientist spend two or three day wandering the fire perimeter taking soil sample that involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil the water repellency say eric huff staff chief of cal fire forest practice program and actually getting down on hand and knee and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing whether or not organic matter ha been completely burned off kean and his colleague then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flow have let loose in the area historically building a map that capture the probability and potential volume of a debris flow they also identify value at riskhuman life and structure that may be in danger with all this data in mind they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different region of the map often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off or a little a five minute of heavy rain it s kind of a run of the mill storm say kean it s heavy rain but it s not particularly exceptional so the national weather service carefully watch storm a they head into california unfortunately with climate change california may see fewer yet more intense storm going forward a the rain approach the coast official can send out wireless alert like you would get for an amber alert a well a warning on tv and radio which brings u back to the montecito disaster forecaster saw the storm coming predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour what we saw in reality that night wa a  minute heavy rain that moved through that area say eric boldt a warning coordination meteorologist at the national weather service it wa closer to six and a half inch per hour and there s no computer model that exist today that can predict that type of rate official had put voluntary evacuation order in place but not everyone heeded the advice this wa just after the thomas fire after all they had just been evacuated for two or three week over the holiday season say boldt they were just getting comfortable back in their home and they didn t want to leave again if you havent cleared out in time and the flow come the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house for instance out on the street is exactly where you don t want to be a the flow follows those path we ve even seen people if they were able to get up on their countertop in their kitchen the mud came up to about that level say boldt it s a different way of thinking about the impact because it s not the same a a flash flood with a flash flood you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground flee up a hill just before a debris flow though and that ground could kill you the debris flow risk can persist for up to five year after a wildfire so resident whose home narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hill for longer than a year but the danger is most certainly there it a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the camp and woolsey fire but it also an extremely important one a menace begets another menace more great wired story,,,1,1,1,rare tornado touch down in seattle suburb

cnn about  million american live in area that have a chance of flooding and the number exposed to serious flooding is a much a   time higher than previous estimate time is clearly not on our side sea level are rising faster than predicted and homeowner in particularly vulnerable area such a south florida could see their property literally under water within their lifetime relative sea level there are roughly four inch higher now than in  various projection including by the army corp of engineer see rise in south florida of  inch by  and between  to  foot by  what s more rare event are going to become more common in the future strictly due to sea level rise william sweet an oceanographer at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa told the guardian and so it would make some sense that a official tally the damage from hurricane florence in the carolina with  dead and insured loss estimated at   billion coastal homeowner and business might conduct their own tally of the cost of continuing to live in place vulnerable to flooding and high wind yet national and local leader appear to be sleepwalking toward climate catastrophe based on my own exchange over the year with municipal mayor from both inland and coastal jurisdiction my sense is that few view it a a top priority especially those in place such a south florida where the property tax base is the main source of income rather than curbing building in vulnerable area or returning flood prone area to nature jurisdiction such a miami beach have opted to spend million on flood abatement project and for their part financial market deflect reality climate change is a very slow moving disaster that may last decade before it ha any effect on the market wall street investor michael popow told me in the meantime it is another negative in the macro economic environment which will sooner than later cause the market to crash but this disaster is not so slow moving monster storm are coming faster and with more ferocity last year wa the f irst time in over a decade t hat four hurricane made u landfall in one season and a growing number of coastal dweller have now lived through multiple storm with some not even fully recovered from the last one by one estimate from seattle based zillow research based on current projection by noaa of ocean level rising six foot by  almost  million property or roughly  of u housing stock worth   billion could be under water in a little over  year close to half of that loss in value would occur in florida alone where  in  property worth a total of   billion are threatened a zillow point out given the insatiable appetite for waterfront property these number could be on the conservative side if development is allowed to continue in vulnerable area in fact sea level rise is already swamping coastal property value research b y the first street foundation ha tabulated a home value loss of    billion across eight coastal u state since  ironic is it not that some of the most coveted and expensive property in the u is also becoming the most vulnerable and is on a depreciation cycle in my frequent trip to south florida i encounter more and more people who are contemplating moving away from the waterfront especially in flood prone miami beach where even on clear day during high tide and even with billion spent on flood alleviation measure resident can encounter so called blue sky flooding according to one study such high tide flooding there ha increased by more than  in the last  year in short if you re a young to middle aged homeowner near water in south florida there is a chance that your property will be under water by the time you are a senior or more likely when the time come to sign the title over to little jane or johnny john hilliard s approach towards rising sea level is probably typical of many of those who reside on the venetian island the elevation of his new waterfront home in miami beach is at about nine foot above sea level that s reasonably high he told me i do see larger rain event due to the greater water holding ability of a warmer atmosphere but that rain should run off my island into the sea instead of flooding and staying after  we will be wishing we took this issue seriously a the loss of property will be enormous what will be the trigger to cause mass panic or a collapse of the waterfront property bubble the former mayor of coral gable james cason offer a stark scenario when water level in that tony community rise to the point where the mast of sailboat are unable to pas under it main bridge that is when people will suddenly see their property value go down because they can no longer get a boat out so that will be one of the first indicator of sea level rise and a wake up call for people of course outward migration from place like coral gable will translate into a slimmer property tax ledger for the seaside town which in turn creates challenge for such municipality to provide essential service and municipal bond already in a precarious state could sink even further when they are issued by jurisdiction known to have massive flooding problem while it would take a lot for city like miami beach to be abandoned rising tide and more frequent monster storm are becoming like the ravaging forest fire in california a new normal one study predicts there will be a many a  million climate refugee in america by the end of the century with the hardest hit county being miami dade even with inaction by a white house that prefers to ignore or deny climate change withdrawing from the paris climate agreement and activating rollback on the clean power plan there are localized measure that could defer a crash of the u coastal property bubble due to rising sea level mayor need to step up to the plate and use the tool and policy at their disposal one which ha already been implemented in many developing country in the wake of the  indian ocean tsunami is to return vulnerable area to nature that happened in the u in flood prone mastic beach new york after superstorm sandy where damaged home were bought back and the land transformed into wetland sea wall and strict building code can force

left leaning thinker would have preferred but in his word at least he took care to show respect and consideration for the view of his colleague across the aisle those quality in particular became an increasingly refreshing presence in a post  political atmosphere that s largely been defined by partisan bickering and below the belt scheming mccain served with honor even at a time when fewer and fewer of his colleague can say the same prior to entering politics a career that included more than  year in the u s house of representative and senate a well a a competitive presidential campaign in  against barack obama mccain wa a military man he joined the u s navy in the late  and became a pilot over the year mccain earned a reputation for breaking rank from fellow republican mccain didn t see his first combat assignment until  when the vietnam war wa in full swing le than a year into his service during his rd bombing run mccain s plane wa shot down and he wa captured by north vietnamese force he then spent the next five and a half year a a prisoner of war until his release in  he continued to serve in the year after his release eventually taking on the role of the u s navy s liaison to the senate mccain retired in  a a highly decorated captain during his time in the navy he earned two silver star two legion of merit the distinguished flying cross three bronze star medal two purple heart two navy and marine corp commendation medal and a prisoner of war medal this handful of paragraph doesn t fully capture mccain s long and illustrious career it should however give you the

reservoir and the peril of developing the katy prairie he remembers escaping year ago to the prairie to bird watch one recent morning he drove me out there along the grand parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision a saleswoman in a model home boasted about  billion worth of box store and mall being built nearby the development she said adheres to county standard requiring that house be raised above the  year floodplain the woman handed mr blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer which he scanned before climbing back into the car shaking his head the disclaimer explained that road outside the development linking it to the parkway occupy the  year floodplain meaning they would have about a  percent chance of flooding every year these day that mean they ll flood anytime you look at them funny mr blackburn said it s the new normal that s not far off the number of heavy precipitation event in the united state ha skyrocketed since the s since  instance of extreme weather hurricane flood heat wave linked to climate change have cost the united state   trillion study show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness american taxpayer could save  in emergency relief and reconstruction not counting health cost the impact of lost job and business revenue and incalculable grief but that requires politician to agree we suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster a veteran texas lobbyist bill miller said it happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don t believe in tax and government but they also don t want anybody discouraged from coming here because that s bad for business an upbeat narrative cast business friendly texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy disdainful of coastal elite don t california my texas ha become a rallying cry for republican state lawmaker and a theme repeated by the governor greg abbott who ha complained about a patchwork quilt of ban and rule and regulation that is eroding the texas model he belief city are the culprit for year texas republican promoted local control to push against federal court order on issue like desegregation and same sex marriage now state leader have made a u turn mr abbott ha complained about political demagogue using climate change a an excuse to remake the american economy at a republican gathering in june he talked about the experience of driving out of the state s capital austin it start smelling different he told the audience and you know what that fragrance is freedom little wonder post harvey that state and local official have anointed different flood and recovery czar texas is sounding these day like russia under the romanov the system ensures nobody is clearly in charge least of all in houston a bill that would have allowed harris county merely to issue the equivalent of parking ticket to developer violating floodplain regulation the sort of regulation that control flooding wa vetoed by the governor two other bill to study flooding in the houston region introduced in the last legislative session died in committee and not long ago when houston s democratic mayor sylvester turner petitioned the governor to tap into the state s multibillion dollar rainy day fund for post harvey debris removal mr abbott said he would not authorize money before  when the legislature is next scheduled to meet i met with the mayor in city hall at the time he noted that the legislature had convened a special session to ban gender neutral bathroom if they can meet about toilet why can t they meet when the toilet overflow one frustrated city official said before mr abbott came up with   million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism another official this one with the county made the point that the area around houston is a patchwork of county and municipality with different rule and no coordination because texan believed the upside of what became in essence institutionalized entropy wa that it allowed resident to avoid the encumbrance of city government regulation and tax the problem is that hurricane and flood worsened by climate change do not recognize political border or county line their toll is shared by everyone the latest estimate from moody s put recovery from harvey at   billion much of which will end up paid by taxpayer across the united state the whole trans mississippi pioneer

and highway and ha precious little mass transit but the municipality of houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in america houston ha more green space relative to paved than new york and what many houston resident like about it it supporter say is precisely that it isn t new york or san francisco or boston they insist that it business friendly light on regulation approach help account for a big rise in employment since  a report by the city s center for opportunity urbanism a pro development organization which caution against overreacting to harvey said the city emanates a conviction that people should have the freedom to determine their destiny photo houston s sprawl and it dependence on the automobile contributed to the misery that hurricane harvey

california a our planet warms up the climate related change across the u s are well underway even if you havent had to cope with climate related problem yet it may not be long before you have to protect your home from extreme weather fire flooding or even sea level rise to find out how climate change may affect your area check out climate risk by region using the u s climate resilience toolkit a short video introduces the different part of the website you might want to go to the step to resilience section that offer way to ass and reduce your risk for example your flood risk depends not just on your own home and where it sits but also on thing like how the city ha channeled nearby creek and what size culvert your local department of public work ha installed beneath your street or road when it rain harder than ever before undersized culvert may be overwhelmed and creek can back up and jump their bank flooding home and road in santa cruz california the city climate action manager tiffany wise west phd ha posted a detailed action plan including a practical adaptation action for resident were not covering every little thing she say but the city simple web page is a place for ordinary people to start santa cruz county is one of the rare place that already ha a detailed plan for the future ask your city and county government if they have a local hazard mitigation plan like this one but even if your area doesnt you can rough out a way to address the specific risk your home could face in general climate change expert talk about two way of addressing climate change

level by nearly four meter  foot wise west say the santa cruz plan is about the same whether the sea rise a meter in  year or sooner it just a matter of moving up the schedule she say looking serious if you look at port arthur texas on the surging sea website and set sea level to one meter  foot you can glimpse the future here is port arthur today port arthur is home to   people and the largest oil refinery in the united state here what it could look like with one meter of sea level rise that mean that if you lived in port arthur youd have to think about not only how sea level rise would affect your own backyard but also how it would affect the oil refinery and how that would affect you thats a lesson to cast your net wide when thinking about how climate change might affect you through indirect effect go to your own address on the surging sea website and see what one meter of sea level rise look like maybe your home is fine but the nearest fire station the grocery store and

155,new research connects a powerful volcanic eruption and a medieval poem that conjured memory of the dreaded event to iceland s conversion to christianity at the turn of the th century iceland s settler formally replaced odin thor and freya with jesus mary and joseph a new paper published in climatic change suggests memory of the eldgj lava flood the largest volcanic eruption to hit iceland in the past   year convinced icelander to turn away from their norse god and embrace christianity this conclusion reached by scientist from the university of cambridge wa made possible by establishing a firm date for the eruption and a reinterpretation of a grim poem called vlusp meaning the prophecy of the seeress prior to the new study scientist knew about the terrible eldgj lava flood but they couldn t figure out when it actually happened estimate placed the eruption anywhere from  through to  with a best guess at  based on scattered evidence to finally get it right a research team led by clive oppenheimer collected data from ice core and tree ring showing that the eruption started in the spring of  and continued until autumn  indeed the eldgj lava flood a it name and duration suggests wasn t any ordinary eruption it happened in the southern region of iceland along a  km long  mile fissure linked to the katla volcano the eruption threw massive amount of lava onto the land while spewing sulphurous gas into the atmosphere an estimated  cubic kilometer of magma poured from the crack needle to say the eruption had an impact on iceland s inhabitant who began to settle the island around  this place the eruption squarely within the experience of the first two or three generation of iceland s settler said oppenheimer in a statement some of the first wave of migrant to iceland brought over a child may well have witnessed the eruption the settler likely abandoned much of the island or relocated elsewhere a famine wa probably severe but no text survived to tell u exactly what happened but that s where the poem could help the researcher claim a certain reading of vlusp dated to around  seems to paint an apocalyptic scene of the condition both during and after the eruption and even the onset of a cold volcanic winter which wa felt around the globe the wolf is filled with the life blood of doomed men reddens the power dwelling with ruddy gore the sun beam turn black the following summer weather all woeful do you know yet or what the sun start to turn black land sink into sea the bright star scatter from the sky steam spurt up with what nourishes life flame fly high against heaven itself the poem also predicts the end of iceland s norse god and the rise of a new singular deity could this be construed a the conversion of iceland to christianity the researcher think it s a distinct possibility with a firm date for the eruption many entry in medieval chronicle snap into place a likely consequence sighting in europe of an extraordinary atmospheric haze severe winter and cold summer poor harvest and food shortage said oppenheimer but most striking is the almost eyewitness style in which the eruption is depicted in volusp the poem s interpretation a a prophecy of the end of the pagan god and their replacement by the one singular god suggests that memory of this terrible volcanic eruption were purposefully provoked to stimulate the christianisation of iceland that account of a severe volcanic eruption one still seared in memory were used to fuel theological debate and proselytize icelander in the th century is not a outlandish a it may appear the argument may have sounded quite compelling and the new religion may have offered some solace and reassurance oppenheimer and his colleague present a good case but like anything there s likely more to it than a scary poem the reason for iceland s conversion to christianity are complex and multifaceted the story of a horrible volcano quite possibly being among the many reason why the norse god were abandoned climatic change,,,0,1,1,disastrous  atlantic hurricane season end  with hard hit area still reeling

exxon and tar sand producer suncor energy it represents a new front in the legal war that s pitting community stuck paying for the cost of climate change against the company that caused it and it could spread to neighboring state in flyover country yes sea level rise will be important elise jones a commissioner in boulder county who is part of the new suit told earther middle america is being hit by climate change too we thought it wa important that we tell that story the story is one of both big present impact visible in the wildfire scarred hill and flood scoured waterway and small one tucked away in the excel spreadsheet about the cost of road paving culvert and air conditioner for school in our eye it s a pretty simple issue of property right david bookbinder a lawyer with the libertarian niskanen center who is consulting on the case told earther we have local community faced with tremendously escalating cost of dealing with climate change it s not some future hypothetical it s been happening for year it s happening for today and quite literally local taxpayer are getting stuck with the bill boulder county for instance is still recovering from a   year rainfall event in  that sent murky torrent of water streaming down canyon tearing out road and bridge and inundating the city of boulder middle america is being hit by climate change too the county blew through it   million in reserve cash shortly after the disaster to make up for the shortfall it asked resident to approve a five year sale tax hike it also relied on federal fund and public tax money to help with cleanup and recovery and jones told earther recovery still isn t over i wa a brand new commissioner when the flood hit and i remember somebody saying it wa going to take at least five year to rebuild and i thought they were crazy she said but it s going to take a full decade to recover from that one incident research ha shown climate change increased the intensity of the rainfall event by about  percent the rise in extreme precipitation event portends an even more challenging and potentially costlier future good news oil company are woke to the reality of climate change there s just one small hitch read more read a county commissioned report show that even without climate shock like the  flood or a  wildfire that wa colorado s most destructive at the time the cost of adaptation will be steep peering into those excel sheet and then overlaying the climate impact of more heat wildfire and increased risk of drought between the deluge revealed the county could be stuck with a bill of up to   million in adaptation cost if we do nothing to curb carbon emission boulder is a comparatively wealthy county with a solid tax base of   but jones said the burden of adaptation is too much to handle which is why they re suing oil company we can t afford it and it s not fair she said if that s true for boulder county then it s even more so for san miguel county which is also part of the suit the county is located in southwest colorado and home to spectacular peak straight off the coors label seriously a well a sprawling farm land it tax base is smaller than boulder s but a with so many county in the west the infrastructure need are the same san miguel county ha a population of le than   bookbinder said they have a many road a boulder county and they re  th of the size they re in a box they have to spend money and there s no one handing out hundred of million for upkeep the lawsuit against exxon and suncor is one way to find fund oil company have known for decade about the impact of climate change all while spending million to sow doubt publicly exxon s knowledge wa exposed in groundbreaking reporting from by insideclimate news in  and since then other domino have fallen those report have opened oil company to a growing host of lawsuit by local government seeking damage and criminal investigation by attorney general in massachusetts new york and elsewhere suncor wa named in the colorado lawsuit because it worked in the state and produce the dirtiest oil on the planet in the form of albertan tar sand the idea that the fossil fuel industry would say yep our product are causing this we re going make more of them including product that are more carbon intensive seems absurd bookbinder said talk about giving the finger to local government it will likely take year for all these suit to wend their way through federal and state court whether they result in payouts or settlement is still very much unknown but amy markwell a lawyer for san miguel county told earther the defendant argument aren t that hard to follow climate change can be a fairly complicated issue but this lawsuit we re trying to keep it pretty simple she said your neighbor doe something that damage you or your property you can go to your local courthouse and seek local damage payment this is in essence the same argument that coastal community are making the new colorado case show the damage landlocked county face will be different but no le severe and that big oil can expect more legal challenger from all corner to come looking for a just settlement,,,1,1,1,u

caption harvey s persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in part of texas it ha certainly been a bad year but over time are hurricane getting worse there have been  of the strongest category  hurricane since  eleven of these have occurred in the past  year we know that hurricane are powered by warm sea and over the past  year global average sea temperature have risen by about c but when you look at the total strength of storm in each year since record began some year are more fearsome than others meteorologist use something called accumulated cyclone energy ace to calculate the total wind power of all the storm in any given year a you can see from the following chart there s no clear upward trend why not even though sea are getting warmer other factor can prevent hurricane forming in particular year saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation a can the close proximity of african storm to the equator but one of the great weather irony is that hurricane hate strong wind strong wind in the atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm this stop the storm growing into a hurricane during a phenomenon called el nio the pacific ocean near the equator get warmer than usual this affect global wind pattern leading to stronger wind in the atlantic that mean el nio year tend to be quiet year for hurricane but when the pacific is cooler known a la nia the reverse is true making it easier for hurricane to form and  is a la nia year in fact the total storm strength in la nia year ha been rising decade by decade land drainage high wind are just part of the story climate change affect hurricane season in other way too rainfall during hurricane can be devastating hurricane harvey would have brought severe flooding to houston regardless of climate change but it is reasonable to assume that harvey brought more rain than it would have done  year ago global air temperature have also increased by about c in the past  year and warmer air hold more water that s likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall event seen in the u in recent decade image copyright epa image caption extreme rainfall event are becoming more common in the u according to data from the epa but the location of housing compounded the damage houston s population ha more than doubled since  to more than two million people housing development are expanding into more marginal poorly drained land this put more people in harm s way climate change is also causing sea to rise melting glacier and land based ice sheet contribute to higher sea level image copyright getty image image caption melting glacier are causing sea level to rise also warmer water occupies a larger volume so a sea warm up sea level rise in the u the largest sea level rise is around the coast of the gulf of mexico about  mm each year at eugene island louisiana all of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricane and their associated storm surge reach land a warmer world is bringing u a greater number of hurricane and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category  there s an increased risk of flood damage whether related to

203,enlarge this nilometer at cairo is an ancient device that egyptian used to measure nile flooding to predict the harvest and set tax level scientist used historical data from nileometers to see how volcanic eruption affected nile flood and by extension the health of the harvest reader comment  from   bce ancient egypt wa ruled by the ptolemaic dynasty a greek family put in place after alexander the great conquered egypt though egypt s wealth and importance were legendary during this time it wa also a period of great civil unrest perhaps because they were being ruled by foreigner the egyptian people revolted against their leadership several time during the s sparking civil war but now scientist believe these revolt may have broken out in part because of a chain reaction started by volcano halfway across the world there s no doubt that the egyptian were chafing under the yoke of their foreign monarch the day of the great pharaoh were over and leader from the north were replacing egyptian culture with greek god and architecture but why did the egyptian resentment boil over into open revolt sometimes and remain at a steady simmer otherwise historian francis ludlow of trinity college ireland and his colleague believe that ash dust and other particle released by volcano during the s bce caused temperature to cool around the globe cooling resulted in le water evaporation which meant le rain for northern africa and therefore le flooding of the life giving nile river because the ancient egyptian were a farming culture that lived and died by the harvest the annual nile flood wa key to survival flood meant nutrient rich water fed the field and everyone could eat nile level were so important to the egyptian economy that the government based tax amount on reading from nilometers stone well fed by the river where they could measure it height in cubit if the level were trending too high destructive flooding or too low drought tax were scaled back to account for people s diminished fortune year with low rainfall inevitably meant people wanted for more and had le to lose gripe with the government became full scale rebellion like the  year theban revolt that started in  bce and the egyptian revolt against ptolemy iii between   bce both came after period of increased volcanic activity though many other factor were in play there is an undeniable correlation between eruption and rebellion against the ptolemaic regime the volcanic house of card ludlow and his colleague gathered data for their hypothesis from a range of source they consulted the historical record to figure out when rebellion and unrest took place in egypt in addition they measured social unrest by looking at when the ptolemaic government issued new edict such a the famous rosetta stone erected during the great revolt of   bce affirming the king s power over a restless population the researcher did this under the assumption that the king would only need to issue such edict if he felt his regime wa threatened having established a chronology of uprising the researcher went volcano hunting volcano large enough to affect the climate also leave behind a telltale debris signature of volcanic sulfate in the ice of greenland and antarctica by drilling out core of ice from these area scientist can reconstruct when an eruption took place in the geological record but could they be certain that these eruption affected nile flooding to answer this question the researcher returned again to the historical record observing that eruption in the th century had reduced nile flood another treasure trove of data came from careful record of flood level measured by keeper of the islamic nilometer between   ce by analyzing this data ludlow and his colleague were able to model how much a given eruption would affect the nile s annual flood cycle the researcher found a clear connection between volcanic aerosol level in the atmosphere and weak nile flooding university of hawaii classicist robert littman who wa not involved in the study urged caution when looking at flood level he s studied nilometers extensively and noted that fluctuation in the level of the nile would have varied greatly from region to region we have text that say  cubit is the ideal level in luxor but in the north in the delta it s seven cubit so there s no guarantee that an eruption would have affected all area in egypt the same way littman added that we also can t discount political pressure such a ongoing war in syria a catalyst for revolt ludlow agreed with littman that poor flood season were just one part cause for social unrest he acknowledged the revolt were the result of many condition that happened to coalesce at the right time these include ethnic tension with some resentment bubbling away among the native egyptian populace against the new greek elite ruling egypt after alexander the great s conquest combined with economic policy enacted by the ptolemy such a the decision to move to a great focus on free threshing wheat a opposed to other grain that were le vulnerable to drought because this wa the favorite bread grain in the greek world and could be exported for greater profit but he added the low flood level could be a tipping point we frame the volcanic eruption and the associated failure of the nile summer floodwaters a trigger because their impact occurs suddenly without warning there may be decade without a major volcanic eruption but then one or more suddenly occurs he explained via email another way of putting it is that you could consider ethic tension and economic stress a a chronic contribution or cause while the sudden and short term shock from a volcanic eruption is an acute contribution of cause in other word the already troubled egyptian polity wa teetering on the brink the abrupt reversal of fortune caused by bad flood season pushed them over into armed rebellion climate and future social problem there are interesting exception during the  and  bce egypt suffered greatly from reduced flooding and it attendant peril like mass starvation plague and inflation but queen cleopatra the last of the ptolemy managed to quell revolt she did it ludlow said by offering grain relief from state granary and banning export of grain volcano induced revolt were not inevitable good public policy could make up for environmental disaster ludlow and his colleague say the climate history of the nile offer a lesson to city coping with disaster today yale environmental scientist and study co author jennifer marlon noted that it is very rare in science and history to have such strong and detailed evidence documenting how society responded to climatic shock in the past uc berkeley public policy professor solomon hsiang who wa not involved in the study ha spent most of his career showing correlation between natural disaster and long term socio economic problem over the past several year he s worked with the

thursday thought he wa in his home office he had just poured himself a glass of cabernet he had been looking at the online forecast from the national hurricane center and agreed with their essential conclusion harvey wa a well organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the texas gulf coast somewhere between corpus christi and port o connor berger also backed the center s belief that the wind would be strong in houston that weekend perhaps more than  mile per hour but he wa far more worried about the rain the unanswered question is what happens to harvey once it reach the coast berger wrote where will it go and will it go fast enough houston s rainfall total over the next five day depend on this and we just don t know the considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer model and the model which take different variable temperature moisture mass and consider them in different way are not always in agreement the national hurricane center take input from several model to make it prediction averaging out their difference in part because it face the tallest order in hurricane forecasting it must say that the hurricane will go here so must television meteorologist one of the center s principal conduit to a concerned public tv too demand a singular answer berger doesn t have to draw a line he is a certified meteorologist but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for ar technica a site owned by wired medium group and he blog about the weather in his free time that give him two luxury that most front line meteorologist don t have he can value certain model and their ensemble much more heavily than others untangling a many a  different version of each forecast and he can also admit doubt he can explore the subtlety of the weather marveling at it mystery the way he ha for his small but loyal community of reader for year but especially since he established his site in october  berger doe not generate his forecast from scratch pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking reading from the galileo thermometer on his windowsill he really doe have a galileo thermometer on his windowsill but he work out of a home office that he hasn t otherwise bothered to decorate with a basic pc and a single monitor on which he toggle between tab from forecast to conflicting forecast in houston that evening the u government forecast called for about  inch of rain by then berger had already begun to wonder there is one model he ha come to trust and rely on more than any other the european centre for medium range weather forecast integrated forecasting system more popularly known in the u a the european model funded by  eu member and  cooperating state the european model is sometimes shockingly accurate in part because it s so well financed and it computing power is stronger than most with harvey it suggested that the storm would stall over houston dumping  inch of rain or more before eventually moving on that synced with berger s own analysis of the weather pattern in the atmosphere he detected a troublesome absence of steering current the force that push hurricane to wherever they re headed next and without those current the european model s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense given the sum of the evidence before him berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction and he wrote a much big time flood are coming to texas it wa at it essence an informed gut call and berger thought carefully about what he would write next he had made his reputation such a it wa for a leisure time meteorologist with a city specific weather blog by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzy that competent weather observer dismiss a storm porn he is by nature a fairly skeptical person his twin passion space and the weather share long history of broken promise and unmet expectation his site s motto is hype free forecast for greater houston mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuation prompted by hurricane rita in  i am not going to sugar coat this my friend he had written in advance of that storm a a houston resident and property owner i am truly mortified right now rita and berger had both missed but underplaying weather of dire consequence could lead to a different kind of calamity for his reader james spann alabama s longtime weather forecaster of choice had infamously botched that state s ice storm of january  spann had predicted a dusting of snow and unworried commuter headed out on the road when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousand of people who ended up stranded in their car school and workplace overnight berger despises alarmism in all it form he also didn t want to bear responsibility for child drowning in their attic berger s wife amanda wa getting their own two daughter ready for bed in their league city apartment temporary accommodation while the family build their dream home in nearby clear creek his dog bonnie a maltese poodle cross who dislike all men but him kept her usual vigilant watch berger can be painfully shy now he felt possessed by an unusual authority exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word he took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard certainly the corpus christi area and point immediately north and west of there will get too much rain he wrote flooding will spread to other part of texas too quite possibly houston but right now we can t say that for certain a i ve said it s either going to be pretty bad or really really bad here he posted his piece his site normally averaged somewhere between   and   view a day that particular entry received   over the next  hour a shocked berger surmised that his core reader were recommending him to their suddenly weather concerned friend he had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm in the comment one reader asked what berger thought the rainfall total might be in san antonio  mile to the west someone else asked about colorado county and another about the neighborhood near ellington field another reader wondered whether her husband s flight out of hobby airport on saturday morning might be delayed a man named petey james pointed out that saturday night wa the night of the big fight between floyd mayweather and conor mcgregor and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home a woman named deb walter asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near dacus on saturday afternoon i d press ahead at this point berger wrote to her obviously if thing turn ugly saturday morning you ll have to cancel the following morning friday august  it started to rain a few drop at first and then a fairly steady shower harvey s leading edge had come to town and the model constantly updated began to align harvey wa nearly laser precise in it construction and massive and it wa also a slow mover the rain wa going to be measured in foot not inch berger sat down at his desk no wine this time and wrote another post a very serious flooding situation is coming he wrote he wrote it two more time for emphasis a very serious flooding situation is coming a very serious flooding situation is coming it wa   pm he hoped deb walter had canceled her party million turned to berger s space city weather blog during the storm since  there have been more than  weather and climate event in the united state that have each caused more than  billion in damage three principal national body are charged with predicting their arrival and effect the storm prediction center in norman oklahoma keep watch for tornado the weather prediction center in college park maryland monitor heavy rain and the national hurricane center in miami mind hurricane they have been busy in the case of harvey all three were involved funneling their best information to the houston branch of the national weather service one of it  field office across the country each help turn national forecast into finely tuned local one the houston office is the only one that share space with it home county s office of emergency management galveston county in it case better to coordinate their shared response it is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their office are on the upper floor over the past few decade greater houston ha grown exponentially from a mosquito plagued oil port into the fifth largest metro area in the united state home to nearly  million people that population explosion combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight ha seen former swamp turned into sprawling unregulated development houston ha been built to flood dan reilly  is the local warning coordination meteorologist part of the national weather service s round the clock professional staff in a catastrophe prone city like his the job is twofold the first is the forecast when something bad is coming that s really when we need to be at the top of our game he say of the three most damaging effect of hurricane wind storm surge and rain rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance the heaviest rain typically fall in small pocket and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to  hour ahead of it arrival houston s physical size also make rain forecast challenging each side of the i  for instance one of several highway that serve a boundary in an otherwise endless city might receive a substantially different amount a good meteorologist is almost always by definition skilled at pattern recognition weather like the law is built on a foundation of similar case veteran meteorologist reilly ha been in the job for  year mine their memory for analogue in the early hour of harvey reilly s team began upping the national weather service s rain forecast to amount that no one had ever seen  inch  and eventually  over a widespread swath of houston reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest a killing flood wa on it way somehow the warning sounded different coming from him the next part of the job and perhaps the more important one is getting the word out at a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever and trust in government is low convincing people to heed your warning especially the most severe of them might now be the weather forecaster s harder task the most serious warning when it come to rain is called a flash flood emergency and before harvey the houston office had issued that warning on only three occasion it would soon be used for a fourth berger sitting behind his spartan desk that afternoon anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat wa first among those who might listen and to whom others might listen about the coming storm he wasn t the government he wa a human being and somehow the warning sounded different to their ear coming from him the kind of measured voice that shine through in a crisis after he had written his ominous flood forecast three time he looked out his office window at one of the two garage he keep one of them wa bursting with new thing for his new house and he began ferrying box upstairs to his office filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixture a microwave and a tub in between trip he heard amanda making arrangement to take shelter with their daughter at her sister s house built on piling and tucked away from the wind berger would stay he would hunker down behind his wall of box with his pc and his reader now numbering in the hundred of thousand for the duration of the storm he knew that his city wa in serious trouble and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbor that it wa time for them to share his fear the weather started making an impression on berger in  when tropical storm allison came to town berger is from michigan but had gone to the university of texas to earn his astronomy degree he moved to houston for a girl first working weekend at the houston chronicle before becoming the paper s designated sciguy writing mostly about physic chemistry and astronomy he also wrote a little about the weather he had just bought his first house near white oak bayou on june  a friday night what wa it about storm and friday night he went out with some friend to see a bob schneider concert allison had passed through houston once already but now it returned to take a second run at the city berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out schneider a though there wa too much percussion in the mix after the concert he and his friend left to wander around midtown gawking at the water rising on the empty street berger wrote about the storm one of his story about the drowning death of ten of thousand of research animal in the basement of the texas medical center drew massive national readership he began having vision he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online his discussion could be more timely and interactive than the forecast printed in the paper itself and unlike tv meteorologist he needn t worry about rating or being available to viewer only at certain designated time in june  he started his own blog on the chronicle s site he didn t yet have any meteorological training he wa just someone who liked talking about the weather his colleague called him weather boy it wa not a compliment three month later came katrina then came rita and three year later hurricane ike berger s life could seem governed by storm even his first meeting with amanda whom he married in  came only a few week after allison s transformative rain he convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at mississippi state to earn his certification a a professional meteorologist modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hand berger wanted to make sure his hand were the right one when he left the chronicle to join ar technica in october of  he started space city weather the day after he opened up shop the remnant of hurricane patricia began clouding the sky of houston he wa supposed to go out for dinner with amanda he worried his reader would feel he d abandoned them in a time of need and he couldn t help writing a post his first forecast on space city weather wa for a flood now in august  the rain on harvey s opening night shocked even him they were biblical rain falling at a rate of  inch an hour would force most driver to pull over harvey would sometimes drop  it didn t look like water it looked like milk worse berger studied the model and the satellite imagery and if he knew anything in that moment listening to the rain against his window he knew that there wa so much more to come on saturday august  an hour after sunset the evening s first band of precipitation which on radar resembled the longest tentacle of an angry squid opened up over houston slowly crossing the city from west to east a predicted by the european model it stalled additional band trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first this created what meteorologist properly call a seething nexus of hate berger later wrote the now combined band extended more than  mile over galveston and deep into the too warm water of the gulf creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to houston by very early sunday morning harvey s enormous size began to tell and another band prepared to make it assault on the already flooded southern suburb the houston branch of the nw had issued it special emergency bulletin and in the adjacent office of emergency management the wall were being papered with call for water rescue people were drowning in the rain a sleepless berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post amanda and their daughter had been at her sister s house for several hour and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it he inserted the scene into his piece which went up at   am on sunday morning i wanted nothing more than to fall in her arm and tell her yes this wa it by god yes let s go to bed and forget this ever happened it had to be it surely it would not be it harvey would make true berger s most pessimistic projection and refuse to leave he would tell his reader that the rain would continue especially at night he would later hear that administrator at the houston methodist hospital and baylor college of medicine were among those looking to him for guidance he would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many at   pm on sunday berger finished writing a post that he titled houston we will get through this with the prospect of more rain you may feel hopeless or helpless or both from a mental health standpoint the uncertainty this brings add a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation i wish we could tell you when the rain will end but we can t here s one thing we are sure of however the rain will end after that the sun will come out more than a million people would visit space city weather on sunday alone hurricane harvey already had a name now it had it face harvey s unrelenting rain left so much underwater like these orchard in pecan grove on tuesday evening more than four day after the rain first started to fall berger would finally write it s over he had been nearly perfect in his forecast it hadn t been all that windy so there weren t many roof blown off or tree toppled except in those few cursed place that were also visited by tornado and there wasn t much local storm surge the water didn t come rushing through houston it didn t arrive in wall the way it did in new orleans with katrina one of the reason harvey directly killed  people many in their car instead of an estimated   people many in their bed harvey wa a cataclysmic rain event just a berger had feared he could have been wrong and his reader would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort but he had been right and thousand of his reader didn t have a downstairs anymore a month after the storm berger dropped into his hyundai hybrid and went for a drive he wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecast a though he could use the reminder that harvey really did do what it did to houston and to him by then the last part of weather analysis the accounting of the aftermath wa nearly complete it had rained so hard for so long that houston s swamp and reservoir and drainage canal filled up which meant that the city s kitchen and living room and den filled up next then the water drained away in the time in between it made an estimated   billion in property irreparably wet he headed south toward dickinson one of the worst hit area on some street every house had an enormous pile of debris out front everything that had been inside the house wa now outside of it rotting in the sun other street had been picked clean and they looked almost normal except that through their window berger could see that the otherwise pristine seeming house had been stripped down to the stud there wa a photograph that had made the round during the storm it wa of the flood soaked resident of a nursing home sitting on their lounger and walker water up to their chest it seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art on his tour berger decided to visit that nursing home la vita bella nearly everything that wasn t human in that photograph wa now sitting out in the yard the lamp the chair and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the pile of sodden sheetrock and carpet relic of a viral infamy they were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant loss a stuffed animal a deck of playing card a broken mirror a lipstick and a rouge a large print copy of marley amp me at   pm on sunday berger finished writing a post titled houston we will get through this berger had also lost a book in the flood before dawn on sunday lightning had lit up the sky and he could see that water had reached his garage he had mostly emptied one but not the other not the one that contained his old thing his diploma and his appetite for destruction poster and his box of book he raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and it bottom fell out a book titled from dawn to decadence by jacques barzun dropped into the water and disappeared berger had treasured that book a massive  year history of western civilization it french born author had died in texas in  barzun wa  year old and the book had been his life s work something about losing that particular book hit berger harder than it might have it wa a metaphor for how easily even our monument can be erased he had written about the loss of that book and other thing in a post that went up on ar technica early in the morning on august  the wednesday after the storm the post wa titled this is probably the worst u flood storm ever and i ll never be the same the cardboard box had failed he wrote and the book had dropped into the murk almost immediately a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away forever damn i loved that book an indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse berger started receiving email and note from his grateful reader they had saved some of their own treasure because of his warning and they felt they had a debt to settle a copy of from dawn to decadence wa eventually put into his hand by a stranger a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerve to give after the storm that book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office a tiny reminder of the thing that harvey had taken but also a reminder of the thing it had delivered the national weather service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy it is staffed by thousand of people by good and competent forecaster who care deeply about the weather and it effect on their community the nw can offer it best daily guess informed by their forecaster computer model and professional experience it can give warning and sound alarm but the nw can t talk about the weather the way human being talk about the weather it can t explore each of it uncertainty almost reveling in the sweeping possibility of hurricane and their animal behavior it can t riff more important when the weather is at it worst the national weather service can t comfort even though dan reilly and his colleague live and work in greater houston even though they were plenty concerned during harvey for their own family and home they can t issue a bulletin that say we re sick and tired of the rain just like everyone else they can t write the rain will end after that the sun will come out only someone like eric berger can do that providing a weather forecast that includes word like hope or sorry or maybe only someone like eric berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feel intimate and human scale applying the wisdom of satellite to deb walter and her doomed party only someone like eric berger looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he know that it won t be stopping anytime soon can speak to a family watching the water on it torturous rise to their door the wind threatening the entirety of their life and make them feel a little le alone in the storm update after this article went to press we heard from deb walter one of the many people who sought berger s advice just before hurricane harvey thanks to berger s forecast walter decided to cancel a house party she host every year for some member of alcoholic anonymous and ex con it turned out to be a good call although walter house wa spared the surrounding street flooded which would have stranded the guest there for three day these folk are hysterical she said a in funny and lovable but the type of people you invite to a party aren t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three day with she finally hosted the
