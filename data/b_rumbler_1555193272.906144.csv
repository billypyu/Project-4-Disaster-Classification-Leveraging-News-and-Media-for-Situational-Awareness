MANOJ MORE,"Written by MANOJ MORE | Pune | Published: December 21, 2017 5:58 am A speed-breaker in Wadgaonsheri area A survey, conducted by Pune City Police’s traffic unit, has revealed that of the 2,600 speed-breakers in the city, as many as 1,500 do not conform to the norms of the Indian Roads Congress. The speed-breakers are set up by the road department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “In a survey conducted across Pune, we have found that over 50 per cent of the speed-breakers are not as per IRC norms,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police, traffic, Ashok Morale. “The location of the speed-breakers is not much of a problem, but the way they are designed is. They are either too high or wide, or have other faults in their design,” he said. At least 1,500 speed-breakers of the 2,600 have problems, said Morale. Some of the rumbler strips laid out on concrete roads are also dangerous, said the DCP. “These rubber rumbler strips, which have nuts and bolts, are dangerous for commuters. When the rumbler strips are broken, the nuts and bolts get exposed, damaging vehicles which pass over them,” he said. The city had almost 700 such “faulty” rumbler strips, said Morale, adding, “Rumbler strips on concrete roads are dangerous but those on tar roads, made of tar, are preferable”. The issue of ‘faulty’ speed-breakers surfaced at a recent meeting of the Speed-Breaker Committee of the PMC, when civic activist Qaneez Sukhrani pointed out that only 295 speed-breakers were ‘legal’, or sanctioned by traffic police. “This is how things work in Pune… laid-down norms are trampled upon, putting the life of local residents at risk. When will the PMC wake up,” she said. Sukhrani said she had procured information about the ‘faulty’ speed-breakers by filing an application under the Right to Information Act. In its reply, the traffic police conceded that only 295 of the speed-breakers out of the 2,600 had been given a no-objection certificate. PMC often seeks an NoC from traffic police after laying the speed-breakers, not before, the traffic police stated in its reply. Superintendent Engineer, PMC, Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “Yes, we have been told by the traffic police that some of the speed-breakers are not as per IRC norms. We have decided to set up a committee which will study the design… we will get them redesigned as per IRC norms.” However, he disagreed that as many as 1,500 speed-breakers in the city didn’t match IRC norms. “We don’t believe the figure is so high, but we will carry out our survey…,” said Pawaskar, adding that the civic body also planned to remove ‘rubber’ rumbler strips that were damaged. “We will try to set up better speed-breakers across Pune city and we are working towards that end,” he said. PMC’s Additional Municipal Commissioner Prerna Deshbhartar, who is also on the Speed-Breaker Committee, said the civic body has already issued directives for conducting a survey of the existing speed-breakers. Civic activist Prashant Inamdar said there was a pressing need to set up a Speed-Breaker Approval Committee. “… such a committee is needed because it has come to light that speed-breakers in the city have been laid, either with permission from politicians, or all and sundry, without any planning,” he said. In a series of articles in November, Pune Newsline had highlighted how speed-breakers, among other factors, have been responsible for several two-wheeler riders losing their lives or sustaining serious injuries.

MANOJ MORE,"Written by MANOJ MORE | Pune | Published:November 16, 2017 1:05 pm One of the ‘abnormally-sized’ speed-breakers in Indrayani Nagar area (Manoj More) As one heads towards Indrayani Nagar area of Pimpri-Chinchwad from Telco Road, right at the entry point, one finds a chaotic maze of traffic. There is no road divider, and vehicles move in all possible directions. While there are no speed breakers here, a little way ahead, there are several, and they seem to be in all shapes and sizes. Many of them are marked in white, but the stripes have faded over time, making it difficult for two-wheeler riders and other motorists to spot them. This is even more difficult in the night, when visibility is poor. The upmarket area of Indrayani Nagar, which has seen rapid development in the last 10 years, is represented in the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation by Seema Savale, who is the chairperson of the civic Standing Committee. While Savale has reprimanded “negligent” officials over various issues during Standing Committee meetings, local residents said she has failed to take officials, who have failed to ensure safe speed-breakers in the area, to task. They point out that in last four-five years, at least two persons have lost their lives and several have been injured because of “abnormally-sized” speed-breakers. Sanjay S, a local resident, said, “There are too many speed-breakers in the Indrayani Nagar area… but there is no uniformity, they come in all shapes… I wonder whether they have been set up as per IRC norms…” “It becomes difficult to spot them, especially in the night, as the white markings on several speed-breakers have faded. Though some of them seem to pose no threat, a few pose serious risk to the life and limb of an unsuspecting rider,” said Sandeep Shirke, an industrialist. Seema Savale Another resident pointed out that there were no sign boards to indicate the presence of speed-breakers. According to civic activist Prashant Inamdar, there should be a prominent retro-reflective cautionary signboard —saying ‘Speed Breaker ahead’ — 40 metres in advance to enable the driver to slow down sufficiently before reaching the speed breaker. “Speed breakers should be painted with alternate black and white stripes as a visual warning,” he said. Another resident said that a speed-breaker, near Rakesh Sweet Mart, was too high for two-wheeler riders to negotiate it safely. There was also no sign of rumbler strips, which, say civic activists, neither poses a threat to the life a rider nor damages a two-wheeler. When queried on the issue, Savale said if there were complaints from two-wheeler riders, she would immediately hold a meeting and direct officials to set up speed-breakers that didn’t pose a threat to riders. “I will also ask why they are not exploring the possibility of putting rumbler strips,” she said. Savale said the PCMC has floated a tender for widening all the narrow roads in Indrayani Nagar area. “The deadline to file the tender ended today. Soon, the process for widening narrow roads to 100 feet will take off. We will also set up proper footpaths and a storm-water drain facility, and ensure that speed-breakers are designed properly,” she said.

Brendan Caldwell,"A man in black scrambles through the overgrowth, looking lost. So I shoot him. Puffs of bloody air erupt from his body, but he runs on. Behind him something explodes from a stray bullet – my bulet or somebody else’s? I don’t know. But the man in black keeps moving, dodging behind some trees, over a ridge. Behind me, a wall of wobbly energy closes in. I give chase to the man in black, and we come face to face in a dirt glade with a tall, odd structure that might be a radio tower. I lift my MP5 submachine gun and mow him down. Soon afterwards, the game ends. I’ve won. I won’t claim my performance in the upcoming 400-person battle royale game Mavericks: Proving Grounds was a heroic victory. Because there were only 5 people playing. It also lasted less than 5 minutes, and the man in black was the lead devleoper. He definitely let me win. We were playing a tiny slice of the game-in-progress. There was five of us, boxed into a shrinking area of 125m squared, with boxes of guns neatly placed close to our starting points. In the full game, Thompson tells me, you’ll drop in from above, thrown into a much larger map via drone. Like in other Battle Royales, you’ll see a lot of the map as you arrive. The technology they’re using to run the game – SpatialOS – has been bandied about as a way of making big worlds even bigger. World’s Adrift uses it to accommodate its sky pirates and grappling hook physics, for example. Here, it will theoretically allow the developer to render the map in greater detail as it rises to meet the feet of each slowly falling royale rumbler – adding to that strategic mid-air decision-making. Do I land near that wooded area? Or over by that large building? That’s the promise, anyway. Mavericks is far from completion, and as functional and good-looking as my forest feud was, it was all too brief to get a fleshed-out impression beyond “it’s a lot like Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds ”. But the developers are keen to stress the features that will make it more exciting than Brendan Greene’s bullet scavenging sim – and it isn’t just the 300 extra people. “More players doesn’t necessarily mean more fun,” says James Thompson, CEO of Atuomaton. “It’s not about your twitch shooting skills. It’s about how you inspect the environment.” To this end, players will leave footprints in certain areas (for example, a muddy road). Grass and plantlife will also stay parted if you’ve tramped through it, and weather will affect how much these things make an impact. A rain storm will cause players to leave more wet footprints behind, for instance. I didn’t see any of this in action because I am too stupid to look down, but some journo colleagues have confirmed it was in there. There are also plans for buildings and props that can be easily destroyed, which would mean wreckage and debris left behind after a fight but also more significant changes to your surroundings. They’re aiming for “ Rainbow Six Siege levels of destruction”. “You can go so far as blowing up a bridge,” says Thompson, hinting at a world that can change in drastic and permanent ways. Imagine trying to escape from that encroaching wall of death, only to have your quickest escape route destroyed by another player. Again, this is the promise – the most impressive thing I destroyed in my mayfly playthrough, aside from some explosive barrels, was a single empty water bottle sitting on a rusty oil drum. Still, this potential for “tracking” your enemies or simply noting their presence will appeal to players of Battlegrounds, for whom the closest thing to a footprint is a door left ajar. There is a sense of competition between Battle Royale games. Fortnite ’s battle royale mode upset Plunkbat developers Bluehole so much so they publicly complained about it. I ask Thompson if he sees Mavericks poaching players from Plunkbat, since it seems to be boasting a very similar set-up. “I feel like if you look at Playerunknown’s … [it] is a very limited game. I think Mavericks is a much richer game than Playerunknown’s. “We believe that a back drop of a fictional world leads to a better experience… We also see the world as an evolving world.” By this he means the larger world outside of the battle royale. After all, this 400-person countryside arena is just a game mode within a 1000-person MMO-style open world. This will have a social hub, which they describe as “similar to a town in World of Warcraft” rather than the smaller, tight-knit hubs of Destiny 2 or Call of Duty: WWII. Here there will be player-to-player trading and other activities. There aren’t plans to add lots of game modes, however, as they’re wary of splitting the players. As far as loot and in-game rewards go, Thomspon answers my question about loot boxes in a way that is both cautious and non-committal. “We’re generally avoiding loot boxes,” he says. “We’re currently looking at alternatives…” That sense of a game still under construction extends to the rest of the battle royale mode too. They hope to invigorate the “mid game” of these massive deathmatches, says Thompson, by throwing in objectives. Players will be challenged to capture a particular point on the map, for example. And success will mean rewards at the end of the match, even if they should die far from the final circle of death. The idea is that this will liven up those too-quiet moments from Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, and give folks another reason to play, besides the all-or-nothing pursuit of a hot chicken dinner. However, like everything else, they’re still experimenting with these ideas. We still don’t know exactly what these mid-game objectives will involve. It’s much too early to say if Mavericks will beat Playerunknown to death with its own frying pan. But it is certainly taking a brave run at it. Although Automaton say they’re confident about their capability to host so many players at once, the real test will only arrive when it comes to early access. To besmirch this cautious preview with a colourful metaphor – we can see some of the footprints, yes, but we still don’t know where they lead.","A man in black scrambles through the overgrowth, looking lost.

Update 3.1 contains the 5v5 Ranked and Draft modes, the new hero Tony, the return of Halcyon Days, and a bunch of balance changes as well. Super Evil Megacorp is working on a video covering Ranked and Draft to explain more, but expect the modes to function similarly to how they did for 3v3. With 5v5 bringing massive changes to the way that palyers interacted wtih the game, giving folks a few weeks to just play 5v5 and get used to how things operate seems like a superior option in comparison to just opening up Ranked, and creating that casual/competitive split right away. Now, everyone's gotten to mingle and learn, and can check out Ranked and use the Draft well based on experience. SEMC does say that season transitions will impact Ranked progression for both 3v3 and 5v5 modes. Wondering how the new 5V5 Ranked &amp; Draft mode will work?

Manoj Dattatrye More,"The accident spot (Express Photo by Manoj More) Last week’s accident, in which a nine-year-old boy was killed by a speeding minibus, on the overbridge connecting Nashik Phata with Gurav Pimple has angered the residents of the area who have been complaining about the lack of safety measures on the stretch. Local people said they approached the civic administration several times with requests to implement safety measures on the overbridge, which often sees vehicles moving at a speed of 80 kmph to 100 kmph. In the latest accident, Pratik Sawant, a Class III student studying at a civic school, was hit by a speeding minibus while trying to cross the road with his 22-year-old cousin, Suraj Chandanshive. The impact was such that Pratik’s head was severed from his body. “We were walking on the concrete platform of the BRTS route. Pratik was following us. I saw a minibus coming at a high speed from Bhosari side and entering the BRTS corridor, breaking rules. I was trying to signal at the bus driver, asking him to stop. But he did not pay heed. Out of fear, Pratik tried to cross the BRTS corridor. The speeding bus hit him so hard that his head was blown away quite a distance,’’ said Suraj. Pratik was from Anantnagar in Gurav Pimple. Both parents of the child are differently-abled migrant labourers. “Since both of us are disabled and Pratik had no physical deformities, our entire existence rested on him. We had come all the way here from Beed to educate him so that he could carry the family’s burdens on his shoulders,” Pratik’s father Parmeshwar Sawant told The Indian Express. It is a hand-to-mouth existence for the family with the couple earning around Rs 8,000 a month working on construction sites. They pay Rs 5,000 as monthly rent for a one-room flat in Gurav Pimple. The couple has a daughter who studies in Class VII. The accident spot is considered a dangerous stretch on the road by the residents of Nashik Phata and Kasarwadi areas. Local people said accidents were routine on the stretch. Around a month back, a woman was killed while crossing the road. “Vehicles come at a breakneck speed from Bhosari side as well as Gurav Pimple side. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and traffic policemen have done little to slow down over-speeding vehicles. Whatever measures have been taken are half-hearted,” said Rajesh Tope, a resident of the area. A visit to the spot revealed that the PCMC had put up rumbler strips, along with a signage warning vehicle drivers about the stretch. But they are placed so low that hardly any vehicle slows down. Local residents had complained to the civic administration about a year back. But no action was taken. About two months ago, PCMC Chief Shravan Hardikar had directed civic officials to look into the complaints. But nothing came of it. On Saturday, Hardikar assured The Indian Express that he would look into the issue. He, however, said that the PCMC had decided to provide a monthly pension of Rs 2,000 to Pratik’s parents. Manav Kamble of the Manav Haqq Suraksha Samiti demanded that the PCMC gives a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the parents. “This is a clear-cut act of negligence. If the PCMC was told about the danger to public life and still it refused to act, then the PCMC should at least compensate the family.” BJP MLA Laxman Jagtap, president of party’s Pimpri-Chinchwad unit, said it was a serious act of negligence. “I will speak to the civic chief and seek an explanation from him,” he said. Former Standing Committee Chairperson Seema Savale, who had promised to set up rumbler strips on the city roads, said she will take up the issue at the general body meetings. Local corporator Asha Shendge said they will convene a meeting with the civic chief and other officials and ask them to implement safety measures on all city roads. Sub inspector Namrata Davare of Bhosari police station said they were looking for CCTV footage to catch the driver of the speeding minibus. The vehicle had illegally entered the BRTS corridors, the police said.

https://www.facebook.com/pcgamermagazine,"The fastest cars in GTA Online include the Pegassi Zentorno, the Annis RE-7B, the Grotti X80 Proto, and the Dewbauchee Vagner. But the best car in the Grand Theft Auto series is the Bravado Banshee. Following its first appearance in Grand Theft Auto 3, the Banshee has featured in every GTA game since—including Grand Theft Auto Advance, and the crime sim's Liberty City and Vice City Stories spin-offs. Moreover, its likeness reflects various models from real world manufacturer Dodge, therefore it technically shares the same DNA as the original game's Beast GTS and GTA 2's Rumbler. It's sleek, fast and has gotten me out more sticky situations than Carl Johnson's had takeaway dinners and bad haircuts. I love it. Here's my homage to the Banshee as it's appeared on PC over three decades, with a nod to its formative top-down cousins. Grand Theft Auto's Beast GTS For me, the Beast GTS epitomised Grand Theft Auto's sense of greed. I could be driving any other vehicle, during a timed mission, and I'd still happily go out of my way to chase down a passing Beast GTS, accost its driver, and claim it as my own. Taking what's not rightfully yours of course quickly became a central tenet of the GTA series, and I cut my teeth on the first's twin-striped sports car. Based on the real world Dodge Viper GTS, the Beast combines style and speed at the expense of durability. Successfully outrunning a Liberty City or San Andreas squad car, though, makes the latter seem less important. Memorable mission: One of my favourite things about the first Grand Theft Auto at the time was its random missions—particularly those doled out at arbitrary pay phones or from inside stolen cars. I mean, why was the owner of this vehicle giving you orders beyond, you know, 'Can I have my bloody car back, please?' No matter, the above footage courtesy of GTA Gamer shows off the Beast at its best. GTA 2's Rumbler With an ensemble of new vehicles, Grand Theft Auto 2's car count jumped from 59 to 69 over its forerunner. In doing so, GTA 2 sadly dropped the original's Beast GTS—but instead replaced it with the 1997 Dodge Copperhead-aping Rumbler. Cutting a chunkier frame, the Rumbler isn't quite as fast as its Beast predecessor, but it handles like a dream. Furthermore, it also has two Go-Faster stripes and looks really cool in green and white as shown above. Memorable mission: During the Gang Land Nonsense mission, I inadvertently led a squad of hostile Zaibatsu gang members to my in-favour Red Necks' trailer park HQ. Here, I realised warring factions in GTA 2 indeed fought each other regardless of whether I hung around or not. I was ultimately chased by an enemy Z-Type, but my trusty Rumbler ensured I escaped to safety. Grand Theft Auto 3: the Banshee's debut Housed within the glazed showroom of 8-Ball's Auto Yard, the first 3D iteration of the Banshee is a beauty. As Grand Theft Auto 3's story unfolds, the player is given access to faster cars—not least the Yakuza Stinger—but seeking out this topless belter early on is always worth the detour. What's more, whenever I chose to steal this 'un, I'd shoot out the garage window, as opposed to driving through it, to ensure my new ride didn't take any unnecessary damage. And I doubt I was the only one who did this. The Banshee's GTA 3 incarnation echoes several American sports cars, but best reflects the first generation Dodge Viper RT/10. Like its spiritual forerunners, the flashy speed stripe makes it shine. Memorable mission: As soon as I learned of the Banshee's location, I used it throughout GTA 3's first island missions. It made for the perfect getaway car as I fled from Triads and Tribulations. Vice City's pivot to Corvette Unlike its Dodge-inspired pals, Vice City's '80s flavoured Banshee mimics the real world's Corvette C4, complete with a twin exhaust. Arguably not as glamorous as some of VC's other briefs, the Banshee handled that windy bend outside the Malibu Club with ease and could still out run police with the best of the them. As such, this made it my go-to every time. Memorable mission: Cop Land. Memorable, but definitely not in a good way. Simply because I died about a gazillion times trying to beat it. Despite Lance's insistence we drive a squad car to the mall, I eventually realised doing so with a regular car made the escape and respray part of the mission so much easier. A five-star wanted level is never fun, but the Banshee definitely softened the blow. San Andreas—'90s Viper San Andreas's interpretation of the Banshee returns to its first gen Dodge Viper RT/10 roots. Despite GTA:SA taking place years before Grand Theft Auto 3, its appearance in both is largely the same. And equipping these beauties with nitrous oxide here is a sight to behold. As noted by the GTA Wiki, the San Andreas Banshee is one of the few cars that lets CJ kick the driver—as opposed to punching them, or slamming their head against the wheel—before stealing their car. I cannot stress enough how much more fun this made doing so. Memorable mission: My fondest memory of San An's Banshee happened by accident. I'd heard so much about the size of the game's map prior to launch, and decided to put it to the test from outset. After arriving at Grove Street for the first time, I set off on my own for Las Venturas. After a lot of swimming and hightailing it from the law, I happened upon a Banshee. I stole it, obviously, and proceeded to tear up the LV highway before hitting a lamp post and spiralling in a blaze of glory. It was like an episode of Cops. And this was indeed a pretty big map. Not a formal mission, obviously, but great fun all the same. Grand Theft Auto 4's new generation By this point, I'd become accustomed to the series' Banshee and was not let down by its 2008 HD universe introduction. I mean, how could I be? Look at that beauty up there. Although not classed as a sports car in Grand Theft Auto 4, this version mimics both the second generation Dodge Viper SR and the fourth generation Dodge Viper ZB. The first type to boast the Bravado manufacturer name, it comes in convertible form or with a hard top roof—with some variants also packing chrome roll bars. As reliable as ever, GTA 4's Banshee is the quintessential getaway car. Memorable mission: And as fate would have it, that's exactly how I escaped from the crime sim's Holland Nights mission. After tracking Clarence Little down, I decided to drop him in cold blood because I'm a hard bastard. I then took off in the smoothest ride in Liberty City. Grand Theft Auto 5's attention to detail Grand Theft Auto 5's instalment of the Bravado Banshee is its most refined. Similar in appearance to its GTA 4 variation, this one's interior mimics the real world Dodge Viper more than ever. As highlighted by its GTA Wiki page, this Banshee comes with vertically-aligned speedometers—which is a staple feature of the Viper. Memorable mission: I'm sort of cheating here, in that this memory doesn't come from the base game—but a Bravado Banshee was my getaway car when I robbed a string of banks unarmed by posing as a journalist in a GTA 5 roleplaying server. Not only is this one of my favourite ever Grand Theft Auto 5 experiences, it's also some of the most fun I've ever had playing any videogame. GTA Online: Bansheeeit! Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6 My pride and joy. The apex of Grand Theft Auto sports cars. My own customised Bravado Banshee. This pink, white and black beauty comes with spoilers, turbo, sports brakes, a re-tuned engine and custom tires. It comes with neon strips that Phil and Samuel think are tacky but what do they really know? And it comes with a novelty horn that plays Sergei Prokofiev's Montagues and Capulets and/or that Sia tune from the turn of the millennium. Perfection. Memorable mission: Every single mission I undertake. When I'm behind the wheel of this baddie, there ain't no stopping me.

Chris Burns,"It’s time to feel the rumble on all your parts – so says Razer, and their newest ecosystem brand Razer HyperSense. Razer HyperSense is to haptic feedback what Razer Chroma is to multicolor LED lighting. The first demonstration of this system was presented to us at CES 2019 with a collection of devices made by Razer, Lofelt, and SUBPAC, too. One of these products is already on the market in its current form: the Razer Nari Ultimate – a pair of headphones with Razer HyperSense inside.
The Razer HyperSense setup we got the opportunity to experience at CES 2019 stemmed from THX Spatial Audio. Razer owns THX, and with THX Spatial Audio, they’ve got the “IF THIS” part of the equation for Razer Hypsersense. The “THEN THAT” part of HyperSense is haptic feedback – rumbling in a variety of devices, each one according to a certain part of the source sound. 
THX Spatial Audio outputs a set of signals. With a game like we experienced at CES 2019, this meant things like: one signal for footsteps, one signal for gunfire. Another signal for loud impact sounds and loud sounds coming from behind the player, and full 360 ambient feedback for the headphones.
When in the game the weapon is fired, the mouse reacts. Each different sort of event – shotgun, machine-gun, rocket launcher – each had a different sort of feedback. Razer called this “simulated tactile feedback based on weapon of choice.” This setup was made for a right-handed individual, so the mouse also intercepted sounds from the right – turning those into a bit of feedback too.
On the left was a section of keyboard wrist rest with haptics from Lofelt. The keyboard didn’t rumble – that’d be too crazy. But for the left wrist, “sensory perception of footsteps or events incoming from the left.” Both the mouse and the wrist rest are new Razer devices – not necessarily final products just yet, but certainly in conceptual testing.
The chair was made with Subpac. Subpac makes their own back rumbler wearable – here it’s basically a chair with that rumbler already embedded within. Much like wearing a virtual reality headset tricks you (or brings you in willingly) into believing you’re immersed in a virtual environment with your eyes (and sometimes your ears), the chair, the headset, the wrist rest, and the mouse created an epic setup for games like DOOM.
Playing a first-person shooter is the obvious first place one might go with a setup like this. We played some relatively tame action first, then dropped in to DOOM. Even after just a few minutes, it was apparent we’d entered a new world. If anything can open up a whole new door in gaming (that isn’t VR,) this is it. And with VR, it’ll be even better!
Right now we’re limited to the headset – that’s already out on the market. But soon – as soon as possible, one would hope – we’ll see a whole lot more – full systems, Razer approved. This demonstration of multiple Razer HyperSense devices was like waking up from a long sleep, with a rumble! A rumble that went marrow deep!","It’s time to feel the rumble on all your parts – so says Razer, and their newest ecosystem brand Razer HyperSense.

James Keith,"Ukrainian-born singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Delena released her new self-titled EP last month, quickly racking up tens of thousands of streams. One of the highlights of the project was ""Holy Ground"", a piano-led pop epic with plenty of potential to propel her career forward. Now the track has been picked up by London drum &amp; bass duo Revaux who have put it into an entirely different context, adding some skittish D&amp;B breaks and a snarling bass line. If you were a fan of the original you may not have predicted it would have such dancefloor potential, but that's why Revaux have become such an esteemed duo in the UK drum &amp; bass scene.

Stuart Berman,"There’s a fine line between encouraging an intra-band democracy and having an identity crisis. As a four-piece with four singers, Melbourne’s Deaf Wish are liable to sound like four different bands. On their 2015 Sub Pop debut, Pain, they sought catharsis through any means necessary: clanging noise brutalism, hoarse-throat hardcore, frazzled indie rock, distortion-soaked psych. But it was one of those albums that sounded like the band was getting its shit together in real time. Once you got through Pain ’s scatterbrained first side, you could sense Deaf Wish learning to let their melancholy melodies lead the way, with singer-guitarists Jensen Tjhung and Sarah Hardiman settling into a familiar Thurston/Kim dynamic. Lithium Zion, their second Sub Pop album and fifth overall, picks up right where they left off—though not without some shake-ups along the way. After a decade of bashing out makeshift-space recordings, the band graduated to a proper studio, with Total Control ’s Mikey Young overseeing the mixes. They also bid adieu to bassist Nick Pratt, the member responsible for their fiercest circle-pit stompers. But if Deaf Wish are still very much fueled by a love for frayed-nerve noise, there’s a consistency of vision here that distinguishes Lithium Zion from the band’s caterwauling back catalog. That evolution is apparent in the band’s choice of opening tracks. On Pain, you were instantly confronted by the impenetrable post-punk of “The Whip,” a song that climaxes with the sort of hammering assault that can make you see stars. But with “Easy,” on Lithium Zion, Deaf Wish make the initiation process, well, easy, by hitching their churning guitars to a cascading, “Tomorrow Never Knows”-style drum beat, striking a perfect balance between dissonance and groove. Hardiman’s “FFS” follows, with two exhilarating minutes of restless agitation and revved-up noise-punk that demonstrate the greater focus in effect. Alas, the specter of Sonic Youth is impossible to avoid in these songs. But the album doesn’t mimic Deaf Wish’s spiritual forebears so much as it imagines an alternate history for them, one where the rock formalism of Goo and Dirty became the band’s defining characteristic, rather than a blip in their sprawling discography. (Not only is Lithium Zion ’s title track an asphalt-ripping instrumental like Goo ’s “ Mildred Pierce,” it’s even slotted in a similar side-two position.) Yet there’s an absurdist sensibility at play here that rarely cut through Sonic Youth’s ultra-cool veneer: The needling mid-tempo rumbler “The Rat Is Back” finds Tjhung curling up with his cat to fend off an invasive rodent; “Hitachi Jackhammer” opens with Tjhung and Hardiman reciting ad copy for the titular product, before unleashing a juddering punk squall that conjures its operational qualities. But more than just harnessing the band’s unbridled energy into tightly coiled rockers, Lithium Zion displays a greater willingness to play Deaf Wish’s singers off one another, projecting a deeper sense of camaraderie. Like Pratt before him, new bassist Lee Parker serves as a caustic counterpoint to Tjhung and Hardiman’s disaffected sneers, but his sensibility meshes more naturally with theirs. On “Deep Blue Cheated,” Parker transforms the band into an evil twin to fellow Melburnians Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, until the song’s hyper locomotive thrust is cooled by Hardiman’s soothing counter-melody, a trick she deploys throughout the record. As Lithium Zion confirms, the story of Deaf Wish’s evolution is very much the story of Hardiman’s own. Her increasingly versatile vocals have brought greater emotional depth to their music, from the haunting spoken-word passage that interrupts the PJ Harvey -esque “Afraid for You” or her sad-eyed duet with drummer Daniel Twomey on careening closer “Smoke.” And the swooning “Birthday,” a shot of Brill Building-via-Knitting Factory melodic discord, counts as the most affecting pop song in the band’s canon to date. Deaf Wish may still be suckers for hair-raising noise, but the real thrills on Lithium Zion come when they embrace nuance.","The Melbourne quartet’s fifth album doesn’t counteract any Sonic Youth comparisons, but it does conjure an alternate history where the rock formalism of Goo and Dirty became the band’s defining sound.",2018-08-09T05:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Pitchfork.com'}",Deaf Wish: Lithium Zion,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deaf-wish-lithium-zion/,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b6b30861303337201621742/2:1/w_1000/lithiumzion.jpg,,Pitchfork.com,rumbler,1

MANOJ MORE,"Written by MANOJ MORE | Pune | Published: December 4, 2017 1:00 am Based on Pune Newsline report highlighting the death of a two-wheeler rider due to a faulty speed-breaker, Minister of State for Home Ranjit Patil directed Pune Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla to ‘act immediately’ in the matter. (Express Photo) AFTER “ignoring” what activists say the “threat” to the lives of road users, especially two-wheeler riders, the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have decided to review the state of dangerously laid out speed-breakers within their respective jurisdictions and come up with speed bumps that do not harm the road users. “The Speed-breaker Committee set up by the Pune Municipal Corporation which held its third meeting on Saturday has decided to take a hard look at the existing speed-breakers and revise them as per the Indian Road Congress (IRC) norms,” said Rajendra Raut, in-charge of PMC’s road department. On the other hand, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “Wherever there are complaints regarding the speed-breakers creating problems for road users, we will change them..,” he said. PCMC standing committee chairperson Seema Savale said, “Speed-breakers or rumbler in Pimpri-Chinchwad would be set up in a such a manner that they do not lead to accidents.” The development — which follows a series of reports carried by Pune Newsline since last month — is heartening for two-wheeler riders and motorists in Pune who have been facing the nightmare because of the “abnormal-sized” speed-breakers laid out throughout the length and breadth of Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Not just the size of speed-breakers, civic activists said several norms relating to setting up of the speed-breakers have been flouted by PMC and PCMC officials, with municipal commissioners of both the civic bodies not paying serious attention to the stark danger to the lives of Puneites. In Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad, in first nine months of this year, 175 two-wheeler riders have lost their lives. “Unwieldy” and faded speed-breakers are being cited by the police as one of the reasons behind the large number of deaths. This prompted Minister of State of Home Ranjit Patil to issue directions to Pune Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla to “act immediately” in the matter. She is yet to act. On Sunday, PMC officials said the IRC was apparently busy formulating new norms for speed-breakers. “As soon as the IRC comes out with the norms, we will also revise the norms relating to speed-breakers. PMC is committed to ensuring safe speed-breakers for citizens,” Raut said. Hardikar said PCMC too was following the IRC norms and would take closer look at the existing speed-breakers to resolve citizens’ complaints. While the PMC and the PCMC get down to doing a rethink on the state of speed-breakers, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ashok Morale said, “It is true that several norms relating to speed-breakers are not followed. For instance, it is very difficult to come across warning boards 40 metres before a speed-breakers in Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad. They might have been there at a few odd places, but I haven’t come across anyone of them, at least at major chowks,” he said. Echoing the views, civic activist Prashant Inamdar, who is a member of the PMC’s Speed-Breaker Committee, said, “I too haven’t found signages or warning boards which are mandatory for speed-breakers. If they have been placed, then they might be hiding behind some trees or poles,” he said. PMC officials responded by asserting that there were signages at a few places, but could not provide the exact number of signages. When asked whether PMC and PCMC consult traffic police before setting up speed-breakers, DCP Morale said, “Sometimes they take NoC from them, sometimes NoC is sought after the speed-breakers have been set up.” PMC officials said it was traffic police which should play active role in setting up of safe and appropriate speed-breakers. “We all need to work jointly to come up with safe speed-breakers,” said Morale. PCMC standing committee chairperson Seema Savale conceded that the PCMC had not set up the Speed-Breaker Committee. “I have asked road department officials to make a detailed presentation regarding speed-breakers in the next meeting. On both walkability of footpaths and safe speed-breakers, I have sought detailed presentation. And, after this, we will take a decision for constructing speed-breakers that are safe and do not cause accidents,” Savale said. Inamdar said he has been chasing the speed-breakers issue for too long. “Municipal commissioners and standing committee chairpersons of both civic bodies should play active role in this, otherwise road users will continue to suffer due to haphazard, indiscriminate and dangerously laid-out speed-breakers in PMC and PCMC areas,” he said.

Express News Service,"Work on the BRTS route on the 13-km Dapodi-Nigdi stretch has been delayed by years. THE MUCH-DELAYED BRTS route from Dapodi to Nigdi on Pune-Mumbai Highway has been postponed again. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had planned to make the route operational before January 26. Vijay Bhojne, in-charge of PCMC BRTS cell, said a IIT-Bombay team had conducted a day and night safety audit of the route and suggested some amendments. “We had implemented all the suggestions that were made earlier. This time, however, there were minor requirements, which we have fulfilled,” he said. On the objections raised by PCMC Standing Committee Chairperson Seema Savale, Bhojne said, “The IIT-Bombay has approved the steps we have taken to ensure that the exit and entry of vehicles neither hampers the functioning of the route nor causes accidents. We have placed rumbler strips and will place wardens at the spot to ensure smooth flow of traffic.” Savale had said that the entry and exit points on the route were dangerous. “There is a threat to the life of pedestrians and other road users on this route. Even if one accident takes place or one life is lost, I will be forced to file an FIR against the PCMC administration. This is because I have forewarned the administration that they should not go ahead with the route,” she had said. Bhojne, however, said a report in this regard will be presented before the Bombay High Court on February 5. “We expect that the high court will give its approval and, soon after, the route will take off,” he added. Work on the BRTS route on the 13-km Dapodi-Nigdi stretch has been delayed by three years. The tender process for the route was carried out in 2013 and work orders were given in 2014. The PCMC and PMPML, which failed to get the route on track, have been under fire from commuters and activists in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Meanwhile, several activists in Pimpri-Chinchwad have also raised objections against the route. Activist Deepak Vichare said, “Just when we thought we have got wider and better roads and traffic chaos would no longer be an issue, the PCMC has shrunk the size of the roads by unnecessarily setting up BRTS. With Pune Metro work underway on the same route, there will be total chaos.” However, the PCMC administration said it was determined to go ahead with the project. “We don’t have the authority to scrap the project. The chairperson will have to approach the appropriate authority in this connection,” Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar told Pune Newsline. In the last three years, the PCMC has planned to launch the route at least four times and had to postpone it every time. The PCMC has contended that the delay has been due to the safety audit ordered by the Bombay High Court. A resident had approached the high court, which had asked the PCMC to take all safety measures before starting the route. Accordingly, Bhojne said, “We appointed IIT-Bombay to carry out the survey and suggest safety measures. The PCMC has planned four BRTS routes. Currently, the Nashik Phata to Wakad route and Sangvi-Kiwale route are operational. PCMC claims both the routes have been successfully implemented.” “Not a single accident has taken place on this route in two years. this and other relevant facts have been submitted before the court,” he added. PCMC claimed both Nashik Phata to Wakad and Sangvi-Kiwale routes have achieved major success in terms of ridership and revenue. While Nashik Phata to Wakad has seen a rise of 67 per cent in daily ridership and 43 per cent in revenue per month, the other route has seen a jump of 34 per cent in revenue and 38 per cent in ridership.

Ajay Jadhav,"Written by Ajay Jadhav | Pune | Published: June 26, 2018 10:00:23 am The government has ordered installation of proper lights on bridges. (Express photo) Based on the recommendations made by the commission appointed to inquire into bridge collapse in Mahad, the Maharashtra government has directed the respective authorities to remove trees on the structure to strengthen the old arch bridges on roads, undertake frequent repairs and audit every three years. It has also ordered installation of proper lights on bridge with blinkers on sides, cat eye on passage to ensure there is no repeat of the accident like the one on the Savitri river on the Mumbai-Goa highway. On the night of August 2, 2016, two buses and around 10 private vehicles fell in the Savitri river after a British-era bridge got washed away near Mahad on the Mumbai-Goa highway, killing nearly 30 people. A one-member commission of a retired High Court judge was constituted to undertake the inquiry into the incident and it suggested measures to avoid such accidents in future. In a government resolution, the state government said there are old arch bridges on several roads in the state that are in the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department, rural development department, municipal corporation and councils. Few are made of stones and few of concrete. “The measures suggested by the commission should be followed to avoid repeat of accident due to collapse of bridges,” it said. Additional city engineer of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Srinivas Bonala said there are eight British-Era bridges on the Mula-Mutha river passing through the city. “The civic body has already started taking care of the old bridges. There are total of 52 bridges, including flyovers and railway over bridges, in the city. The PMC has completed the repair of old arch bridges and has appointed an agency to carry out structural audit of all bridges that are at least 25 years old.” The government order also says that the maximum water level during a flood situation should be painted on the pillar of the bridge every year and if the level has increased, then it should be registered with the local civic body. Trees or plants on any part of the bridge’s structure should be uprooted and chemicals should be used to ensure that the trees do not grown again, if they pose a threat to the structure. Visibility on the old bridges should be increased during night time by installing proper lighting system. There should be blinkers on both sides of the bridge and cat eyes or road studs on both sides and the median, it says. Further the GR has suggested that there should be retro-reflective display boards put up permanently in a place before the start of the bridge with detailed information, like single lane or narrow bridge, speed limit and submersible bridge, which the authorities should ensure are in good condition before the onset of every monsoon. The speed limit of vehicles on old and narrow bridges should be ensured by putting rumbler strips before the start of bridge with a display board indicating it. The authorities should take appropriate decision to close the bridge for vehicles by continuously reviewing the flood situation during monsoon, it said. According to the GR, there should be special technical audit of the bridge after every three to five years, as per the guidelines of the Indian Road Congress. The guidelines of Indian Railways Bridge manual should be followed to ensure proper condition of the railway bridges. The bridges should be repaired if there are some problems observed in the structure and it should ensure that there is sufficient cushioning on the arch bridges to avoid damage to the arch. The foundation of pillars should be covered with concrete if there is damage. The pillar should be repaired as and when required while the information of the engineer responsible for the repair and its date should be registered. There should be proper care taken while constructing parallel bridge, along an existing bridge so that it does not get affected, the GR said.

MANOJ MORE,"Written by MANOJ MORE | Pune | Updated: November 13, 2017 1:38 pm (Left) Guardian Minister Girish Bapat and MP Anil Shirole. While Minister of State for Home and Urban Development Ranjit Patil has acted promptly on a Pune Newsline report highlighting the death of a two-wheeler rider due to a faulty speed-breaker, Pune’s District Guardian Minister Girish Bapat and MP Anil Shirole don’t seem to have any concrete ideas on the issue. When queried, Bapat said three days ago, he had held meetings with traffic police and told them to take action regarding violations of norms by two-wheeler riders and other motorists. However, when asked whether he had any concrete plans to save the lives of two-wheeler riders, Bapat said, “If you have any plans and suggestions, we will place them during our next meeting.” Similarly, Shirole did not sound convincing when asked if he had any plans to stop the frequent loss of lives on Pune’s roads. “Baghu, kay karta yeil (Let’s see what we can do)”, he said. Last year, when he was contacted about the large number of deaths of two-wheeler riders on Pune roads, he had made the same comment. Though 175 “helmet-less” riders have died on Pune’s roads, Shirole said, “Helmets should be voluntary.” D G Baliga, civic activist, said Shirole should think twice before making such comments. “Of the 175 helmet-less bikers who died, at least 100 lives could have been saved if the riders had worn helmets,” he said. On Friday, Patil had sent a clipping of a Pune Newsline report — on police filing a case against the dead rider, not negligent officials — with notings, directing Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla to act immediately. The minister’s office said Pune residents should alert him whenever such incidents take place. Civic activists have demanded that a case of culpable homicide should be filed against negligent civic officials, to ensure that in the future, the Pune Municipal Corporation comes up with proper speed-breakers or rumbler strips. They also demanded that each and every accident should be investigated and action should be taken, against drivers for rash driving or civic officials for infrastructural deficiencies. While Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla had said that she will act on the issue, PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar had said guilty officials would have to face action. However, civic activists and Pune residents said this kind of “action” was taking place because a minister, who is not from Pune, has decided to look into the problems of the city. “But what is our own minister, Girish Bapat, doing ? Isn’t it his job, as the district guardian minister, to guard the lives of Pune residents,” asked Vivek Velenkar of the Sajag Nagrik Manch. Velenkar pointed out that as Bapat was the district guardian minister, departments like civic, police and collectorate came under him. “He should hold meetings regularly and seek plans, and ensure their implementation, to protect the lives of citizens on Pune roads… he has to monitor the work of civic and police officials to get the plans implemented,” said Velenkar. Human rights activist Aseem Sarode, an advocate, said, “… Our minister and MP do not seem to be showing any seriousness or sense of urgency to help save the lives of Pune residents.” “Where are the funds going ? Pune residents have the right to know whether they are spending their funds in ensuring proper and safe roads,” he added. Sarode said the minister and the MP should work as a team, and work hard, to resolve Pune’s problems. Qaneez Sukhrani, of the Viman Nagar Citizen’s Forum, said, “We elect them for five years but they don’t value our vote. Do the minister and MP not travel on the roads used by citizens and observe the bad condition they are in ? Do they shut their eyes when they travel ? Are they not aware of the daily loss of innocent lives on Pune’s dangerous roads”?

Claire Lampen,"Strange noises drag all New Yorkers from peaceful slumber at some point: The cracking thud of what really sounds like a bowling ball dropped on your upstairs neighbors' tile floor at 3 a.m.; feline scrapes; grumbling garbage trucks mauling long rows of parked cars; drunk people yelling outside your window; the shrill drone of a siren, seemingly timed for the exact moment you begin to drift off. 
You take all the precautions, plugging your ears with foam and burying your head under all the pillows, and you foolishly think you've beaten the caterwaul when here comes the ambulance, screeching around the corner only to find its way blocked back the aforementioned trash hauler. The two commence a howling argument, and you know you will never sleep again.
Some have suggested that we don't have to live this way. On Wednesday, City Council members Carlina Rivera (representing Gramercy, Flatiron, and the East Village) and Helen Rosenthal (representing the Upper West Side) introduced a bill proposing that New York City squad cars, fire trucks, and ambulances switch over to a two-tone siren—the ""'more melodic' European-style"" Hi-lo siren, as Joseph Davis, senior director of Mount Sinai's emergency medical services, put it to the Wall Street Journal. Rivera and Rosenthal's bill provides for a two-year transition period, and would also cap the acceptable maximum siren sound level. 
All of that sounds pretty okay, but would a more subtle siren do enough? Shouldn't a siren do the most? Sirens, according to the Journal, are annoying by design, made to aggravate the same part of the ear as a baby's wail so that you pay attention. They also have to slice through the city's vehicular racket, the ceaseless pointless HONKING and the yelling and the regular car sounds. They must scream louder than everything else screams in order to make themselves heard, but the choking noise pollution also takes its toll, creating stress, disrupting sleep—and relatedly, productivity and focus—and simply making us want to crawl out of our skin, in addition to more concrete effects like cardiovascular disease and hearing loss. 
And then we find ourselves trapped in a vicious siren cycle, where the natural earmuff of damaged aural systems means we need to crank up the volume. According to the Journal, that's already the case for ambulance drivers operating inside sound-proofed cars and/or ear buds to drown out the squall, so a logical solution would seem to be the wholesale replacement of our current sounds with something more symphonic. 
In fact, some NYC ambulances have already adopted this continental drawl. But according to the Journal, some people ""really like"" the so-called Rumbler siren, which can be felt as a vibration. Then again, some people really ""hate it."" Here's a little audio sample of what I will call siren classic, for your consideration:
Siren classic has obvious benefits: you need this cacophonous kick in the pants to alert you to looming dangers; to Morse code WATCH OUT straight against your eardrum, so that you don't wind up under the wheel of an emergency response vehicle. 
The so-called ""yelp"" siren, heard here, also accomplishes that task pretty handily:
Just to really experience all that a siren can do, because we're here listening to siren sounds and why the hell not, check out this Lenox Hill ambulance siren. It's very obnoxious, very obtrusive, and characterized by a sort of lasered honking that really grinds your earbones to dust:
Hear also: this frenetically blippy one, which sounds either like the video game version of itself or a bad DJ, you decide (but make sure you start at 0:09)!
All compelling audio attacks, to be sure, but it's eminently possible that you would internalize the message without the wall of obliterating noise; that the gentle drone of a more melodic siren might nudge you out of harm's way just as effectively, but without so much annoyance.
So: what do you think of this fancy boy siren, it's European!
If you heard that barreling down the street, would you understand the MOVE IT command, or would you get hit? I myself am partial to the two-tone, but I'll leave you to form your own opinions.",Strange noises drag all New Yorkers from peaceful slumber at some point: The cracking thud of what really sounds like a bowling ball dropped on your upstairs neighbors' tile floor at 3 a.m.; feline scrapes; grumbling garbage trucks mauling long rows of parked…,2019-02-14T16:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gothamist.com'}","Should NYC Switch To A Gentler, European-Style Siren?",http://gothamist.com/2019/02/14/euro_style_siren_very_nice.php,http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2019/02/sirensounds021419-thumb-640xauto-1027472.jpg,,Gothamist.com,rumbler,1

Kyle Rooney,"""Rowdy"" Ronda Rousey officially signed her WWE contract at last night's Elimination Chamber PPV, but it was a much more eventful occasion than simply putting pen to paper. Rousey, who made her WWE debut at the Royal Rumbler PPV last month, was joined in the ring by WWE chief executive Triple H, deputy commissioner Stephanie McMahon and Raw General Manager, Kurt Angle. RELATED : Jimmy Butler Undergoes Surgery, Timetable For Return Announced After listening to some praise from Triple H about the magnitude of this signing, Kurt Angle called out the WWE legend for talking shit behind Rousey's back. ""Didn't you say earlier, three years in the making and now we own the bitch,"" Angle said to Triple H. ""Didn't you say Ronda was a has-been?"" Naturally, the former UFC Bantamweight champion did what any other WWE superstar would hope to do in that situation. She put Triple H through a table much to the delight of the crowd at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bit didn't end there. Stephanie McMahon then smacked the WWE's newest employee, which reportedly left a handprint welt on her face. Last night's events lay the groundwork for Rousey's first WWE match which is expected to come at Wrestlemania 34 in April. It is believed that Rousey and a tag team partner (Possibly Kurt Angle or maybe even The Rock) will go up against Triple H and Stephanie McMahon.

VERENA DOBNIK,"NEW YORK (AP) If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city’s soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what’s heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
“I’ve been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance,” says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the city’s hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison.
Most Read Nation &amp; World Stories
“Europeanizing” New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention.
“The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing,” adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last week’s NBC “Saturday Night Live,” where a “Weekend Update” anchor joked that with the European-style siren, “You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.”
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city’s Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex.
At community board meetings, Mount Sinai’s Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.
“People hated them all,” Davis said, “but the ‘high-low’ was least intrusive. It didn’t have that piercing sound.”
Davis, a 40-year EMS veteran who suffers from hearing damage that he blames on repeated exposure to sirens, said the change was simple and cost effective: All it took was reprogramming the electronic box in each vehicle, which comes preloaded with seven different sounds with names such as “Wail,” ”Yelp” and “Piercer.”
In fact, many ambulances, fire trucks and police cars are equipped with alternate sirens and horns that they can employ in certain situations, such as in traffic when cars and pedestrians just won’t get out of the way. They include short blips and the “Rumbler” low-frequency, vibrating siren aimed at motorists who may otherwise be unable to hear higher frequencies.
For some Manhattanites, any change in the city’s daily siren song would be welcomed.
“I always have to cover my ears with my hands when a siren-blaring ambulance passes,” says Louise Belulovich, a Manhattan attorney. “If I’m carrying packages and unable to, then what is an annoying experience becomes a painful one.”
But Linda Sachs, a longtime resident of Manhattan’s Upper West Side who lives near one of the Mount Sinai hospitals that uses the new European siren, doesn’t think the change is for the good. She prefers the old New York standard.
“The old sirens never woke me up, but these make me shudder,” Sachs says, adding that she understands city lawmakers are attempting to do something about noise pollution. “But the old sound wasn’t as obnoxious.”","NEW YORK (AP) — If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city’s soundtrack for generations — WAAAAAhhhhhhh — would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to wh…",2019-02-26T06:04:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Seattletimes.com'}","Noise-weary New York ponders a gentler, European-style siren",https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/noise-weary-new-york-ponders-a-gentler-european-style-siren/,https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/urn-publicid-ap-org-dc5d16231f6a482b9cb9a9b41d47a8c6Sounds_of_Sirens_53603-1200x630.jpg,,Seattletimes.com,rumbler,1
,"Royal Enfield retails a host of its motorcycles in Australia and New Zealand, and has now introduced the Thunderbird 350 in the continent. Interestingly though, the Thunderbird 350 has been rebadged as the Royal Enfield Rumbler 350 in Australia. The bike is priced at 6790 Australian Dollars (around ₹ 3.41 lakh) on-road. The cruiser joins the likes of the Himalayan, Classic range and the Continental GT in the bike maker's line-up. The new Rumbler 350 is also LAMS (Learner Approved Motorcycle Scheme) compliant, which makes it accessible to young learners apart from those who want a relaxed, simple, old-school cruiser. The Royal Enfield Rumbler 350 for Australia is the identical to the Indian model barring a few subtle tweaks. The Australian spec model gets the new moniker on the side boxes, while the telescopic forks up front feature reflector strips on both sides. The fuel tank design and the laid back handlebars remain the same, while the engine is finished in black and adds to the good looks of the motorcycle. The Australian-spec bike is built and exported from the manufacturer's plant in Chennai. Royal Enfield Thunderbird 350 Australia The Royal Enfield Rumbler 350 also uses the same 346 cc twin-spark, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that also powers the Thunderbird 350 and a range of motorcycles in the company's stable. The motor is tuned to churn out 19.8 bhp at 5250 rpm, and 28 Nm of peak torque at 4000 rpm, while paired with a 5-speed gearbox. Other components also remain the same including the gas charged shock absorbers at the rear, 19-inch spoked wheel at the front an 18-inch unit at the rear. The fuel tank offers a capacity of 20 litres, while the headlamp cluster includes the projector lens with the LED DRL halo ring. The cruiser uses disc brakes at either end, but ABS has been given a miss like the Indian version. The Royal Enfield Rumbler 350 tips the scales at 192 kg (kerb). (The Royal Enfield Thunderbird X Series is not available in Australia yet) The Rumbler 350 is available in three colour options - black, dark green and blue. The Australian market does not get the Thunderbird X Series though that was recently launched in India. The Royal Enfield Thunderbird 350 and 500 X gets vibrant new colours, new gunslinger seat, alloy wheels and a host of modern-day upgrades.

Shawn Reynaldo,"Drumnbass and jungle were supposed to be dead. At least thats what the dance music cognoscenti told us for the better part of the past 15 years.
Of course, this music never truly disappeared , and when it comes to electronic music, dead is often a relative term. In reality, its usually just a matter of time before the spotlight comes swinging back around. After all, now that trancea genre that was once all but radioactive for most artists not named Tiëstohas come back into fashion, it's clear that all options are on the table.
Uprated Nite Zone is a hyperactive jungle rumbler with seemingly anonymous origins, although a bit of investigation appears to indicate that its actually the work of Scottish duo Clouds, whove been making quality techno for the past decade. (Theyve also been exploring the joys of UK hardcore and, yes, trance as of late with their Headstrong label, which the pair run in tandem with London producer Randomer.)
Last year, Clouds released an ambitious LP on Electric Deluxe called Heavy the Eclipse, a concept album set in a drug- and violence-ravaged future in which their hometown of Glasgow has been acquired by a German-speaking conglomerate that has incorporated the city into a new civic entity known as Neurealm.
Although the Hamilton Scalpel 12"" has been released on a new imprint called Concrete Cabin, its billed as a covert transmission from the outskirts of Neurealm, an easter egg that recalls the mystery that characterized much of the early rave era. Nostalgic? Absolutely. But the music here is also raucous, full of energy, and, most importantly, fun. Furthermore, it sounds fresh, especially when its furiously shuddering percussion is held up against the rigid, identikit house and techno thats being turned out in bulk these days.
To be clear, the Hamilton Scalpel project isnt some sort of outlier. Artists like dBridge, Alix Perez, and Sully are all making excellent drumnbass tunes, while labels such as Western Lore, Cosmic Bridge, and Astrophonica are just a few of the reliable hubs for these sounds. This music is in a particularly fertile place right nowleave it to the pundits to debate whether jungle is back from the grave or if tastemakers have simply started paying attention again.","Nostalgia be damned, this music is vital right now",2019-04-08T15:11:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Pitchfork.com'}",Hamilton Scalpel: “Uprated Nite Zone”,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/hamilton-scalpel-uprated-nite-zone/,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cab626b30ab0f4a91b857a6/1:1/w_500/Hamilton-Scalpel.jpg,,Pitchfork.com,rumbler,1
Fluxflashor https://www.hearthpwn.com/members/Fluxflashor,"There were no lines at Rastakhan’s Rumble. The motley crowd jostled, shoved, and moshed their way into the arena: the competition to get a good seat was almost as ferocious as the battle that would take place on the Arena floor! Rikkar followed the flow of the crowd, his eyes open for an opportunity to get down to the Arena floor so he could meet some of his favorite competitors—and maybe score a spot on a team! The corridor ahead of Rikkar was packed with an unusually riotous mob; a gleefully flailing mass of trolls, dwarves, ogres, gnomes, orcs, tauren, and more, including the occasional human. The wall of rampaging Rumble fans was held in check by the Arena’s bouncers' forbidding stares. Despite the festive mood, no one in the crowd was willing to test the resolve of the heavily-armored security team. Rikkar threaded nimbly through the thrashing crowd, deftly dodging elbows, administering the occasional shove when necessary. As a few slightly flattened gnomes were peeled off the walls, Rikkar noticed more posters for his favorite teams (every team was his favorite). Despite being one of the more popular Rumble teams, the Frogs had a reputation for being weird— because they were. They were also unparalleled in their mastery of troll mysticism. Let them scoff: Rikkar knew that joining Krag’wa’s team would make his talent with elemental magic blow up. Speaking of “blowing up”, the Dragonhawks were the hottest team in the Rumble this year. Everyone was talking about how they were on fire. Literally. All the time. And everything around them. If you absolutely, positively have to torch every adversary in the Arena, accept no substitutes. Rikkar admired Malacrass’ showmanship. Despite his team’s reputation as hot-heads, they knew how to fire up the crowd before sending the fireballs flying. Everybody knew that Princess Talanji was a reluctant Rumbler, and everyone also knew that it didn’t matter: with her as Champion of the Zombies they were the team to beat. Rumor had it that King Rastakhan himself had made some kind of bargain with Bwonsamdi, and ever since his family (including Princess Talanji) was required to serve the Loa of the Dead. Rikkar would have joined the Zombies at the stop of a heart, deal or no deal—Bwonsamdi was one of the most powerful Loa around. Rikkar saw an opening, and finally managed to slip past the bouncers and into the Arena! He inhaled the lovely aromas of ozone, hot steel, sand, and the press of thousands of bodies. And what’s better in the muggy, sticky, sweltering jungle heat than... soup? The usual funnel cake vendors were absent. Instead, enterprising Tuskarr were competing with the trolls peddling magically frozen ice cream to sell steaming bowls of stew with unidentifiable chunks floating in it. It seemed that the Tuskarr Bros. had mistakenly shipped a huge surplus of soup to Stranglethorn instead of Northrend, but they were making the most of it. Of course, Rumble fans being Rumble fans, more soup was getting ON the crowd, than was ending up IN the crowd. Rikkar dodged hurled soup and flying frozen treats as he searched in vain for a place to sit, but everywhere he looked the stands were already packed with roaring Rumble fans. He finally spotted a lone empty seat, all the way up by the announcer’s tower. It was as far back from the action as you could get, but it was better than nothing, wasn’t it? Swallowing his disappointment, Rikkar trudged up the many (many) stone stairs and snatched the seat before someone else could. From this distance, floor of the arena looked like a gold coin with ants skittering on it. How was he going to get into the action from here? If he was gonna get his shot, Rikkar realized that he'd have to take drastic action...",Two new cards were revealed by Blizzard in a blog post.,2018-11-21T18:09:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hearthpwn.com'}",New Card Reveals - Rabble Bouncer & Soup Vendor,https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6184-new-card-reveals-rabble-bouncer-soup-vendor,https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/380/923/636784207899084147.png,,Hearthpwn.com,rumbler,1
Frank Karsten,"Dominaria celebrates Magic’s history while adding an entry to the power/toughness matrix. Accordingly, I wanted to pay homage to some of the weirdest power/toughness combinations ever printed on Magic cards. Let’s get to my choices! 10. Char-Rumbler Future Sight was wild, and negative power was only one of the many bizarre things it explored. Char-Rumbler’s negative power kept the double striker with firebreathing in check. Since it deals no combat damage while its power is -1 or 0, you have to spend 2 mana before it actually does something. But it does get pretty powerful once you have plenty of red mana. I hope that one day, someone will find success with Char-Rumbler in their sideboard to go under Ensnaring Bridge. Tech against Lantern Control can be found in the weirdest places. 9. Force of Savagery Yup, another Future Sight card. It looks unplayable at first glance, making you wonder what you are supposed to do with a 0-toughness creature. After all, it will just go to the graveyard immediately as a state-based action. But ultimately, it gets you thinking about ways to use it. To have Force of Savagery survive, you could use a card like Gaea’s Anthem. Alternatively, you could exploit its high power and definite death with Varolz, the Scar-Striped. Although neither approach has led to a competitive Modern deck, I love that cards like Force of Savagery exist. 8. Wall of Shards Magic has seen plenty of high-toughness Walls, and cards like Glacial Wall or Wall of Stone make sense from a flavor perspective. They are sturdy and hard to kill, but they don’t damage any creature that tries to assault them. Wall of Shards is unique in that it’s the only 7+ toughness Wall with non-zero power. I can only wonder how—maybe the creatures cut themselves on the shards? Either way, the card is made even more bizarre by its cumulative upkeep, which can be exploited with Tainted Remedy and Rain of Gore. It’s even an underused sideboard option against Death’s Shadow. But most of all, Wall of Shards’ size is odd. 7. Little Girl Silver-bordered sets always include lots of weird designs, and Unhinged was no different. As the set’s sole vanilla creature, Little Girl took advantage of the fact that the set used fractions. As Mark Rosewater wrote : “Once we decided to do fractions, it became clear that this card was a must.” If you wonder how the card even works: well, if you get hit by Little Girl when you’re at 20, you would take half a damage, falling down to nineteen-and-a-half. And with the half-white cost, you can tap a Plains to cast two Little Girls on turn 1. That may sound underwhelming, but she worked well with Fraction Jackson and City of Ass. 6. Autochthon Wurm There are multiple creatures with 13 toughness (including the peculiar Tree of Perdition and Tree of Redemption ) and two creatures with 15 toughness (namely Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Worldspine Wurm ). But there is only one creature in Magic’s history with 14 toughness: Autochthon Wurm. To make matters even weirder, Autochthon Wurm lacks the square stats that Darksteel Colossus, Kozilek, Butcher of Truth, and almost all other huge creatures have. Still, it can survive Shivan Meteor, and I can only imagine the R&amp;D discussions that pegged the Wurm at exactly 9 power and exactly 15 mana. Would it really have been overpowered at 10 power and 14 mana? 5. Spinal Parasite Even considering its built-in way of growing, Spinal Parasite’s negative power and toughness is just plain weird. R&amp;D’s Brian Schneider explained the design as follows: “We hadn’t done a -1/-1 before and with sunburst it just felt like it was the right time. We were looking for a way to make Spinal Parasite more unique, and Mike Elliott half-jokingly submitted ‘make it a -1/-1.’ The development team liked the idea, and thus, Spinal Parasite is a -1/-1. It could have been a 0/0 and more powerful… but sometimes being more powerful isn’t more interesting.” 4. Big Furry Monster Big Furry Monster, the most popular card in Unglued and the inspiration for the augment mechanic from Unstable, historically put an end to the years-long arms race between the 8/8 Force of Nature, the 9/9 Colossus of Sardia, the 10/10 Leviathan, the 11/11 Polar Kraken, and the 12/12 Phyrexian Dreadnought. B.F.M. is so big that it even extended over two cards. The next-biggest square-stats creature (not counting the Marit Lage token that Dark Depths creates) is Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, which is a puny 15/15 by comparison. That said, even after drawing two different cards and spending 15 black mana, B.F.M. is easily taken down by a Typhoid Rats and two Squirrel tokens. At least Emrakul required 15 flying Squirrels. 3. Infinity Elemental Infinite power? What does that even mean? Well, apparently, we should treat Infinity Elemental’s power as if it has no bound, which means that it can’t change with a pump spell and instantly slays any creature, planeswalker, or player it touches. That’s fair enough, but things get weird when you combine Infinity Elemental with other cards. For example, what if you block your opponent’s Broodhatch Nantuko with Infinity Elemental and then attack back with Nacatl War-Pride ? ( You still die.) And what if you used Swords to Plowshares to gain infinite life and then get hit with an opposing Infinity Elemental? ( You’d still be at infinite life.) Indeed, this card is infinitely weird. 2. Lord of Tresserhorn I’ll just let Mark Rosewater explain why Lord of Tresserhorn stands out: For those that might not know the expression, a way to say goodbye in CB slang (CBs were a type of radio used by truckers back in the 70s) was “10-4, good buddy.” “10-4” was a way to say “okay” that you heard the other speaker. “Good buddy,” at the time, was a term for a friend. The card was actually designed as a 9/4 but the development team (my first as a fresh young developer) changed it to 10/4 because we specifically thought it would be funny to refer to him as Good Buddy. That’s how we got Magic’s only 10/4. And it also explains why CB enthusiasts like to boost a certain Dominaria creature with Arbor Armament so much. 1. Yargle, Glutton of Urborg Yargle is memorable for its name, its flavor text, its creature type, and its stats: the first 9/3 in Magic. The Yargle madness even hit the Limited Resources community review since the joke “A+” grades drove Yargle to the top of the most controversial list. According to Mark Rosewater, the story of Yargle’s design takes us back to 2004: “During one Champions of Kamigawa development meeting […], someone said it was impossible to design a legendary vanilla creature. I said it wasn’t and designed Isamaru, Hound of Konda on the spot to prove them wrong. Dominaria was another set with a legendary theme, so the question of a legendary vanilla creature came up again. The solution this time was to come up with a unique power/toughness combination that […] had never before been done in Magic. They ended up with a 9/3.” I can only guess what the next novel power/toughness combination will be to see print. Maybe a 9/4? A 7/9? A 14/14? Let me know your prediction in the comment section below!","Frank Karsten We've seen more 2/2s and 5/5s than we can count, but every once and awhile R&D throws a real curveball. 15 May, 18",2018-05-16T03:59:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Channelfireball.com'}",The 10 Most Weirdly Sized Creatures in Magic History,https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-10-most-weirdly-sized-creatures-in-magic-history/,http://www.channelfireball.com/wp-content/themes/fireball/assets/img/cfbshares.png,,Channelfireball.com,rumbler,1

Subscribe to receive these posts as a weekly newsletter. The UK’s arts minister, Michael Ellis, placed a temporary export bar on “Lobster Telephone (White Aphrodisiac)” (1938), a collaboration between Salvador Dalí and the English poet Edward Jones. It is hoped that a buyer can be found to match the asking price of £853,047 (~$1.2 million) plus VAT (value added tax). A Bulgarian commission accused Julia Kristeva of working as a secret agent for the nation’s Communist-era security apparatus. The commission, which has yet to publish its findings in detail, claims that the renowned philosopher and psychoanalyst served under the codename “Sabina.” The Getty Conservation Institute announced that it is close to completing its almost decade-long conservation of Tutankhamen’s tomb. As part of the project, researchers carried out tests on “mysterious brown spots” present on the tomb’s walls, concluding that they had not grown since Howard Carter discovered and documented the site in 1922. The GCI plans to publish a book on the project. Nicholas Nixon retired as photography professor of the Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt) following allegations of inappropriate behavior. The New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects rescinded honors bestowed upon Richard Meier and Peter Marino following sexual harassment allegations. Peter Marino Architect criticized AIA’s policy, stating that it has “disputed the sole hostile work environment claim against the firm.” Hundreds of arts and culture workers signed a petition supporting the parole of Herman Bell, a former Black Panther Party member convicted of killing two police officers in 1971. Critics, including NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, police unions, and the editorial board of the New York Post, have objected to Bell’s parole. Michael Rakowitz ‘s “The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist” (2018) became the 12th work to be installed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. The sculpture is directly inspired by a Lamassu entryway sculpture destroyed by ISIS in 2015. The diaries of John Rothenstein, the director of the Tate Gallery between 1938 and 1964, appear to document Henry Moore’s scathing criticism of a Barbara Hepworth sculpture during a board discussion on possible acquisitions. A one-year restoration project of the Church of Santa Felicita’s Capponi Chapel was completed. Designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, the chapel includes a cycle of works created by Jacopo Pontormo. The project was funded by the non-profit organization Friends of Florence. Pontormo’s “Deposition from the Cross” (1528) post restoration (courtesy Friends of Florence) President Trump signed the “ Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act ” (aka “EGO Act”) into law, thereby prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for official portraits of government officers or employees. Constantin Brancusi’s “Le Baiser” (The Kiss) (1909) was obscured by a wooden box at the Cimetière du Montparnasse. The sculpture adorns the grave of Tatiana Rachewskaïa, whose family purportedly made the decision to cover the work. Art historians Charles Beddington and John Gash attributed a painting donated to the University of Aberdeen over 150 years ago as a work by Canaletto (1697–1768). The Tokyo National Museum’s show, Unkei: The Great Master of Buddhist Sculpture, was the most popular museum exhibition of 2017 according to an analysis by The Art Newspaper. Scientists working at the Nicholson Museum discovered mummified remains in a sarcophagus acquired by the University of Sydney 150 years ago.

Boxing News,"Returning rumbler Gary Corcoran insists that 2018 is the year that he’ll finally confirm himself ‘top dog’ in Britain’s fast evolving welterweight division. In a 19 fight paid career, the bull strong brawler from an Irish traveller’s site near Paddington has only conceded twice – when conceding natural weight to world class super-welter Liam Williams, and in a gallant WBO challenge to Jeff Horn when 12,000 miles from home. (Both stopped him whilst still vertical and retaliating in round 11). ‘Before the end of the year, I want to wrap up the British and then take whatever comes my way,’ states the appropriated named ‘Hellraiser’ who starts his 2018 campaign in an eight rounder on the bonanza Belfast bill this weekend. ‘For a chance to win the British welterweight title, I’d fight Brad Skeete, Johnny Garton and Frankie Gavin on the same night! ‘Brad and me has been on-off for years and, if it doesn’t happen this year, it’ll probably never happen. I’ve got far more about me than Skeete has. He’s just a pure boxer and he can’t run from me. I’m too strong. I’ll cut him down and bash him up. Gavin, the same. I love bullying those types. ‘Me and Johnny Garton for the vacant title is a fight the fans would love to see, two tough London boys. I’d not take him lightly but I’ve fought at a far higher level and I’d be giving him a beating. Like that Josh Kelly (the 2016 GB Olympian), he’s never beaten anyone of note. ‘And I’d have no qualms about fighting the Spanish kid (Kerman Lajarraga) who bashed up Skeete for the European title. He only chose Frankie Gavin next cos he knows it’s an easy defence.’ While Corcoran’s valour was commonly lauded during his December WBO title challenge on the other side of the globe, the Wembley-born warlord claims he underperformed! ‘I really want to impress this year because I’m a lot better than I showed against Horn,’ insists Gary, one of 12 offspring. ‘It was a big opportunity for me. I was in Australia for over a month and it was the hardest I ever trained. But I was badly cut in sparring 10 days before the fight and we just about managed to clean it up. I knew it would re-open and Horn landed a couple of head butts in the early rounds. He’s that kind of fighter. ‘After that it was so painful. I was well in the fight until half way but I couldn’t pick it up when I needed. The indoor arena was packed and, if I’m honest, I froze on the massive stage. Nothing went my way. ‘Horn was a good champion. Losing the title to Terence Crawford – the best in the world pound for pound, in my view – was no disgrace but I should’ve done a lot better. I couldn’t bring to the ring the things I was doing in the gym. But it’s all a learning curve.’ Dormant since, fearless Corcoran initially agreed to confront local dangerman Paddy Gallagher for his return on Saturday, only for the 2010 Commonwealth Games champion to bow out with a broken jaw. ‘I was really disappointed because I’d trained hard to give that boy a beating. I’d have snapped his jaw in the fight, but someone beat me to it,’ says Corcoran who is coached by Peter Stanley and Frank Greaves at The Peacock gym in Canning Town, east London. ‘He’d not fought anywhere near the level of opponent I have yet he’s lost four times, including to an old man (35 year old Yank Brad Solomon) in his last fight. And the cheeky **** says he’s going to knock me out? Laughable! ‘I’ve been trying to keep away from social media but I’ll still give him his chance down the line, if he’s got the balls to step in. That’d be quite an easy bashing, I’d give him. ‘But the missus’ family are from Belfast so it’s always nice to visit and fight here. When I fought there before in my comeback fight at The Waterfront (wrsf5 James Gorman, March 2017), the Irish were very good to me. Belfast fans always generate a great atmosphere. ‘I believe I’m now in an eight rounder (opponent TBA) and I intend to listen to orders and look good, show what I’ve been improving on in camp, sparring top class boys like Kell Brook, Sam Eggington David Avenesyan and Asinia Byfield. ‘I’m more sideways on now, everything off the jab, using angles. That said, the ‘Hellraiser’ will always be there – you can’t coach that – and if I have to charge forward like a train I will do. ‘But I want to wake up on Sunday morning with no pain to my eyes, my head or my hands. This time, I intend to win as clean as possible.’","Returning rumbler Gary Corcoran insists that 2018 is the year that he’ll finally confirm himself ‘top dog’ in Britain’s fast evolving welterweight division.

Lit Hub Excerpts,"BUOYANCY What you have that makes you float. Does what the word sounds like it does with its B and its U bobbing up. Memories have buoyancy. They bob up to the surface like corks. My parents and I lived in a bus until my mom went away and my dad and I moved out of the bus for some reason. That’s when we moved in with my uncle. I say we, but mostly it was me. My dad moved in, and then he moved out. You can put all your clothes and your toothbrush in a bag but not be moving anywhere—you can just be going. Whether it’s moving is up to you. If two grown men get in a fight, it’s not a fight like at school. They will yell and knock things over and it will all happen really quickly. It will come out of nowhere and they’ll say they’re sorry afterward. But if one of the men puts his clothes and his toothbrush in a bag and says he’s going on a trip, you can be sure that what he’s actually doing is moving away, but you’ll only realize it later (see AFTER THE FACT). I remember my uncle floating in the pond on an inner tube, spinning slowly on the water, playing the bugle for me. His eyebrows and moustache were wet and dripping, and he was squinting, bugling, making his eyebrows dance, hoping I would laugh. I remember being drawn to the water but afraid of it, and being afraid of my uncle. I remember running up the dock to where my dad was lying in the grass and I remember him taking me and hugging me, then getting up and walking away. Until another memory comes bobbing up, that’s the last of him I have—that’s the day he disappeared for good and left me with my uncle. What’s most buoyant about that memory is the feeling of my dad’s shirt. It was warm and soft, but crisp in its wrinkles where my face was pressed to it. What I don’t remember is the color of the shirt, where he was going, why I didn’t go with him, or what he said to me when he left. Judging by the buoyancy of memory, the sensation of his shirt was more important. Article continues after advertisement BEEF IN BED While nothing really helps the physical pain of eighteen beestings, an ice pack and a hamburger will make you feel better about the fact that you got stung. Bees don’t sting cows, is what you could tell yourself is the reason, because cows have no business in the woods that would cause them to go stomping on rotten logs beneath sycamore trees. The real reason why beef helps beestings is that it feels good to have your uncle bring you a burger in bed for the first time in all the years you’ve lived with him. Seeing him come in with a plate for you will cancel out the pain. BEFITTING When something makes sense given the circumstances. If you get stung by a bunch of bees, do this: show your uncle the welts, lie down on your bed, and wait for him to bring you an ice pack and a hamburger. Put the ice on your head and slowly eat the burger. Concentrate on the taste of the food and the cold of the ice on your head, and then share some burger with your Betta Fish. Break the beef up into little bits so he can fit them in his mouth. If he’s a good fighter, he will suck the beef into his mouth, swim in a circle, spit the beef out, and repeat. It is befitting if, for example, you are sitting on your bed, stung-up by bees and eating a burger, watching your Betta Fish eat his, and your uncle comes in to see how you’re feeling, looks at what’s happening in the tank, and says, “Fighting fish is beefing up, I see.” After your uncle leaves you hop off the bed and grab Alberta’s dictionary and look up BEEFING UP and find it buried in the entry titled BEEF and then right there below BEEF you see the word BEFITTING—there’s a moment you could call befitting.

His eyebrows and moustache were wet and dripping, and he was squinting, bugling, making his eyebrows dance, hoping I would laugh.” BOOMS Thunder, The Rolling Rumbler, is a sound associated with shivering leaves, rippling bodies of water, fast-moving gray clouds, starlessness, lightning, and the galloping of horses from open prairies to the shelter of trees. Birds love to wing madly in thunder-filled springtime air, disappearing just an instant before the deluge of rain that most often runs with the Rumbler. The Rumbler loves nothing more than to show up for Easter Sunday. Men, women, children, and horses have all been vaporized by lightning while in the act of eating jelly beans in fields on Easter. BLACK ASH When an object is struck by lightning, a nuclear shock wave, or a sound of tremendous magnitude, that object will become vaporized. There are three types of vaporization: Partial, Total, and Subliminal. Partially vaporized objects become piles of black, reflective ash. Totally vaporized objects become puffs of smoke, and merge with the wind so quickly that no one has ever seen it actually happen. If you’re a baby and your parents set you down for a minute to go hide jelly beans in a field on Easter but then they get totally vaporized by lightning, you’ll have to go live with your uncle. BOMBED OUT or SUBLIMINAL VAPORIZATION If an object has been struck by lightning but has been neither partially nor totally vaporized, that is to say the object still appears to be the thing that it is, then the object has been subliminally vaporized. The inner energy of the object converts into a warm, invisible haze that rises into the atmosphere, never to return to its one-time host. A horse, for example, may be subliminally vaporized and still try to approach you when you hold out a carrot, though the way she looks at you will betray the fact that there’s nothing going on in there—you could knock on the door but nobody would be home. BABY NO LONGER A BABY At some point, a baby stops being a baby. One idea is that a baby is less a baby with each new word it utters, and that it finally stops being a baby when it realizes it can say what it wants to say without having to start crying. When a baby points at something and makes a sound, it thinks the sound it has made represents that thing. No matter if the baby points at a lawn mower and says RACE CAR or if he actually points to a car when he says it, nearby adults will encourage him by smiling at him and making baby sounds of their own or by tickling his little baby feet. A baby’s desire to make words gets stronger when people encourage him, but so does his desire to speak correctly, to give something the correct name, that is, whatever name gets the most adults smiling and nodding. I once knew a kid who still had a lot of his baby language. He called grass “skin” and rotting wood “slug” and I don’t remember much else but it was a really good language and I sometimes wonder if his language is still alive somewhere, but I don’t hold out much hope. BABY MEMORIES Everybody wishes they had more baby memories, because back then it was all a vacation and everything was a game and all you needed was air and milk and we’ve forgotten what that felt like. Sadly, baby memories don’t exist. One theory about babies says that the moment a baby realizes it has a memory is the moment it becomes a child. If you can take something you’re experiencing and know that you’re going to remember it later, then you are not a baby anymore. What you remember as your earliest memory is the end of you as a baby. A memory that feels like your earliest can come to you out of the blue (see KERNELS OF THE PAST), and so your childhood can expand or contract. My earliest memory came to me out of the blue one day while I was playing a game with my uncle in the basement of his mansion, where I lived at the time, and when I had it I instantly became older. BREEZE, BLUSTERY Wind is the world’s greatest traveler. Wind moves the fastest of all things, and it makes the greatest journeys, traveling as far as the sun and back. Wind spends a lot of time running ahead of big thunderstorms, bouncing around in the graying sunlight, shivering tree leaves, conscripting anything light and airy as it races across the earth. A breeze is a gust of wind, and days that are breezy are called blustery. Everything is influenced by the weather. It’s more common to meet strangers on blustery days than it is to meet them on calm ones. People get blown in like leaves fallen from faraway trees. On blustery days, light objects being blown across the ground are said to be skittering. Fly balls sail in curves. Ned was chasing a pop fly when a gust of wind curved its path and brought it out to me where I stood past the fence. He asked me for it and I threw it to him, but I took a while to throw it because I liked the feel of the ball in my hand. Then everyone was yelling at Ned to throw it in. They blamed Ned for what was done by the wind. I told Ned his team was better off without him and said I needed help building a treehouse. “I once knew a kid who still had a lot of his baby language. He called grass “skin” and rotting wood “slug” and I don’t remember much else but it was a really good language and I sometimes wonder if his language is still alive somewhere, but I don’t hold out much hope.” BRIGHTNESS OF SUNLIGHT Anytime you’re awake and outside in the daytime, no matter what it is you’re looking at, you’re seeing sunlight bouncing off the thing that you’re seeing. If you look at your hand and see skin, that’s actually sunlight reflecting off of what you have come to know as your skin. When a storm cloud rolls through and it’s daytime, let’s say it’s Easter because storms happen a lot around then, if a thundercloud covers up all the sky you can see, everything turns a little bit gray. Even bright colors get some gray in them. So let’s say, for example, a child discovers a jelly bean beneath a wet log rotting in the pasture behind his uncle’s mansion. He hears thunder. He sees the horses watching him from the cover of a stand of cedars, and he hears someone calling to him to come inside but he doesn’t go because he’s seen this jelly bean, which could be red but is also gray, and he wonders what to name the color. Unless he realizes that everything around him is a reflection of sunlight, which in this moment is gray because a storm has rolled in, he will be vaporized by lightning. It would be stupid to die while wondering about the color of a jelly bean. A final thing about brightness and its use in the nighttime: my uncle once told me that things are the same whether or not there’s light shining on them. He taught me about how if you’re alone in your room and it’s dark out and you start to see things grow and transform in the darkness of your room, just picture the way your room looks when sunlight is shining in through the window. You won’t be scared anymore, and the next thing you know it’ll be morning. BUGLING There are many different brass instruments known to man, one of which is the bugle. Before you start bugling, make sure that what you have is actually a bugle. Bugles can be recognized by their brass curves and lack of buttons. It is important that your bugle have a mouthpiece. That’s the cone-shaped silver thing you blow the air into. Next you need to practice blowing correctly. Put your lips together and make a fart-like buzzing noise by pushing air through your tightly closed lips. The buzzing noise should not be made with air you have stored in the pocket of your mouth but rather with air from your lungs. Put your lips to the bugle and buzz into it. The buzzing sound is what creates bugle music. The bugle can be used to create a huge variety of sounds, and there are many different songs you can play once you get to be a good bugler. Even if you can’t play any songs, you can still use the bugle to get the attention of someone in the distance. BUGLING UNCLE Look out across the shiny new mansions at the edge of town, at the nearly identical mansions built on huge lawns that butt up against the old forest, and imagine the kinds of people who live in these buildings. Odds are that one of them is somebody’s uncle. My uncle made his fortune playing the bugle at nursing homes and then wisely investing his earnings in the stock market. “Remember this,” he said one day when a teacher from my school called to talk to him on the phone about me, “remember this when people come up and tell you that something you’re doing will never get you anywhere. Remember about the time when your uncle got a five-dollar bill as a tip at a bugle gig, and how he decided on a whim to take it down to some hobos who hung out by the railroad tracks. He loved money, and he needed it, but for some reason on that one day he just knew he had to take the money down to the guys at the railroad tracks. Remember how one of those hobos turned out to be in real estate.” I’ve never forgotten the story. He slammed the phone on its receiver, got down on one knee, and squeezed my hand tightly while he told it to me. I didn’t know what Real Estate meant, but I knew that it was good. My uncle said he was mostly retired by the time I moved in with him but he still blew the bugle once in a while and he’d never stopped thinking about money. I loved to run full-tilt through the long, carpeted halls of his mansion and down the stairs to the maze-like concrete basement. I’d run barefoot in the hot summer across the cool basement floor to the chest freezer stocked with plastic tubes of sweet, colored ice. My uncle never cared how many I had until one day when I melted some of the ice tubes and used the colored liquid for art, and then he stopped buying them. BUS, STOPPED If you’re traveling through the countryside and you look off the road, you’ll see a lot of stopped buses. If you look carefully, sometimes you’ll see people living in these buses. People live in buses the same way some kids live in treehouses and some gypsies live in parachutes (see GYPSY PARACHUTE HOUSE). I have a photograph I found on an archaeological expedition that proves I once lived in a stopped bus. The bus in the picture was once a school bus. Then my parents got it, drove it to the top of a hill, and shut off the engine for good. There’s a table outside the folding door of the bus. There are plastic chairs around the table and an umbrella in the middle. Flowerpots hang from the bus’s windows and there are two chaise lounges on the roof for watching the stars. My parents planted a garden right next to the bus and sat at the table in the shade of the umbrella after they worked in the garden. You see it all in the picture. Inside the bus, where you can’t see, where there used to be seats for schoolchildren, there was a bed, a radio, and a bookcase. You can’t see inside the bus in the picture but I remember what it was like because I’ve been in there myself. The baby in the photo is me. I’m on a blanket spread out in the garden and I’m tiny. My mother is there next to me, and my father is taking the picture. I know this because he wrote on the back of it, and because he printed the photo on the enlarger that my uncle kept hidden away in the basement. BOREDOM If it’s pouring rain out and you’re trapped inside for whole afternoons at a time, you’ll have to come up with some way of entertaining yourself indoors, otherwise you will suffer from boredom. If you’re used to being outside every afternoon—let’s say you’ve gotten into a routine of exploring the woods around your treehouse, hacking paths through thickets and constructing elaborate booby traps for unwanted visitors, and let’s say that you have a particularly elaborate booby trap in the works, a trap that is nearly complete and that must be completed soon because a gang of bullies has discovered the secret location of your tree fort—but it’s pouring rain outside and so travel to the fort, much less construction of the booby trap, is not feasible, you will find yourself staring out the window at the dark clouds behind the tree line, dark and only getting darker, and you’ll make bets on which drops of rain will be the first to make it down to the bottom of the windowpane: that’s boredom. If you’re lucky, you’ll have a Betta Fish. A Betta Fish can be counted on to provide a solid hour or so of entertainment when presented with a photograph of another Betta Fish through the glass of its tank. There are only so many times a Betta Fish can attack the picture through the glass, though. If you give the fish the picture too often, you can hurt it. Boredom is not just dangerous for Betta Fish. Boredom is also dangerous for your relationship with your uncle. You get a lot of ideas when you’re bored so it’s important to tell the difference between a good idea and a bad idea. It’s a bad idea, for instance, to melt ice pops on old photographic equipment. It’s a good idea, on the other hand, to read a book. If you get bored of reading, you can write your own story or draw your own picture. But even that can get boring. I remember one particularly rainy spring when my uncle was always gone and I had whole days to myself. At the time, I was working on the best treehouse I’d ever built. The sycamore it was in was ancient and had perfect structure. The fort was surrounded by booby traps and had two little windows you could shoot rocks out of. Six kids once tried to take us over. They made it through the first line of booby traps and it was just me and Ned up there, but we were ready. Two versus six and we won. Ned sustained a stone to the eye thrown by a long-armed boy named Tony who, it turned out, was the top pitcher in Little League, but Ned didn’t bleed for long and we were able to do far worse to the attackers. See—it’s hard to write about boredom without getting distracted by telling something interesting. It was a high-caliber treehouse I had the year it was so rainy the pond tripled in size and sucked in one of the mansions being built on the other side of the pond, the year my uncle was always away at the tracks and I had so much time by myself that my imagination was too weak to defend me from boredom. My uncle was gone most of the time, and when he was home he was depressed because the bets weren’t going his way. He would just watch the rain in silence and ignore me, and that’s about the only time I ever wished I’d had another uncle or my original parents (see also NEGLECT). I tried, in desperation, to make it to the treehouse, which I knew must have been rotting in the torrential rain, but I ended up almost getting swept away by a stream that was deeper than I thought it was. __________________________________ From A Key To Treehouse Living.

"April Reese, April Reese","W ildfires burning around the West. Rising seas lapping at the East. Animal feces, coal ash, and fertilizer fouling waterways from the Carolinas to the Midwest. Bridges, roads, and pipelines crumbling across the country. With the midterm elections less than a month away, communities across the United States face some of the most formidable scientific, environmental, and technological challenges in decades. On November 6, voters from Alaska to Florida will choose not just their next governor, state representative, or member of Congress, but to some degree how we live for decades to come. This is the most important election of our lifetime, says Bill Holland, New Mexico policy director for the League of Conservation Voters. In the 36 gubernatorial and 470 congressional races around the country, some of these challenges, like opioids and fossil fuels, are campaign issues, while others, such as climate changes role in severe wildfires, dont appear on any candidates platform. But, whether these matters are on their minds, the victors will face them once sworn in. Their decisions will help shape how well storm-ravaged communities adapt, whether the water is safe to drink, how open our internet will be, and more. These are the top science, technology, or environment issues facing each stateplus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. Even if it never surfaces on the campaign trail, science is always on the ballot. Scroll through, or use the links below to jump to your state: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming Alabama: Keeping drinking water drinkable With more than 100 mines, the Black Warrior River watershed is one of the largest coal-producing regions in the South. It also provides drinking water for Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, and other Alabama cities. While the mines employ hundreds of people, runoff from the operations carries heavy metals, acids, and sediment into waterways. Strip miningin which workers scrape the surface of a mine and dump waste rock into valleys that run into river valleysis one of the worst culprits. Environmental groups, including the Black Warrior Riverkeeper, say the Alabama Department of Environmental Management has failed to enforce laws that would protect water quality in the region. Theyve filed several lawsuits to compel the department to address the issue. Alaska: Guarding calving grounds The 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is home to North Americas largest caribou herd. It also encompasses what energy companies believe is the biggest untapped oil and gas reserve left in the U.S. Companies have angled to drill in the refuges coastal plain for almost four decades, but congressional attempts to open the lands failed amid concerns that it would damage the caribous calving areas. Now, the industry might get its wish. Last year, Congress authorized drilling in the area as part of a tax reform bill, and directed the Bureau of Land Management to offer oil and gas leases to energy companies by 2024. BLM has received a proposal for seismic exploration of the 1.6-million-acre plain this coming winter. Longtime drilling proponent Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and other supporters say development would be limited to no more than 2,000 acres. But a U.S. Geological Survey study of the effects of such development on caribou found that the animals avoided calving in any areas with concentrations of drilling infrastructure, which could cause the mammals numbers to dwindle. Similar studies also found that the herd avoids areas near oil and gas fields in the Canadian side of its range. Arizona: Water conservation For decades, two massive reservoirsLake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border and Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah borderhave stored water from the Colorado River for cities and farms in Western states, including California, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as Mexico. But a triple whammy of prolonged drought, this past winters paltry Rocky Mountain snowpack (which feeds the rivers lower basin), and years of overuse by cities, farms, and factories have left levels low enough to risk a water shortagethe first ever within the next two years. By the end of this year, Lake Mead will be at 1,080 feet above sea level, just 5 feet above the threshold that triggers the declaration of a shortage. If that happens, under agreements among the states that share the basins water, Arizona and Nevada, who have the most junior rights in the basin, would face the biggest cuts. Grand Canyon State water managers recently began drafting a drought contingency plan to soften the blow through conservation and other measures. The team hopes the legislature will approve the plan when it reconvenes in January. Arkansas: Monitoring confined animal feeding operations The animal waste and dirtied water flowing out of high-density hog farms, a type of confined animal feeding operation (CAFO), have troubled clean-water advocates for years. The fate of Arkansas largestC&amp;H Hog Farms, a 6,500-head facility in the Buffalo River watershedcould determine the collective destiny of all other CAFOs in Arkansas. In operation since 2012, the facility has been hotly contested by some residents and local environmental organizations, including the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance and the Ozark Society. The groups worry that the estimated 2.5 million gallons of annual waste will leak into waterways and cause harmful algae blooms (rapidly growing colonies that produce toxins) downstream. The state Department of Environmental Quality suspended permitting of other CAFOs in the area, and, earlier this year, continued its crackdown by denying the facilitys renewed operating permit. C&amp;H has appealed the decision. California: Forging paths forward To some degree, California and its nearly 40 million residents face almost every issue in the country. Where the Golden State sets itself apart, though, is in how its solutions to those issues can often set a national standard. Climate change is at the root of its most pressing issuesa five-year drought, more-frequent wildfires, and water scarcity but the states long-running push to expand renewable energy is facing challenges. Gov. Jerry Brown and some state lawmakers worry that President Trumps embrace of fossil fuels will interfere with states 12-year-old effort to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and its new plan to go carbon-free by 2045. Thanks to a range of measurescapping industrial emissions, setting high vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, and providing incentives to switch to solarthe initial plan has met its goal of slashing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels four years ahead of schedule. (Thats more ambitious than targets in other states, which aim to cut emissions to higher 2000 levels.) In August, however, the Trump administration proposed revoking Californias authority to impose its own automotive standards. These and other federal climate-change rollbacks might be enough to sway voters, according to some analysts. The state is also a bellwether in the national debate about internet freedom. Home to the nations leading tech companies, California is working to fill the regulatory vacuum left by the June federal repeal of Federal Communications Commission net neutrality regulations. This past August, state lawmakers passed a bill that will bar internet-service providers from slowing or blocking websites, and restrict zero-metering, the practice of not counting preferred services and apps against a customers monthly data limits. But days after Gov. Brown signed the bill into law in September, the Justice Department filed a legal challenge against it, arguing that internet runs between states, and is therefore subject to federal oversight. Colorado: Quelling wildfire The Spring Creek Fire scorched 108,000 acres of southern Colorado in July, making it the third-biggest blaze in the states historyand this past summer was its worst fire season in more than a decade. While August monsoons diminished the risk, the burns effect on vegetation led to another problem: floods. Without roots to hold the soil, sheets of water overflowed waterways and washed out roads. In the coming years, a Centennial State collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder could help officials and land managers prepare for the next big burn. The prediction system will combine weather data, vegetation type, topography, and fire-behavior models to determine where a blaze will spread, how severe it will become, and how it will behave. The project, which is in the testing stage, has bipartisan support in the statehouse. Connecticut: Bad air days During a heatwave this past August, health officials issued a warning that has become very familiar to residents of the Nutmeg State: Elderly folks and people with asthma should stay indoors until smog levels subside. Air pollution remains a problem throughout the Northeast, but Connecticut has it worst: For two out of the past three years, the state has had 30 bad air dayswhen levels of ground-level ozone, a component of smog produced by vehicles and other sources, reached levels that could lead to asthma attacks and breathing problems. Neighboring Massachusetts, the state with the next-worst quality in the region, experienced about 3. The daily crush of commuters on I-95 is part of the problem; transportation accounts for 36 percent of emissions, according to the states 2013 greenhouse gas inventory (its most recent). Connecticut is also a victim of geography: It sits below an air-current highway that streams pollution from coal-fired power plants in Midwestern states. The state is one of 19 (including the District of Columbia) challenging the Trump administrations decision to freeze fuel-economy standards for cars and sport utility vehicles at 2020 levels. Gubernatorial candidate Ned Lamont is among those making noise about the decision and has also vowed to put more electric vehicles on the road; challenger Bob Stefanowski has not taken a position on the issue. Delaware: Blocking offshore drilling Tiny Delaware is mostly coastal, and its economy relies heavily on beach tourism. In 2016, nine million visitors generated $500 million in tax revenue. So when President Trump announced plans to open most of the nations coastline to offshore energy development, state officialsworried about tourism-killing oil spills and unsightly derricksswiftly moved to fill the regulatory vacuum. This past June, lawmakers passed a bill that bans offshore oil and gas drilling in the state. Gov. John Carney, who has spoken out against Trumps plan, signed the measure September 20. While state waters extend only 3.5 miles offshore, companies wanting to develop in the zone would still have to get state permission to build pipelines and other infrastructure. The bill grants local regulators the authority to deny such permits. Companion legislation also empowers the state to take legal action to challenge oil and gas leases in federal waters. Florida: Coastal protection With 8,436 miles of coastline, more of Florida is at risk from sea-level rise than any other continental U.S. state. A recent University of Florida study found that levels rose more than 0.79 inches per year between 2011 and 2015 along the Sunshine States east coast. A May report by the Union of Concerned Scientists predicted that, in a worst-case scenario, three Florida communities, including two in the Keys, could experience double the current rate of tidal flooding by 2030; by 2045, 15 more communities, including Miami Beach, could see increased inundations; and 14 more, including Cocoa Beach-Cape Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale, and Jacksonville Beaches, would be regularly swamped by 2060. Despite this and other analyses, local lawmakers and Gov. Rick Scott have resisted statewide efforts to prepare for a waterlogged future. Some coastal communities are beginning to adopt their own measures to deal with the rising waters; Miami Beach, for example, has redesigned stormwater-drainage systems and plans to raise roads by 2 feet although some residents have fought those efforts, saying elevating streets could hurt property values. Georgia: Conserving marshland Georgia harbors one-third of the East Coasts remaining salt marshlands, which filter pollutants, buffer against storm surges, and provide habitats for birds, shrimp, crabs, and other wildlife. But the Peach States marshes are in trouble. A recent University of Georgia analysis found a 35 percent drop in vegetation along the coast over the past 30 years. A spike in temperatures and prolonged drought are largely to blameas is encroaching development. As building continues, legislative pushback has been sparse: A bill, introduced by state Rep. Matt Dubnik, would create a specialty license plate to generate funds to support wetlands conservation and restoration. Related: These scientists may be your next members of Congress Hawaii: Reconciling wildlife protection and green-energy development The Aloha State and California share the most ambitious green-energy target in the nation: One-hundred percent of the archipelagos electricity must come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2045. But the proliferation of wind turbines has come with an unexpected cost. The structures are killing large numbers of endangered Hawaiian hoary bats, the states only native land mammal. Under a special provision of the Endangered Species Act, a trio of Hawaiian wind farms secured a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to cover the accidental take of 92 bats over 25 years, but theyve reached that limit in just six. Earlier this year, wind generators asked the agency to raise the limit to 483 bats. To receive the expanded permit, the companies will have to show what measures theyll take to minimize harm to the batssuch as shutting off turbines when winds are mild to avoid collisions, and using ultrasonic sound to shoo the critters from the blades. Idaho: Sharing the forests For decades, Western states have sought greater say in how the government manages federal land within their borders. The fracas has often ended up in court, but Idaho Gov. Butch Otter and other officials have come up with a compromise that could help ease those tensionsat least relating to the states 20 million acres of federal forests. Under the new good neighbor plan, foresters will work alongside U.S. Forest Service officials on federal projects, such as thinning overcrowded areas to reduce wildfire risk. Weve made a lot of progress on the politics of forest management, says John Freemuth, a professor of public policy at Boise State University. Policymakers and public land advocates around the West are keeping an eye on how the new collaboration plays out. Illinois: Cleaning up the Great Lakes Fifty years ago, the Great Lakesthe worlds largest source of freshwaterwere widely polluted. But after a decades-long federal cleanup effort, the lakes have begun to rebound. The upward trend might be in jeopardy, though. A June executive order, which revoked a 2010 order by President Barack Obama to protect and restore Great Lakes ecosystems, could open the door to oil and gas developmentand the potential for spills that could foul drinking water and harm aquatic life. Congressional candidate Sean Casten, a biochemical engineer and clean-energy entrepreneur, has made Great Lakes protections a campaign issue, accusing incumbent Rep. Peter Roskam of not doing enough. Though it should be mentioned that Roskam has fought a separate Trump effort to defund the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, aimed at protecting water quality and ecosystem health. Indiana: Containing coal ash The Hoosier State has more coal-ash disposal ponds than any other, and tests show groundwater near 15 power plants is contaminated with a cocktail of cobalt, lead, arsenic, boron, molybdenum, radium, and thallium. So when the EPA announced in July changes to coal-ash regulation s adopted by the Obama administration, the Hoosier Environmental Council and other advocates in Indiana warned that the move could leave more of the states water resources vulnerable to pollution. The new rule ditches the requirement that state officials force coal companies to monitor groundwater, and gives states more flexibility in determining how companies should handle ash dumps. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management has indicated it will now loosen requirements; though some companies, such as the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), have said they plan to continue monitoring groundwater and proceed with coal-ash pond closures. Iowa: Curbing farm pollution Phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from the Hawkeye States farms has worsened: Nitrogen alone increased 47 percent over the past five years, according to a recent University of Iowa study. This is in spite of a five-year-old plan to reduce nutrient pollution by 45 percent. And what happens in Iowa doesnt stay in Iowa. These nutrients flow into waterways that eventually pollute the Gulf of Mexico, where they feed the areas infamous dead zone. The overload feeds massive algae blooms that cause oxygen levels in the now 8,776-square-mile swath to drop so low that marine life cant survive, threatening the regions seafood industry. Kansas: Dry-cleaning chemicals in residents water This past summer, an investigation in the Wichita Eagle newspaper found that hundreds of residents drank and bathed in water fouled with the dry-cleaning chemical perchloroethylene (PCE) for more than six yearsand that state officials failed to inform the communities. At one site, PCE levels in the groundwater were 8.1 parts per billion; EPA limit is 5 ppb. As many as 22 other contaminated sites may have gone unaddressed, according to the investigation. A 1995 state law lobbied for by the dry-cleaning industry appears to be largely to blame. The Kansas Drycleaner Environmental Response Act included a provision that directed state regulators to refrain from looking for contamination from dry cleaners and make every reasonable effort to keep sites off the EPAs Superfund list. Residents are calling for the state to scrub up the areas and for lawmakers to strike the part of the legislation that bars checking for PCE leaks in groundwater. Kentucky: Fighting opioid abuse More than 1,500 people died from drug overdoses in the Bluegrass State in 2017, an 11 percent increase over 2016with heroin, fentanyl, or both involved in many of them. State lawmakers are taking a multipronged approach to tackling the problem: Theyve limited fills to three days (rather than the five- to seven-day bars in most states) to keep doctors from overprescribing the meds; state Attorney General Andy Beshear has sued seven pharmaceutical companies for failing to disclose how addictive their painkillers are; and a bipartisan bill to legalize medical cannabis, which for some could be used as an alternative pain medication, will likely be reintroduced in the 2019 legislature. Were still not taking this seriously enough, Gov. Matt Bevin cautioned at the National Governors Association meeting in July. Louisiana: Land loss More than 2,000 square miles of Louisiana have slipped into the Gulf of Mexico since 1932. (Even a lab that studies flooding might have to move because of rising waters.) Encroaching seas are only partly to blame; erosion and subsidencesinking of the land because of its underlying geologyallow water to encroach farther than it otherwise would. The loss of storm-surge-buffering wetlands also puts the shoreline at greater risk during severe weather. Hundreds of thousands of homes, economically important fisheries, and tourist centers like New Orleans are all in the danger zone. Now, the state has a plan to fortify the coast. Initiatives include restoring wetlands, and breaching barriers to reconnect the Mississippi River with its floodplain and deliver land-building sediment. But finding enough funding to implement the $50 billion plan has been a challenge, in part because of lower-than-expected oil and gas revenues that help fund the program. Maine: Keeping smog in check This past July, Maine Gov. Paul LePage asked the EPA to exempt much of the state from the Ozone Transport Region air-quality program. Created under the Clean Air Act, the 11-state partnership monitors and limits emissions that cross state lines. Under the regulation, the Pine Tree States paper and lumber mills must cut pollutants such as the volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog. LePage, at the behest of the forest-products industry, contends that Maine contributes little to the Northeasts smog issue; environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Council of Maine, however, say that the coalition is why the states ozone levels remain low, and that backing out would only dirty up their air. Maryland: Protecting the Chesapeake The Chesapeake Bay defines Maryland. The estuarythe third largest in the worldruns down the states middle, and generates billions of dollars each year in recreation, tourism, and seafood revenues. For decades, pollution from industries, farms, and cities in the watershed was so severe that crab and oyster populations shrank, spurring the EPA to mandate a cleanup in 2010. Halfway to the 2025 deadline, progress has been uneven: The watershed states (Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Yorkplus Washington, D.C.) have cut phosphorus and sediment, but, according to a July report, theres still too much nitrogen. Common in fertilizer, the chemical washes off fields and causes oxygen-sucking algae blooms. The EPA has asked the states for specific nitrogen-reduction plans in the next phase of restoration. In some corners of the Bay watershed, cities are also struggling to cope with a 55 percent increase in heavy rains. Ellicott City, a nearly 250-year-old town in Howard County, has experienced two once-in-a-millennium-level floods within two yearsthe latest delivering 8.4 inches of rainfall and a 17-foot surge. Hydrologists suspect a number of factors are to blame, including the conversion of forests to pavement and a lack of flood infrastructure. Parts of Baltimore, Anne Arundel, and Prince Georges counties also dealt with increased flooding this year, but the states elected officials are divided over what to do. They passed a measure in 2012 requiring municipalities to reduce the risk by installing new flood-taming infrastructure paid for by a new stormwater fee; The law was repealed after critics maligned it as a rain tax, but environmental advocates and affected residents are pushing officials to reinstate it. Massachusetts: Aging gas lines A series of explosions along natural-gas pipelines in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, Massachusetts, on September 13 killed one person, injured 25, and sparked several fires. The event has focused attention on delivery safetyespecially in states with aging infrastructure. Initially, inspectors found that the pressure in the pipes just before the explosions was 12 times whats normal : 6 pounds per square inch instead of 0.5 pounds; a recent report tips ongoing repairs on old iron pipes as the root cause. Families affected by the blast have filed a class-action lawsuit against Columbia Gas of Massachusetts for negligence. Massachusetts has some of the oldest conduits in the country, and the incident has drawn the attention of officials elsewhere who are also dealing with the problem of outdated infrastructure. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration have issued warnings to utilities that aging pipelines need to be replaced for years. But it isnt cheap: New pipelines can cost more than $1 million per mile. Michigan: Updating infrastructure to prevent water poisoning Four years after lead contamination in Flints drinking water made national headlines, Michigan has adopted the strictest lead rules in the U.S. In June, regulators finalized requirements to eliminate lead service lines by 2040. As a state, we could no longer afford to wait on needed changes at the federal level, Gov. Rick Snyder said in a statement. Under the new Michigan Department of Environmental Quality standards, public water utilities will have to swap out the states 500,000 lead pipelines, and cut the amount of lead in drinking water below 12 parts per billion (the EPA limit is 15 ppb). Utilities, which will have to pay for the work, say replacing the lines will be too costly and wont necessarily prevent another Flint-like crisis. A big part of the problem there, they note, is that the city failed to add anti-corrosion chemicals when it switched its water source to the Flint River. The new rules do not require corrosion-control evaluations when municipalities turn to alternate sources. Gubernatorial candidate and former State Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer has proposed a replacing the states aging water infrastructure faster. Her opponent, state Attorney General Bill Schuette, led the investigation of the crisis that resulted in charges against 15 former and current Flint and state officials. Minnesota: Minding mining The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is famous for its crystalline waters, evergreen forests, and moose herds. But just upstream in Superior National Forest lie rich deposits of copper and nickel, and mining companies are making a new bid to plumb the precious metals. Amid concerns from some residents, the outdoor recreation industry, and some lawmakers that the earth-moving could send mercury and arsenic into the protected area, the Obama administration placed a moratorium on mining in the area in late 2016. The Trump White House has peeled back those rules and recently gave Twin Metals Minnesota (a subsidiary of a Chilean company) the go-ahead to dig on the lands. Another firm, PolyMet Mining Co., wants to extract copper and nickel in the nearby Lake Superior watershed. The issue has divided residents: Outdoor recreation outfitters and environmental groups are suing to overturn the decision. Meanwhile, mining interests, some labor unions, and a few politicos are defending the mines as job creators. Rep. Rick Nolan, who angled for the lands to be opened up (theyre in his district), is not running for re-election; both candidates vying for his seat, Pete Stauber and Joe Radinovich, also support mining in the area, as do gubernatorial hopefuls Tim Walz and challenger Jeff Johnson. Mississippi: Rebuilding bridges Failing infrastructure is a problem across the country, but in Mississippi, its a full-blown crisis. Nearly 500 bridges are in such disrepair that the state Department of Transportation (DOT) had to close them in some cases isolating rural residents. Communities and local businesses are pressing Magnolia State lawmakers to fix the deteriorating thoroughfares, but measures to deal with the problem have yet to gain traction. After the tax-averse legislature failed to pass a repair plan this past March, Gov. Phil Bryant announced that the DOT would immediately close another 83 bridges. Engineers and inspectors deemed the aging crossings unsafe for vehicles. Missouri: The fake-meat debate Missouri has become the epicenter of a fracas between meat producers and the burgeoning fake meat industry, a market that has jumped 24 percent since 2015. This past May, the legislature passed a bill that bars makers of flesh substitutes from using the word meat on their labels. Backed by the Missouri Cattlemens Association and pork producers, the bill could stifle growth of a new industry, according to meat substitute producers. Columbia-based Beyond Meat, for instance, could likely have to change its name, and warns that the measure could result in job loss. The company, together with University of Missouri researchers, has developed plant-based burgers, chicken strips, and sausages that closely resemble real meat. Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown says the bill would do little to convince consumers to opt for the real thing. In late August, vegan food maker Tofurky, along with the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, filed suit against the state, arguing that the new law stifles free speech and hampers competition. Montana: Land use What activitiesmining, logging, livestock grazing, recreationshould and should not be allowed on Montanas 27 million acres of federal land has been a flashpoint in Big Sky Country for decades. This year, access advocates have 29 Wilderness Study Areas in their sights, but these untrammeled tracts are good candidates for permanent congressional protection. At the behest of state lawmakers, Rep. Greg Gianforte has introduced two bills in Congress to allow logging and mining on the largely untouched areas. Environmental groups argue the lands, which total 690,000 acres, are worth protecting. At public discussions on Gianfortes bills held in Augustincluding one hosted by challenger Kathleen WilliamsMontanans expressed a range of views on the measures: Some are worried about the impact on wildlife and ecosystems, while others hope for access for off-road vehicles and economic gains from diversifying permitted uses on the lands. Nebraska: Expanding internet access Nebraskas 1.9 million residents are spread over 76,824 square miles of land, making it one of the nation's most sparsely populated states. This dispersion presents a huge challenge in connecting households and farms to the internet. According to census data, 81 percent of homes in the Cornhusker States metro areas have internet access, compared with 73 percent in smaller cities and rural areas. The gap can be perilous: Many can drive two hours or more to reach medical care; a connection would allow them to use telemedicine for quicker diagnoses and earlier treatment. Access can also help farmers become more efficient and competitive by allowing them to employ sensors and other networked systems to monitor metrics like soil moisture and crop health. While competition among providers has hindered progress in some states, in Nebraska, companies like Cox Communicationswhich used a state grant to wire up a Wi-Fi bus are collaborating with regulators to address digital deserts. A new law signed by Gov. Pete Ricketts this past April created a multidisciplinary Rural Broadband Task force and authorized the state Public Service Commission to give grants to companies that submit the lowest-cost bids for connectivity measures. Closing the rural digital divide is an all-hands-on-deck exercise, says Gus Hurwitz, a telecommunications expert at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Nevada: Debating the fate of Yucca Mountain In Nevadas tight senate race, both incumbent Sen. Dean Heller and challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen claim to be the most capable of quashing a controversial 30-year-old plan to build the U.S.s only permanent, high-level nuclear-waste storage facility in Nevada. Developing Yucca Mountain, a volcanic rock ridge about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, has been fraught since Congress identified the site in 1987. Continued concerns over groundwater contamination and the potential for spills during transport ended with the Obama administration mothballing the project in 2009. Now, amid a new push for nuclear power, the dormant programwhich proponents say is the safest option for storing such wastemight get a revival thanks to a House vote and a proposed $120 million White House budget boost, both aimed at expediting Yuccas Nuclear Regulatory Commission license. New Hampshire: Maintaining renewable-energy growth New Hampshire is at a crossroads in its efforts to produce more renewable energy. Under a 2007 state rule, utilities must include more green power in their mix of sources. The 2018 target is 18.7 percent; by 2025, that target will be 25.2 percent. Granite State lawmakers recently passed bills to goose both the solar- and timber-based biomass industries, but only one survived the governors veto pen. The failed measure would have quintupled the allowable size of solar projects that qualify for net metering (the practice of selling excess power back to the grid). But incumbent Gov. Chris Sununu, who faces renewable-energy advocate Molly Kelly, nixed the measure, saying it would drive up electricity pricesalready some of the highest in the nation. Lawmakers did, however, override his veto for a law requiring utilities to buy more power from six faltering biomass plants in the state. But the Energy Justice Network and other critics question whether biomass should qualify as a clean renewable: Burning wood emits sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates, as well as heat. Still, proponents point out, biomass produces far fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels : 18 grams of CO2 (equivalent) per kilowatt hour, compared to 840 for oil and 1,001 for coal. New Jersey: Getting a grip on stormwater The Garden State is covered in more pavement and cement than any other; hardscapes make up 12 percent of its area. When it rains, rather than seeping into the ground, the water funnels into storm drains, often overwhelming aging pipes and washing pollutants from parking lots and roads into waterways. In some places, especially in many of the states older cities such as Newark and Trenton, drainage and sewer infrastructure combine in one system, adding even more pollutants to the mix. Jersey lawmakers are considering allowing municipalities and counties to establish stormwater utilities; these new public works would receive funding from fees placed on property owners based on how much pavement and rooftop area they have. New Mexico: Drought The average annual temperature in New Mexico has risen about 2.7 degrees over the past 45 years, making it one of the fastest-warming states in the union. Climate-change-fueled drought has dewatered long stretches of the Rio Grande, withered crops, and forced ranchers to reduce cattle herds. A lack of planning by state water managers and government officials experts have warned of more-frequent drought for years hasnt helped. The parched conditions also have turbocharged the natural fire cycle; as of late September, 26 large forest fires had burned across the state. With the consequences of climate change at residents doorsteps, managing it is a recurring theme on the campaign trail. Gubernatorial candidate Michelle Lujan Grisham vowed to ramp up renewable energy development, calling for 50 percent of the states electricity to come from climate-friendly sources by 2030and reach 80 percent by 2040. The efforts could bolster the states solar industry, which could be hurt by Trump administrations solar tariffs. New York: Restoring water quality The Empire State has a lot of water cleanup ahead. According to the state Department of Environmental Conservation, as of this past August, 54 bodies of water have harmful algae blooms rapidly growing nutrient colonies that can kill marine life and cause illness in humans. Fueled by warming waters, blooms lace both salty areas such as the Long Island Sound and freshwater deposits such as the Finger Lakes. At the same time, industry might also be compromising the wet stuff. In 2015, residents of Hoosick Falls, a village in eastern New York, discovered the chemical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in its water supply, blaming the nearby Saint-Gobain Performance Plastic manufacturing plant. Though the state sided with the villagers and set aside $25 million for relief efforts, the town is still waiting on an alternative source of H2O. Lawmakers are addressing the states overall clean-water issues broadly: Theyve passed $2.5 billion in funding to replace pipes and install new treatment systems; estimates from the state comptrollers office, however, put the cost of proper plumbing closer to $40 billion. North Carolina: Regulating coal ash In the Tar Heel State, officials are grappling with how to handle a nasty byproduct of coal-fired power: the toxic ash that incinerated carbon leaves behind. After a 2014 ash spill in the Dan River, state lawmakers directed Duke Energy to close off and contain all 32 of its North Carolina ash basins. But stored waste and chemicals such as arsenic and lead can still continue to seep into the waterways. ( Hurricane Florence floodwaters have further exacerbated the issue, breaching two containment dams.) In April, the state Department of Environmental Quality fined the coal company $156,000 for ground- and surface-water contamination from ash stored at its power plantsthe latest in a series of fines. Advocates, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, however, say the state should strengthen cleanup requirements, particularly in light of the EPAs July decision to toss 2015 federal standards and give states greater authority to set coal-ash regulations. North Carolina is also home to the worlds only population of red wolves, a species poised for a ( second ) extinction. After hunting and other threats led the carnivores to be declared extinct in the wild, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced a colony in 1987. Today, only about 40 remain, and wildlife advocates fear that a new Interior Department plan to allow landowners to kill wolves outside their protected habitat could wipe out the rest. North Dakota: Preserving air quality Vast and sparsely populated, North Dakota has historically had some of the best air quality in the nation. Bismarck, for example, ranks among the American Lung Associations top five least-polluted cities. But a recent oil-and-gas surge is testing the states ability to balance economic development with environmental protection. In July, Meridian Energy Group began constructing an oil refinery about 3 miles from Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The company claims the facility will provide 200 permanent jobs, but a trio of advocacy groups, including the Dakota Resource Council, are concerned that the resulting pollution will foul the parks air. The groups sued the state in July; the plaintiffs contend that Meridian underestimated how much sulfur, methane, and other pollutants the facility will emit, and that the state health departments monitoring requirements are inadequate. The legal challenge to the facilitys permit was dismissed in September; other suits are still pending Ohio: Finding opioid solutions The opioid epidemic is a top campaign issue for gubernatorial nominee Richard Cordray, a former consumer-protection official in the Obama administration. Hes openly blamed his opponent, current state Attorney General Mike DeWine, for a 20 percent spike in drug fatalities from 2016 to 2017largely driven by an increase in fentanyl use. Ohio has one of the highest opioid-related overdose death rates in the nation. But opioid experts note that theres little an attorney general can do to aid treatment or stop doctors from over-prescribing the drugs. DeWine did sponsor law-enforcement training as well as sued drugmakers and distributors for downplaying the addictiveness of such meds. Through the states job-creation agencys Third Frontier program, Ohio also offered $20 million in grants for innovative solutions, including a $3 million effort to develop abuse-resistant opioids. Oklahoma: Earthquakes from oil and gas development Earthquakes in Oklahoma are up about 13,000 percent in the past decade, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. The uptick coincides with an increase in oil and gas developmentmore specifically, the practice of injecting wastewater into deep wells. Several landowners and the Pawnee Nation have sued natural-gas companies over resulting property damage. But the case is difficult to make: While a new study published in the journal Science suggests injection wells can trigger tremors several miles away, and a 2015 report from the Oklahoma Geological Survey linked the wells to property damage, its hard to connect damage from a rumbler directly to a specific constellation of wells. A federal court recently dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed by homeowners. Current state laws wont do much to prevent further damage: A 2016 measure allowed the oil-and-gas authority to regulate how much wastewater goes into wells; the effort reduced minor tremors but did little to curtail the bigger ones, prompting calls to further limit the practice. Oregon: Curbing pollution to protect water From sea to peak, Oregon is struggling with the consequences of climate change. Its low-elevation mountain snowpackwhich provides crucial river flows for cities, farms, and fish when it melts each springis shrinking faster than similar reserves elsewhere in the West. The states saltwater resources are in trouble too. A 2017 study by Oregon State University found that increased carbon pollution has spiked ocean acidity along the Pacific Coast, making the area one of the worst in the world for oysters, crabs, and other marine life. But even as Oregon launches a collaborative working group of scientists, fishermen, and wildlife and agriculture officials to find workable solutions, legislative efforts to pass an emissions-reduction program have sputtered. Supporters hope a proposed cap-and-trade measure, which would require the states biggest CO2 emitters to either reduce their output or buy overages from other businesses, will finally pass in the 2019 legislative session. Pennsylvania: Figuring out fracking The Keystone State sits atop one of the richest natural-gas deposits east of the Mississippi, making it a poster child in the national debate over hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Opponents of the drilling techniquewhich involves pumping sand and a largely unknown chemical cocktail deep into the ground to pry open rock fissures and release trapped gasscored a major victory this past spring. The Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled that creating gas-releasing fractures that extend beneath neighboring property amounts to trespassing. Analysts expect the ruling to inspire a wave of similar suits across the country. Meanwhile, politicians remain at loggerheads over the issue: While a new set of regulations in 2016 gave the state the authority to institute their own safeguards for drilling near public-water resources, industry advocates in the legislature continue to fight further restrictions. Puerto Rico: Preparing for the next storm Puerto Rico is still recovering from the 2017 hurricane season, which saw two storms pummel the territory, leading to more than 2,975 deaths the worst natural disaster in its history. The local Climate Change Council says the island remains unprepared for the realities of intensifying storms, severe droughts, and eventual 2-foot sea-level rise that scientists predict. Delayed decisions may cost human lives, destroy critical infrastructure, and damage the economy, the council wrote in a 2013 report. Yet over the past decade, numerous fortification plans have fizzled, and a climate-change bill introduced this past January focused only on cutting emissions. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló Nevares is looking to the 50 states for help by providing more federal funding to preparedness efforts. Hes encouraging Puerto Ricans in other states to vote for representatives and senators who pledge to do so. Rhode Island: Paying for climate resiliency The Ocean State is a national leader in the fight against climate change. It built the nations first offshore wind farm in 2016; it created 15,000 new green jobs; and, in July 2018, Rhode Island was the first state to file suit against fossil-fuel companies for climate-related damages like eroded beaches and the saltwater contamination of groundwater. (Previously, only cities like New York and Imperial Beach, California, had pursued legal action.) The nations smallest state has good reason to be worried: A recent Union of Concerned Scientists analysis warns that by 2045, almost 900 homes will face flooding from rising seas. Warming temperatures contribute to threats like drought and heat waves, but also could heat the oceans, pushing valuable cold-water-loving species like lobster and cod farther north. As the state awaits the fate of its legal challenge against 21 companies, officials are implementing the climate action strategy Resilient Rhody. These initiatives range from restricting and pulling back coastal development to restoring storm-buffering wetlands and improving emergency-response systems. South Carolina: Monitoring oil cleanup In December 2014, residents near the western South Carolina city of Belton spotted pools of gasoline. Theyd discovered that energy giant Kinder Morgans underground Plantation Pipeline had spilled almost 370,000 gallons of gas into a tributary of the Savannah River. While the company has repaired the line, petroleum pollutants such as benzene and toluene continue to seep downstream. Two local groups, Savannah Riverkeeper and Upstate Forever, have filed suit under the Clean Water Act to force Kinder to continue the cleanup. Their case received a boost in May, when the U.S. Court of Appeals denied the companys request for a rehearing though it plans to ask the Supreme Court to review the case. While local officials support the lawsuit, incumbent state Attorney General Alan Wilson has sided with the defendants; his challenger Constance Anastopoulo has been quiet on the issue. South Dakota: Finessing fossil fuels Fossil fuels are front-of-mind for South Dakotans. The upcoming Keystone XL pipeline will cross the state as it ferries oil from Canada to the U.S. Last November, the existing Keystone pipe spilled 210,400 gallons of crude oil onto farmland near the northeastern town of Amherst. Residents worry that the new project will only increase the risk of future accidents. The Cheyenne River Sioux tribe, whose lands lie just downstream of where the conduit would cross the Cheyenne River, has vowed to stop it, while a trio of measures introduced by Democratic state lawmakers to regulate the pipeline industry have run out of gas. Meanwhile, the Mount Rushmore States congressional delegation is united in favor of ethanol. While the biofuels credibility as a clean alternative to fossil sources remains questionable, the industry pumps almost $1 billion into the local economy, and the state is home to the worlds largest producer: POET. In April, the EPA under the Trump administration granted fossil-fuel refineries 25 waivers, excusing them from a 2007 law that would otherwise require them to blend in proportions of biofuels each year. Industry leaders worry the move will decrease demand, and ethanol producers and farm groups sued the EPA over three of the waivers in late May. Tennessee: Strengthening water standards The Volunteer State is awash in water-quality troubles. Exhibit A: Two years after the state lowered stormwater runoff standards for new construction projects, regulators have proposed more easements for real estate developers and transportation officials seeking to pave wetlands and divert streams. Exhibit B: Environmental group Tennessee Riverkeeper is suing the town of Pulaski, an hour south of Nashville, for the release of 30 million gallons of untreated wastewater; when the towns infrastructure overloads during heavy rains, human waste can combine with runoff, overwhelming treatment plants and fouling waterways. Exhibit C: In eastern Tennessee, locals are pushing for the closure of the U.S. Nitrogen plant, which opened along the Nolichucky River in 2016, after a series of pollution violations. Riverkeeper and other groups say tougher regulations, strict enforcement, as well as infrastructure improvements are necessary to solve the states water woes. Texas: Flood management and rural healthcare As Houston continues to recover from Hurricane Harvey, new data from the U.S. Geological Survey confirms that the storm was the biggest rainfall event in U.S. history. It wont be the last: A recent MIT study found theres an 18 percent chance that record rainfall will hit the Lone Star State by 2100. Whether the region will be ready for the next storm is an open question. This past July, the Army Corps of Engineers allocated $4 billion to shore up coastal levees, but much of the flood infrastructure Harvey damaged still has not been fixedand each new storm weakens it further. The state is also still vulnerable to accidental chemical releases, like the one that occurred when a power outage during Harvey led to a fire at the Arkema chemical plant. Thankfully, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in August that the Environmental Protection Agency must require safeguards to prevent the accidental release of toxic chemicals into the air. Healthcare access is also top-of-mind among Texans, especially those in sparsely populated areas. About 36 percent of low-income rural residents do not have health insurance, compared with 29 percent in urban areas, making Texas one of the worst states in the nation for the rural uninsured, according to a report from Georgetown University and the University of North Carolina. To compound the problem, 14 rural hospitals have shuttered since 2010. Residents must rely on urgent-care centers or drive several hours to the nearest city for care. Healthcare advocates, including Dayna Steele, candidate for Texas 36th congressional district, are vocal about closing the gap. Steele has called for the state to incentivize healthcare providers to stay in rural areas and expand broadband connectivity, which could aid in telemedicine. Utah: Protecting public lands This past December, President Trump shrank two national monuments in Utah: Bears Ears by 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante by about half. This past August, a draft plan from the Bureau of Land Management confirmed that the removed acreage would be opened up for mining and drillingprecisely what conservationists at groups like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance had feared. Beehive State politicians say that the monuments, both established within the past 25 years, are an unnecessary restriction on development, but those in favor of protection say the lands are key to keeping wildlife habitats and fossil troves intact. Currently there are five suits in federal court that challenge the presidents move. Those who want to open up the lands are a very small group of people, says Nada Culver, senior counsel and director of the BLM Action Center at the Wilderness Society. Its so hard to see this happening. Vermont: Landfill expansion The Green Mountain States last open landfill, the 78-acre Coventry facility near the Canadian border, could soon become even bigger, much to the chagrin of local residents and some of our neighbors to the north. The owner, Casella Waste Systems, has applied for a permit to expand into 51 acres of adjacent land, which would allow it to take in 11 million more tons of trash and stay open another two decades. But locals worry that the project will contaminate groundwater and nearby Lake Memphremagog, which provides potable water for about 200,000 people in Quebec. Casella officials say they will minimize groundwater pollution risk by double-lining the new addition and funneling any contaminated fluid into storage tanks, but Canadians who live nearby worry those safeguards might not be sufficient. This past July, a member of Canadian Parliament, Denis Paradis, urged Vermont regulators and incumbent Gov. Phil Scott to delay public meetings on the proposed expansion until the International Joint Commission, a body charged with resolving water disputes between the U.S. and Canada, can study potential effects on the lake. In August, officials agreed to hold off on granting the expansion, pending groundwater testing. Neither Scott nor challenger Christine Hallquist has taken a public stance on the expansion. Virginia: Preparing for sea-level rise Rising seas are lapping at states all along the East Coast, but the stakes are especially high in Virginia. Scientists expect levels in the Old Dominion to swell by at least 1.5 feet by 2050, swamping shoreline cities like Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach, and the 4,300-acre naval base in Norfolk. Since the 1980s, the area has experienced a 350 percent uptick in sunshine floodingrising waters from high tides rather than storms. And March data from researchers at the College of William and Mary shows sea-level rise is accelerating : now 5.1 millimeters a year, compared with 4.6 millimeters a decade ago. Officials are deploying patchwork fixes like dikes and porous pavement (which allows water to sink into the ground beneath), but some coastal residents are resistant to what might be the optimal solution: retreat to higher ground with the help of government buyouts. Washington: Taxes for carbon emitters Voters here could make history. The ballot includes a measure to establish a carbon fee, a surcharge on most (but not all) sources of fossil-fuel emissions. If adopted, lawmakers expect the program to raise about $1 billion a year for clean-energy development and other efforts to fight climate change. Starting at $15 per metric ton of carbon, the price would rise by $2 per ton of emissions each year. If Washingtonians greenlight the feewhich enjoys support from environmental, labor, social-justice groups, and local tribesthe state will be the first to adopt a such a scheme. Fossil-fuel companies have spent millions opposing the program, focusing primarily on its exemption for certain polluters, such as a coal-fired power plant set to shutter in 2025. Other critics, such as the group No on 1631, say the fee which would tack 14 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline and about 15 cents a gallon to the cost of home heating oilamounts to a tax that would hit low-income residents hardest. Washington, D.C.: Doubling down on drainage D.C.s drainage is overwhelmed during storms, sending pollutants that normally would run to treatment plants into waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay. The overflow, which is worsening as storms intensify, threatens the regions progress in cleaning up the estuary. In June, the EPA issued the District some of the most stringent water-management directives in the region. The agency called for D.C. to 1) immediately reduce the amount of E. coli washing into the Bay; 2) create more green infrastructure such as gardens, vegetated roofs, and porous pavement that allow rainwater to sink into the ground; and 3) plant almost 7,000 new trees each year, 3,000 more than the previous guidance. Most of the permits Im familiar with in the other [Bay] watershed states dont have these numerical requirements, dont talk about trees, dont talk about street sweeping, dont talk about green roofs, says Lee Epstein, Lands Program director for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. He and other advocates say the new permit is an improvement, but it might not address the stormwater problem swiftly enough. West Virginia: Monitoring natural gas Natural-gas production has increased fivefold in West Virginia over the past decade. Some lawmakers and residents worry that the state will repeat the same policy missteps with the natural-gas industry that it did with coal: imposing only a few regulations to protect water and ecosystems, and offering generous tax breaks that result in little revenue for the state ( the fourth poorest in the nation, with a poverty rate of 17.9 percent). A proposed tax on natural-gas companies from Gov. Jim Justice to fund a pay raise for teachers fizzled this past spring amid strong pushback from industry leaders. Wisconsin: Protecting groundwater Unregulated groundwater pumping by farms has lowered levels in 22 lakes and several streams in central Wisconsin, spurring an outcry from lakeside homeowners, anglers, and environmental advocates such as Clean Wisconsin. Generally speaking, overpumping lowers the water table, causing spring-fed streams to drop as well. Many of these waterways are also polluted. An influx of nitrogen from farming fertilizer has spurred the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to add 242 bodies to the states impaired waters list, bringing the total to 1,124. In some areas, fertilizer and animal-waste runoff is making its way into private wells. In Kewaunee, Wood, and Juneau counties, between 40 and 50 percent of the sources are contaminated with E. coli or nitrates. Literally people have excrement coming out of their taps, says George Meyer, who headed the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources from 1990 to 2002 and is now executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. Meyer and other advocates say the state legislature and Gov. Scott Walkers administration have failed to enforce clean-water rules and groundwater protections; challenger Tony Evers, who has a slight lead over Walker according to a Marquette University Law School poll, has called for strengthening water-safety measures. Wyoming: Combusting over coal More than any other state, Wyomingby far the nations top coal producerstands to economically benefit from the Trump administrations decision to scuttle the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which set strict limits on carbon emissions from power plants. The new rule encourages coal-fired generators to become more efficient but does not impose a carbon-emissions cap. (Wyoming is one of a dozen coal-producing states that challenged the Clean Power Plan in court.) While analysts expect the changes to prolong the life of a few plants, some point out that coals bigger problem is that natural gas and renewables now outcompete it. The black stuff accounted for about half of the nations electricity 10 years ago, but a series of plant closures have cut production to about one-third. More facilities will likely shutter over the next two years, according to the S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, say they will sue if the Trump plan, which is still being finalized, goes into effect. Cowboy State candidates universally back the coal industry. But at the same time, a new energy source is on the rise in Wyoming: wind. In the next few years, about 5,000 megawatts of new wind energy could come online in the state.","Science A state-by-state breakdown of policies that could change your community.

"""WWE.com Staff""","WWE has hosted 33 Royal Rumble Matches as the event continues making history in its fourth decade. Weve witnessed giants dominate and underdogs stun the field. Champions have been crowned, and roads to WrestleMania have been paved. Weve seen Superstars win their first Rumble Match and multi-time victors.
But who is the greatest Rumbler in history? WWE.com editors have looked back at every winner, from Hacksaw Jim Duggan to Braun Strowman. After much consideration and deliberation, here are the Superstars theyve decided to call Mr. Royal Rumble.
Stone Cold Steve Austin
Stone Cold Steve Austin was so dominant in the Royal Rumble Match that hed do push-ups while waiting for the next entrant. The Texas Rattlesnake, who made his WWE pay-per-view debut in the 1996 Rumble Match, eliminated 36 Superstars in six appearances.
Austin owns the record for the most victories with three  1997, 1998 and 2001. In fact, he would have won four if The Corporation hadnt robbed him in 1999. He didnt win with flashy acrobatics, and in one case, he literally stole the victory. Yet, whenever he stepped through the ropes, Stone Cold became the instant favorite. JEFF LABOON
Kane
It may seem a bit odd to compare Kane to the likes of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, but utter dominance is rather easy to spot when you see it in action. Hence, lets dim a spotlight on the 2001 Royal Rumble Match.
The Big Red Machine set the then-record for most eliminations in a single Royal Rumble Match when he tossed out a staggering 11 Superstars. To watch Kane decimate the best of the Attitude Era in one match was to unequivocally see the very best thriving in his element. Kane ultimately finished as the runner-up in that match, but much like Jordan in the 1995 Eastern Conference Semis or Tiger in the 2018 PGA Cup, you dont always have to come out on top to be considered the greatest. RYAN PAPPOLLA
Rey Mysterio
When you start at No. 2, go over an hour to win the 30-Superstar over-the-top-rope bout and make good on your WrestleMania opportunity to become World Champion, you own the Royal Rumble Match. Thats just the way it works. For more than a decade, Rey Mysterio held the record for the longest single stint in a Rumble Match.
Before all the alterations to the January classic, all the special editions, and all the bells and whistles, Rey went the distance, did the thing and ultimately won the championship at WrestleMania. The line starts behind him, literally and figuratively. ANTHONY BENIGNO
Braun Strowman
There are two key factors when it comes to determining who deserves to be known as Mr. Royal Rumble: Ones ability to hurl opponents over the top rope, and opponents inability to do the same to you. The boulderesque Braun Strowman fits the bill in both categories, and he proved it during the Greatest Royal Rumble Match the largest iteration of WWEs over-the-top-rope classic to date.
Of the 50 Superstars competing in the milestone melee, The Monster Among Men eliminated 13, surpassing the Royal Rumble record established by Roman Reigns in 2014. After a bakers dozen of Superstars got those hands, The Monster Among Men went on to win the entire match, making him Mr. Greatest Royal Rumble as well. JAMES WORTMAN
Randy Orton
When it comes time for the Royal Rumble Match, theres no better prepared Superstar than Randy Orton. The Vipers cold, calculating and predatorial method of attack makes him the perfect competitor for the 30-Superstar melee.
Statistically, WWEs Apex Predator is among the Rumbles crème de la crème, having won two Royal Rumble Matches (2009 and 2017) and eliminated 25 Superstars over the 10 Rumbles he has entered. That, along with The Vipers ability to strike out of nowhere, has surely had many Royal Rumble Match entrants dreading the moment when they were taken out by Randy Orton. BOBBY MELOK
Triple H
Mr. Royal Rumble is a title that can easily be bestowed upon Triple H. For starters, he is one of an elite group of Superstars including Hulk Hogan, Batista, Randy Orton, John Cena and Shawn Michaels that have claimed victory in two Royal Rumble matches.
The Games first Royal Rumble Match victory came in 2002, when he eliminated four Superstars to earn an opportunity for and ultimately win the Undisputed Championship at WrestleMania X-8.His second victory in 2016 made history after The Cerebral Assassin eliminated four Superstars to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. It was only the second time that the Royal Rumble Match also resulted in the crowning of a new world champion. KEVIN POWERS
The Rock
Despite having just one Royal Rumble Match win under his belt, The Rock always electrified the famous marathon bout. Entering at No. 4 in the 1998 Royal Rumble Match, he proved his mettle by logging 51 minutes and coming in second to last before getting eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin.
Hed up the ante two years later by eliminating the mighty Big Show in what became one of the most talked about Royal Rumble Match conclusions. Given his rich history at the Royal Rumble event, The Great Ones contributions continue to leave the millions (and millions!) in awe.

 Quality Construction
Before you jump to the list, we feel its beneficial for you to know what makes an excellent pair of work boots. Ultimately, you want an all-star pair with adequate foot support so you can lower the potential for injuries, cut down on physical stress, and bump up your productivity in the field. Lets take a look at what exactly makes a quality pair of work boots for your feet.
Sturdiness: An excellent pair of work boots should be well-constructed to last a solid amount of time. Nobody wants to drop a ton of money on footwear that will start breaking down in a month. Leather or synthetic welt, which involves stitching a strip of material to the upper and lower sole, creates a rugged construction to last years.
Fit: The fit of any pair of footwear is detrimental to how theyll serve you. Even if you grab a pair of boots made by a credible brand, they still may not suit you well. There are many factors to consider in the construction, including the break-in period, the weight of the boots, upper materials, the lining, and more. We advise you to go into a physical store to try on work boots and spend some time walking around in them before making a commitment.
Materials: If youre going to get a pair of work boots, you cant beat leather construction. Yes, there are boots out there made from exceptional synthetic and mesh, but leather is typically best. In addition, the shank material and shape is also significant, as they determine the stability and posture of the footwear. Test out boots with steel, fiberglass, and plastic shanks to see which one feels ideal for your feet.
Soles: Usually, the outsoles of work boots are constructed from flexible synthetic rubber to cut weight so you can be as light as you can on your toes without sacrificing durability. If youre on your feet the whole day, but dont move around much, getting boots with plenty of cushioning is ideal. If you’re in constant motion on the job, stick to insoles with a sufficient amount of cushioning, but nothing excessive.
Safe Toes: Toe safety is crucial for anyone working outdoors or around dangerous equipment. When picking out a pair of work boots, you want to make sure they are equipped with adequate toe protection. There are the steel toes, which are the heaviest option, a lighter aluminum option with solid strength, and composite toes usually made from plastic, carbon fiber, or Kevlar, which is the lightest option available.

Jose Antunes,"Virtual Reality immerses you both through sound and vision, and, to a certain extent, touch, but the sense of smell is still missing. Yet, it may soon be another option, when entering virtual worlds.
Virtual Reality promises to make us discover this world and other worlds in unique ways. Now a company wants to take the experience of Virtual Reality to a whole new level, promising to add the sense of smell to the immersion of VR. Feelreal simulates hundreds of smells to immerse you into virtual worlds, and to experience it youll just have to add the Feelreal Sensory Mask to your VR headset.
Feelreal prototype from 2015
The company says that it has chosen distinct scents that accurately simulate the atmosphere of games and movies. Feelreal aromas are safe to inhale and are similar to those used in the food industry. The idea was first presented as a prototype at the Game Developers Conference in 2015, along with a Kickstarter funding campaign that never reached its goal. But Feelreal was back at GDC in 2018  and is back on track, suggesting its Sensory Mask will soon be available through Kickstarter.
Feelreal adds that it has developed a reliable scent generator, that holds an easily replaceable cartridge, containing 9 individual aroma capsules. Users can choose and combine any of the 255 scents available in the Feelreal store, install and change them depending on the type of VR experience they are watching.  All Feelreal aromas are, exclusively designed by acclaimed perfumer, olfactologist, and perfume critic Bogdan Zubchenko. Bogdan is the designer of numerous personal, boutique, and interior fragrances that he created under BZ PARFUMS brand. He used every technique he learned after more than 20 years of olfactory experience to design memorable and diverse aromas for Feelreal.
Feel the rain, the breeze, the scents
The Feelreal Sensory Mask will not only work your sense of smell, because the mask is, according to Feelreal, able to make users feel the rain on your cheeks with our ultrasonic ionizing system, sense the warmth of the desert with safe micro-heaters, enjoy the cool mountain breeze via two powerful micro-coolers and endure the impact when force feedback haptic motors kick in!
Anything from the smell of fresh coffee in the morning or the smell of roses in a VR garden, to the smell of burning rubber on a racetrack or the gunpowder odor can be included in the experiences promised by Feelreal. Compatible with a series of headsets, from the Oculus Rift to Samsung Gear VR or Playstation VR, the Feelreal Sensory Mask can be used, according to the company, for anything from Aromatherapy or Meditation to  Games, but Movies are also included.
The Smellit solution was introduced at the 2011 Lisbon Design Show in Portugal
From Rick’s Café Américain to Terminator 2
Using the Feelreal player, says the company, it is possible to watch 360 videos like never before.  The list of supported titles is short, but its not difficult to imagine the potential of the idea, if it works. Watching Casablanca while having all the scents expected from a place like Rick’s Café Américain, or Out of Africa while feeling the warm breeze and scents from the land at the foot of the Ngong Hills, may well contribute to a more intense cinematic experience despite the fact that wearing a mask for watching films may look strange, besides being uncomfortable!
Trying to immerse audiences in the show has always been a goal of the industry, though. If you remember those cinema experiences from the 70s with Sensurround, those low-frequency sounds designed more to be felt than heard, then the idea of having all your senses touched during a cinematic experience is not completely new. Although Sensurround became impractical as a permanent feature of cinema, sound, along with a brief jolt of the theater seats that made the spectators jump with fear, and water sprinkled from above, were used in attractions such as the T2 3-D: Battle Across Time, designed as a mini-sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which I had a chance to watch at the Universal Studios Hollywood, when it debuted, in the mid 90s.
Scents in films go back to 1906
In fact, the idea of using scents in games and movies is not even new. Ive in my archives a colorful CD given to me at an industry event, either the ECTS games fair in the UK or the E3, in Los Angeles, back in the late 90s, which was a press kit from a company promising to introduce the sense of smell to computer games. The project never turned into a product, and the long history of companies trying to make it happen has to include the names of Digiscent, with its iSmell, said to be able to transform the entertainment-media spectrum, all the way from Web surfing to Hollywood movies, AromaRama, Smellit or  Smell-O-Vision.
Although never popular, the use of scents in conjunction with film is nothing new as, in fact, it goes back to 1906, before the introduction of sound, according to Wikipedia. And there are multiple stories about failed projects and implementations that never went ahead, from Walt Disneys Fantasia, from 1940, to the 2016 Batman v Superman, at a 4DX theater in New York City, a theater with motion chairs and a number of environmental effects, including rain, wind, lights, fog, and odors.
Philips amBX for vibration and wind
Another company tried to immerse us into virtual worlds, even before Virtual Reality was something you could buy from a shelf and take home with you, using one of modern days headsets. In fact, Philips created amBX in 2001, a technology closely related to its own Ambilight, designed to create ambient light that changes according to what is on the screen of your TV set.  With  amBX Philips took things a step further, creating kits for games that provided not only visual color cues lights on top of a pair of speakers – following the pace of the game, but also accessories to create vibration and wind.
The system had its top product on the Philips amBX SGC5103BD Premium Kit, which included a wrist rumbler for vibration effects, two powerful fans to move air, 2x 16 million colour hi intensity 2.1 160 Watt speaker-lights and sub woofer and the Wall washer light with controller unit to place behind the screen, all for $279 more than a decade ago. I tested the system then and while there were rumors that it would, in the future, incorporate the means to sprinkle water and introduce scents to make the experience more immersive, it never happened.
The Man in the Iron Mask
Philips vision for amBX was ambitious: to give users experiences they did not think possible. The marketing from the company at the time said this: “If youre a gamer, the virtual world reaches out from your screen. You feel the action: the movement of vehicles, shifts in lighting, rumbling explosions, ricocheting bullets, wind in your face. The mix of ambient lighting, vision, sound and tactile sensations mean the gaming experience will never be the same”.  The system was supposed to make it to other consoles and also be used with other media, but in 2008 Philips was already not associated with the technology, which is now controlled by AmBX UK, and used in areas as commercial lighting.
Philips had one thing right: it was easier to create these systems for home use, from games to cinema, than to large audiences. Now, two decades later, were reaching a point where all those dreams can become true. Virtual Reality is now accessible to anyone, and will be even more with the new headsets that will make it to the market in 2019, and a system like the Feelreal Sensory Mask. One question remains: are you willing to look like the Man in the Iron Mask to watch movies at home? With Virtual Reality headsets people already look like bug eyed monsters","Virtual Reality immerses you both through sound and vision, and, to a certain extent, touch, but the sense of smell is still missing.

S Muralidhar,"Unlike the trio of German luxury car brands who have each had their own performance divisions, which have, for decades, created cars like Mercedes-AMGs, BMW Ms and Audi’s RSs, Jaguar LandRover’s attempt at offering souped-up special editions and high performance versions of its road-going cars is only just over a couple of years old. The Special Vehicle Operations division’s first output was the Range Rover Sport SVR and then came the Jag F-Type SVR. Getting into the business of special, high performance vehicles was the right next step in its evolution for JLR; and the company isn’t losing any more time in the game. The F-Type SVR was born out of the Project 7 and soon the Project 8 influenced XE SV would become the fastest production Jag ever. There is more to come later this year from the SVO division, including the F-Pace SVR unveiled at the New York Auto Show earlier this week. In fact, JLR is planning to set up dealership outlets that will focus specifically on just its SVs. These are serious performance cars. But, somewhat similar to the claims made by Mercedes-AMG, Jaguar officials also mention that the intent with SVO vehicles is to offer the duality of track-level performance and everyday driving comfort. That is a claim that finds resonance with the F-Type SVR that I was piloting earlier this week on JLR’s proving grounds in Gaydon, UK. The F-Type SVR has been available for special orders from Indian customers from last year, but I was behind the wheel of the model year 2018 F-Type SVR — which promises even more performance and even better on-edge handling than the predecessor. Design The F-Type was a breakthrough sportscar for Jaguar; its design and performance really setting up the brand to take on serious competitors in the business. For the F-Type SVR, the folks at the SVO division picked out the base model’s original design and its already light, but rigid chassis with its extensive use of aluminium. Performance boost for sports cars is best achieved by a combination of weight reduction and powertrain improvements. The regular F-Type all-wheel drive was already a taut, well-balanced sports car, but its amazing how light-weighting was still possible and from some unexpected components. The SVR’s exhaust system is now Titanium and Inconel, the seat frames are now made out of magnesium and the new set of 20-inch forged alloy wheels save about 13 kg compared to the alloys in the regular F-Type. The rear suspension knuckles have been redesigned and constructed to be lighter than the conventional knuckles and the carbon-ceramic matrix braking system (optional addition) offers another 20 kg of weight reduction over the conventional F-Type. The F-Type’s design has largely been retained for the SVR; much of the changes are focused on improving the aerodynamics. With one of the performance targets being a top speed of 320kmph, the F-Type SVR gets extra bits like an active carbon fibre rear spoiler with a wider and more elevated wing, a flat front underbody and additional, larger front fender and hood vents as part of its aero package. The car continues to look stunning in profile with its classic two-seater sports car proportions — the long bonnet, the elegantly curved roofline, the strong rear haunches and the low, compact stance — is now complemented by the SVR’s improvements. The F-Type is offered with multiple engines and trim levels. Performance Not to be confused with the regular F-Type and its four-cylinder engine or the 400 Sport and its V6, the SVR features the 5.0-litre V8 supercharged petrol engine found in the F-Type R, but tuned to deliver a higher 575 hp of peak power and 699.6 Nm of peak torque. In fact, the powertrain set-up is borrowed from the Project 7, with adjustments to the eight-speed gearbox and a whole new calibration for the car’s adaptive dynamics set-up. The all-wheel drive system is a carry over, but the algorithm for torque vectoring has been reworked to cut the possibility of understeer. A rework of the electric power steering’s set-up also means that the F-Type SVR’s wheel offers more feedback and a very likeable directness in response, best felt during high speed turn-ins. At the Gaydon track, one of the first tests was on the high speed long track, which with its four lanes and long straights is strangely called the emissions circuit. The F-Type SVR’s visceral acceleration comes through with the needle racing to speeds of upto 280 kmph effortlessly. Its rated acceleration is 3.7 seconds for the 0-100 kmph run. On the track, I recorded 225kmph on the speedo with just about 2.6 km of the tarmac behind me. The F-Type was loud with its grunty exhaust note egging you on to keep engaging the engine. The SVR sounds louder, though the difference is probably marginal. For all those who have been woken up by an eager owner’s F-Type in the neighbourhood, the stat to keep in mind is that the exhaust note is a whisper short of the legal limit. The F-Type SVR’s improved AWD settings and steering response come into play at the turns on the circuit, offering a huge jump in confidence levels. The four turns are mostly wide, sweeping ones, but it was the speeds at which the SVR could take them on that made the difference. With quick, measured corrections, the F-Type SVR could do much higher speeds than were recommended for the turns. The improvements to the suspension also make it surprisingly composed on bad roads, which was simulated in the next stretch of tarmac that I test drove the car on. With the setting expectedly focused on agile handling, the broken patches, rumbler strips and uneven tarmac on this track didn’t leave me with a sore backside; and for a change I was keen on putting those 265/35 Pirellis into the holes and not around them. Bottomline The F-Type SVR cabin gets some additions too, including the option of a carbon-fibre roof. There are some more trim elements in carbon-fibre within the cabin and then there are the new lozenge-quilted special edition SVR seats for the driver and passenger. These seats are now adjustable in 14 different ways too. Most other additions are subtler and focused on improving the materials on offer. The standard F-Type features for the cabin including the touchscreen infotainment system and the 10-speaker Meridian audio system are also standard in the SVR. The fastest Jaguar just got better for its 2018 model year edition. It is certainly far more composed and predictable on the edge compared to the other F-Type models. But the F-Type SVR is certainly not for the average Joe looking for a luxury car. Prices will be ₹2.6 crore or thereabouts.",Jag’s 2018 F-Type is a serious sportscar and will shout you down with its exhaust note if you argue,2018-03-29T16:46:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thehindubusinessline.com'}","Quicker, Faster, and Louder!",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/auto-focus/jaguar-2018-f-type-svr-first-drive-review-test-drive/article23385320.ece,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/auto-focus/article23385313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BL30Auto2Lead1,,Thehindubusinessline.com,rumbler,1
SurvivalBlog Contributor,"(Continued from Part 2. This installment concludes the series.)
The Homestead
We ultimately settled on a home with some acreage. The hilarity ensued as we moved farm animals (cue the Benny Hill music), hay, our combined supply of preps, furnishing, farm equipment, and other items. The move took weeksliterally weeks. We fell into bed each night, exhausted and cranky. As much fun as all this sounds, our regular full-time jobs and household chores continued. By the time the last load was hauled, we had injured backs, knees, and ankles And the work was just beginning. Fortunately, the skills I learned through trial and error while living at the Slightly Cockeyed Cabin were all easily transferable to our new homestead.
American Redoubt Gardening
The one thing I hadnt mastered at my rental home was a garden, and I was eager to install one at our new homestead. My husband kindly installed 10-foot posts and deer fencing for a 30 x 30-foot garden. We later learned that rabbits will chew right through deer fencing material, so if you want to make your garden truly pest-proof, youll need to dig down along the perimeter and install hardware cloth that extends up from the ground about 3 feet. Yes, its a pain. In fact, everything about gardening here is a pain. I cant emphasize how much hard work it is. Except for the Clearwater River Valley in Idaho and a few other low-elevation places, gardening in most of the Redoubt is only for the insane or highly-optimistic. Fortunately, Im both. And, as if to prove that gardeners are Gods favorite people, we have daylight in most areas of the Redoubt until 9:30 PM or later each summer evening, allowing us gardeners to enjoy our hobby for many hours after our day job ends.
While most experts suggest that you start small, I disagree. My motto is GO BIG! Go ahead and get your garden infrastructure in place and make it as large as you imagine you will ever need. (After only a few years, I wished that  I had made my garden footprint larger.) Youll probably need some good soil delivered, too, as our soils tend to be poor. I advocate that you start large because any area you cant garden (due to time restrictions, cost, etc.) can simply be covered with cardboard and a thick layer of straw. Then, when youre ready (or if theres an urgent need for it), its there waiting for you. In the meantime, you can toss in any compost you may have, steadily building up your own healthy soil for future use.
After much trial and error, straw became my number one favorite garden helper. It not only keeps weeds at bay, but it helps keep the soil from drying out in our arid climate. And, after living on our homestead for a few years, I had several nice piles of mellow cow poo accumulated from cleaning the corrals. This aged cow poo is a wonderful amendment to the soil in my garden. (Note: I dont recommend horse poo it creates more weeds.)
Short Growing Seasons
Getting the hang of a much shorter growing season will take some practice, but theres nothing quite like the joy of picking June strawberries, fresh kale, tarragon, artichokes (a surprising success in my garden!), Egyptian onions, cherry tomatoes, and broccoli. I have gardened now for 3 years with no pesticides or fertilizers (other than our cow poop). Just as I start to panic (the cabbage moths are destroying the cabbage!!), wasps arrive and eat the moths, then birds arrive and eat the wasps. From May until September, I marvel steadily at Gods natural order unfolding in my garden. I highly recommend mixing perennial flowers into your vegetable garden. Flowers attract pollinators and bring a source of comfort and beauty, during both good times and bad. Just dont be surprised to walk outside one sunny morning in July to find snowflakes on your blooming roses
If youre looking to add some native berry bushes, Id suggest contacting the Nature Conservancy of your Redoubt state and inquire about their springtime bare-root sale. You can usually purchase bare-root berry bushes for about 10-25 cents per sprig. Its a great deal!
For those from warmer climates, youll need to get used to bringing your water hose inside on cool evenings or stretching it out on a slope, so the water can drain. Otherwise youll have the unpleasant surprise of a solid chunk of ice inside your garden hoses during those cooler spring days. Also, unscrew your hose from outside spigots to prevent freeze damage. At the end of the garden season, oil the wood handles on your garden tools and store them in a shed and theyll last you for years.
Join your local garden club and take the Master Gardener classes offered by your county extension agent. These are going to be some of the nicest people youll meet, and they offer a wealth of information. Despite reading all I can, I found that many of my gardening successes were simply accidental. For instance, my attempts to grow foxglove failed miserably for 4 years in a row. Then, this past summer I grumbled at a patch of weeds that had somehow escaped my attention. As I looked closer, I realized a multitude of foxglove plants were now thriving in a location that they (not I) had selected. They created a delightful display throughout the summer. Try new things. There are many micro-climates in the Northern Rockies and it requires trial and error to learn what grows in your area. Cultivating a garden also cultivates patience, humility, and a sense of wonder.
Water System and Wells
Our best advice is to hire a well drilling firm who uses geologists. Around here, water is a prized commodity and water-witching doesnt beat out science, statistically speaking. You dont want to end up with an expensive hole in the ground, so use a geologist, and then pray. You may have to settle for a much lower yield than what you were used to back east, and the well may be a lot deeper, too, adding to the overall expense. We installed a Simple Pump hand pump which works to a depth of 300 feet. It is an important part of our redundant water system plan and serves as a final back up should we no longer have a functioning electric well pump. If that were to occur, we have enough heavy-duty hoses (and patch kits) to allow us to connect a hose to the hand pump and fill livestock water troughs. Ideally, though, automatic waterers are the most convenient way to go (but will cost around $400-500 each). Consider where you would want these located, and if possible, have the water lines run at the same time the well work is being done. (Its easier than having your property torn up twice.) Consider installing frost free spigots at critical locations on your property.
Wildfires are just part of life here. We partnered with the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to obtain a grant for fire mitigation work. It didnt cover all our costs, but it helped. Grants are prioritized by highest scores, and there are many factors that can give your application additional points, such as veteran status or being adjacent to a property which has already been mitigated to NRCS standards. Theres never any guarantee, of course, but the NRCS can show you some rather convincing photographs of how fire mitigation can potentially save your home and property from destruction. The process should leave you with wood to use as a heat source and wood chips for mulching your garden paths. If you are hiring a contractor to do the project, be sure to communicate your goals (i.e. how much wood chips you want versus having wood to process as fire wood). Also, walk your property and mark any special trees that you dont want to lose in the process.
Heating
Head into winter with plenty of wood and a topped-off, large propane tank. All it takes is one rough winter and the propane trucks might not be able to reach your homestead due to heavy snow. We went from one 500 gallon above-ground tank to burying two 1,000-gallon tanks underground and have been steadily changing over all our appliances to propane. Having our propane tanks underground prevents us from losing all our propane to an errant bullet and gives better op-sec. (Even so, one of our neighbors noticed that we had buried the two tanks.) While doing some remodeling on the house, my husband installed a 45,000 BTU furnace-rated fireplace that can range down to 7,000 BTUs on its lowest setting, which allows us to use it during a slightly cool summer evening without the house getting too hot.
Our home came with an electric pellet stove, which many people consider a nice upgrade. While it might have seemed counter-intuitive, we removed the nice upgrade, sold it, and replaced it with a Pacific Energy Alderlea T6 wood burning stove, with the intent of using the supply of fire wood we had laid in from our fire mitigation project. The Alderlea T6 has a small footing, puts out 90,000 BTUs, looks attractive, has the option for a nice-sized glass door, and it also has a cook-top surface and really cool trivets that swing out, providing a place to set a tea pot or keep a pot of chili warm. Its a fabulous secondary cooking option to supplement our propane kitchen stove. If you didnt inherit your Grandmas cast iron dutch-oven because Cousin Betty-Merle got it, stop pouting, run down to the local sports supply store, and buy yourself a new one. Then start using it on your cook-top wood burning stove!
If there is any blessing that closely approaches that of having a good water supply on your property, its having a gently sloping south or southeast facing property. This will provide warmth and natural lighting for your home, sunlight for your garden, and the benefit of gravity drain systems for water.
Earthquakes
Youll be in earthquake territory when you move to the Redoubt, which will be something new for many folks. Just so you know, your homeowners insurance policy probably does not cover for earthquake damage (just like it doesnt cover for windstorm damage sustained during hurricanes). Ask your insurance agent. We ended up purchasing an additional earthquake rider for our home. A couple years ago we experienced a significant 5.8 rumbler and were totally fine, but it was still a good reminder about why we needed earthquake insurance.
We found that the best way to meet folks is to offer to help them in some way. Or feed them. Or both. For you Southerners, just invite folks over for some shrimp and grits. They may secretly consider it ethnic food but will become converts in an astonishingly short amount of time. Folks in the Redoubt are a bit more stand-off-ish than what Southerners are used to, but on the other hand, they arent all up in your business either, which is nice.
When You Need to Hire Help
There are just some projects that you cant do alone. They require help. Take fencing, for example, or putting up a barn. If your project requires the input, expertise, or assistance of others, plan on it taking twice as long as you think it will. Here in the Redoubt, there are four seasons: fishing season, hunting season, skiing season, and gardening season. People do their jobs in between all those other activities. And, quite frankly, lots of families depend on a successful fishing, hunting and gardening to feed their families. So, be patient. Get a license and learn to fish. The river will be cool and crystal clear, and soon youll understand why everyone is taking so long to return your call about that drywall project youre trying to wrap up
Barns
There are many designs to choose from, but for the Redoubt climate, may I suggest the following:
A lower roof to keep animals warmer, and one designed to accommodate snow load.
Good overhead lighting for the longer dark winter days. Animal drama and emergency vet visits will invariably happen when its dark outside.
Large stalls that can be divided into smaller stalls, allowing greater flexibility when you need to keep a cow/calf pair together, or when you and the veterinarian need to care for a sick animal.
A frost proof spigot inside the barn. Youll thank yourself a million times for this.
Sliding barn doors that allow airflow on two sides of the barn on hot summer days.
Stalls that face south/southeast so they can be opened to the sunshine. If you opt for dirt floors, this will also help keep your ground dry. (Clean dry ground = healthy animals.)
An entry to stalls that is large enough to accommodate a skid-steer. You may not need that equipment right now, but as you progress in age, your aching back and wallet might prioritize a skid-steer over a shovel and wheelbarrow.
If your barn isnt large enough to store hay, then an overhang (with pallets on the ground) will be helpful for hay storage. Again, your back will thank you for storing hay closer to the animals.
Automatic waterers located just outside the barn are an amazing luxury.
Everyones heard the phrase good fences make good neighbors, but they forget that good neighbors make good fences. Chat with your neighbors before you start installing your fence. Have a survey and ask if they have time to walk the path with you, ensuring theres no misunderstandings. Ask permission if you suspect that youll need to access their property with equipment needed to build your fence. If you have workers helping you, remind them to be conscientious about the neighbors property. Generously allow enough setback for snow plowing. And finally, do a good job. Nobody wants to look at a sloppy eyesore that wont safely contain animals.
Summary
This is just a small sampling of things I learned along the way. As you can see, there was a huge learning curve for this citified Southern gal to settle into life in the Redoubt. Theres still more to do. I would like a greenhouse and want to become more proficient at canning produce from my garden. My husband wants a larger squeeze chute for the cows and an outbuilding. Its all a process. The most important thing you can do is keep a sense of humor about it all. We understand. This is serious business that could mean the very survival of your family, but it can also become complete drudgery without the right attitude and some levity along the way.
As I always jokingly say to my husband, All it takes is time and money!. Your homestead in the Redoubt will require both, possibly more than you have at any given time. We often look at various back-breaking, more-than-we-expected-it-to-cost homesteading projects and say: Theres our Hawaiian vacation! Hang onto your dreams, health, friends, family, and Faith. Set priorities, make sacrifices, be prudent and wise, and little by little youll get there.
And to you Southerners who are considering relocation: Dont be worried about all the cold weather just pack your bags and come on out! Yall are going to love it here!","(Continued from Part 2.

If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
""I've been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance,"" says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the city's hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison.
""Europeanizing"" New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention.
""The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing,"" adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last week's NBC ""Saturday Night Live,"" where a ""Weekend Update"" anchor joked that with the European-style siren, ""You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.""
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city's Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex.
At community board meetings, Mount Sinai's Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.
""People hated them all,"" Davis said, ""but the 'high-low' was least intrusive. It didn't have that piercing sound.""
Davis, a 40-year EMS veteran who suffers from hearing damage that he blames on repeated exposure to sirens, said the change was simple and cost effective: All it took was reprogramming the electronic box in each vehicle, which comes preloaded with seven different sounds with names such as ""Wail,"" ''Yelp"" and ""Piercer.""
In fact, many ambulances, fire trucks and police cars are equipped with alternate sirens and horns that they can employ in certain situations, such as in traffic when cars and pedestrians just won't get out of the way. They include short blips and the ""Rumbler"" low-frequency, vibrating siren aimed at motorists who may otherwise be unable to hear higher frequencies.
For some Manhattanites, any change in the city's daily siren song would be welcomed.
""I always have to cover my ears with my hands when a siren-blaring ambulance passes,"" says Louise Belulovich, a Manhattan attorney. ""If I'm carrying packages and unable to, then what is an annoying experience becomes a painful one.""
But Linda Sachs, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side who lives near one of the Mount Sinai hospitals that uses the new European siren, doesn't think the change is for the good. She prefers the old New York standard.
""The old sirens never woke me up, but these make me shudder,"" Sachs says, adding that she understands city lawmakers are attempting to do something about noise pollution. ""But the old sound wasn't as obnoxious.""","If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on the streets of Londo…",2019-02-26T14:33:00Z,"{'id': 'nbc-news', 'name': 'NBC News'}",Sounds of sirens: Noise-weary New York ponders European-style emergency vehicle alarm,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sounds-sirens-noise-weary-new-york-ponders-european-style-emergency-n976081,https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_04/2728151/190124-nypd-car-new-york-cs-232p_a7399a65d023761def1e1f0c904b0550.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg,nbc-news,NBC News,rumbler,1

By Andrew J. Nelson World-Herald staff writer,"The Omaha Police Department has begun installing an additional siren on its new police vehicles that is designed to prevent crashes as officers respond to emergencies. The Rumbler is a low-frequency siren that officers can activate as they approach an intersection while hurrying to a crime or crash scene. It emits more of a bass sound — one that motorists might feel, in addition to hearing. “Research showed that a lot of collisions occur at intersections … when officers are expediting to those high-priority calls,” said Police Detective Justin Smith, who is on the department’s safety committee. The added siren complements the regular, high-pitched siren. The lower frequency should be more noticeable to drivers in modern vehicles. The goal, he said, is to “improve public safety, reduce some collisions, improve officer safety and of course allow officers to get to those high-priority calls.” Bass tones better penetrate objects, including modern automobiles designed to shield their drivers from road noise, he said. Additionally, the contrast of high and low tones will better catch the attention of distracted drivers, he said. The Rumbler is already used by the La Vista Police Department and several others in the Midwest, Smith said. So far, 32 of the newer cruisers have been equipped with the Rumbler. It is not being used in older vehicles for now. “Any officer that has expedited can tell you... drivers tend to be more distracted and you can see they are not typically as aware of the traditional siren,” Smith said. A cost estimate wasn’t immediately available; the devices are being added as part of the cruisers’ total equipment package. That said, one Rumbler for a Ford Explorer costs $755, according to police; one for a police car is $637. The total cost for the current batch is $20,733.

Nintendo Life,"Look outside. Do you see it? Can you sense it? At this very moment, everybody everywhere has Smash Bros. fever. The next-level anticipation for the sequel to the 3DS/Wii U title of 2014 is about to end. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is days away from ( official ) release. For some, this may be their first console Smash experience since Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008, an entire decade ago. (Sure, the Wii U version sold an impressive 5+ million copies worldwide, but compared to the well over 9 million copies sold on the 3DS, let alone the 13+ million copies of Brawl, Nintendo is seeking a console rebound theyre soon likely to get.) Nintendo fans are psyched. Many of them are using the internets social channels like public coping mechanisms to pass the time, the days stuffed with jokes, voting and speculation. But how are the most dedicated fans preparing for Smash? Not those who simply love Kirby and Samus and Greeninja, but superfans who travel the world to compete, analyze intricate frame data the series over, and practice tirelessly, day in and day out not as a hobby, but as a job? In other words, what are professional Smash Bros. players doing leading up to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate? That depends on what kind of professional they are: player, tournament organizer, community organizer, or even announcer. Streaming, Video, and More: The Start of Something Big Gonzalo ZeRo Barrios, one of the most famous Smash players on the planet Much has changed in the gaming world since the last Smash Bros. game came out in 2014. The act of streaming video games obviously existed back then, but now its much bigger. Smash Bros. is also bigger. But how big Nintendos mascot brawler looms on the world stage largely depends on how you look at it. Back in 2014, around the release of Smash for Wii U and 3DS (Or Smash 4, as many refer to it), Twitch had just begun its power swing into becoming the largest streaming gaming site. Then, it was still shy of achieving 100 million viewers a month. One merger with Amazon and a purchase of streaming company Curse later, that number is up to 140 million unique viewers a month. As of this writing, Smash 4 has 1,128,858 followers on Twitch. Thats a lot! But its not a ton relative to other video games.

You might be saying to yourself, Okay, but who cares how many people are watching Smash Bros. on Twitch? Professional Smash players care, thats who. And they think that number is about to grow. Historically lacking major means for support, many Smash pros have recently cashed in on their personal brands to produce streaming audiences, subscription models, monetized ads, and the whole virtual shebang. This may seem obvious, but it hasnt always been this way. Historically, the vast majority of Smash-related video content on the internet consisted of tournament matches between players. Yet in recent years, and ramping up considerably as Nintendo has slowly dripped information about Ultimate, professional matches have been equalled if not totally eclipsed by reaction and speculation videos from the pros. The most popular output from eSports stars on YouTube these days has titles like #ESAMOpinion of ALL CHARACTERS in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, ISABELLE IN SMASH BROS ULTIMATE (Alpharad's Reaction) and MY NEW FAVORITE FALCON COMBO. This scenery change is easily the biggest difference to accompany a Smash Bros. games release within the community, and its a byproduct of almost half a decades time between titles. At the end of the day, building a presence there is by far the most important investment you can make. More so than winning, emphasizes Gonzalo ZeRo Barrios to Nintendo Life, the worlds best Smash 4 player. Nairoby ""Nairo"" Quezada is pleased with how Nintendo is positioning Smash Ultimate All of this online content is tremendously helped along by Super Smash Bros. Ultimates popularity with the world at large. Nintendo is giving the pros an inadvertent lifeline like never before by making their mascot royal-rumbler the choice recipient of huge video reveals, massive convention booths, and millions in digital and physical advertising. This is a mindshare windfall like never before. Theyre treating it like their biggest game ever, honestly, says Nairoby Quezada to Nintendo Life regarding the release of Smash Ultimate. Hes otherwise known as Nairo in the Smash community. [Theres] tons of marketing in place...and a clear nod to the competitive community for some aspects of the game. DRon D1 Maingrette, a former professional player and current Smash Bros. announcer strongly echos these sentiments. Nintendo's efforts to promote Smash Bros. Ultimate are on a way bigger scale than what they did for Super Smash Bros. Wii U, D1 tells Nintendo Life. The amount of tailgate events at schools, exhibitions being held, kiosks erected...you can tell Nintendo's pulling out all the stops. Whether the developers explicitly sought it or not, professional players are seizing this opportunity to capitalize on the popularity of the Nintendo Switch and the marketing machine for Ultimate. More than a few of them are making it their livelihoods, and they want you not to mention the likely larger online audience Ultimate will bring in to smash that subscribe button. Preparing Ultimate for Tournament Life Juan Manuel Hungrybox DeBiedma There are, in fact, many hurdles before professional Smash Ultimate can properly begin as an eSport. The very first question hardcore players have had to answer is whether or not Ultimate will supplant Smash 4. Given the infamous schism in the Smash community after the release of 2008s Brawl, this is surprisingly not a given. However, virtually all agree Ultimate has what it takes. The community is fully prepared and able to make Ultimate the premiere title, says Juan Manuel Hungrybox DeBiedma to Nintendo Life. Smash 4 will die immediately and fade into irrelevance the moment Smash Ultimate is released from the sheer similarity of the games, and from the fact that this will be the most-played (Smash) title worldwide for the next few years. Hungrybox, very arguably the worlds best Smash Bros. Melee player, also believes Melee will maintain its noticeable cult status apart from all Smash Bros. related activity. 17 years after Melees release, few seem to argue that point anymore. With that largely settled, the next logical eSports hurdle is tournament hosting. Will Ultimate earn its footing like Smash 4 before it? Where Will Ultimates Money Come From? One abiding feature of a pro smash player, especially those who have been in the community since the days of Melee and even beforehand, is that of an inferiority complex. To them, its a minor miracle Smash Bros. can now even be talked about in the same breath as, say, Street Fighter V, a series that is financially backed year in and year out by Capcom and its many sponsors. In a way, I like the grassroots raw feel of the Super Smash Bros. scene. It's about family and competition, Bassem Bear Dahdouh tells Nintendo Life. Dahdouh is an eSports event organizer who has helped direct virtually every major Smash Bros. tournament in recent memory. That grassroots feeling is something many Smashers wear as a badge of honour, earned by a decade of corporate neglect, and its still worth noting in 2018 for reasons well neatly emphasize with two statistics: one which explains the scenes biggest strength going into Ultimate, the other, its glaring weakness. First, the strength. By attendance alone, Smash has few peers. Fighting series often start off with a big apex, then dwindle over time. Smash is trending strongly in the opposite direction. Melee took Smash 64 from maybe 30 people to 100 man events. Brawl took Melee from 100 to around 300-person majors. Then Smash 4 pushed us into this 2,500 person EVO territory, recounts Kyle Thinkaman Brockman, community contributor and a moderator at Smashboards.com, the largest online message board dedicated to the series. But then theres the other half of the equation. Consider this: after winning the Smash 4 portion of Evo 2017, Smash player Salem walked away with just over $9,000 after a 60/20/10 earnings split. That was with a whopping 1,515 entrants. The winner of the Injustice 2 portion of that same tournament, which had 632 fewer entrants than Smash 4, won over $35,000. Why? Because Warner Bros. Interactive donated an additional $50,000 to the pot. Its really that simple. Today, through sheer, brute force, individual Smash players themselves continue to make the scene happen, with or without Nintendos financial support. But just as with streaming and videos, the groundwork for a more modern tourney existence has already begun. Nintendos Role A brighter hope for Ultimates eSports future begins, but does not end, with Nintendo themselves. eSport fans are relieved to see Nintendo continually sponsors yearly fighting game tournaments, such as the aforementioned EVO and Genesis events. But far more impressively, many of the features pros have been calculating by hand for years are at last hard-coded into the upcoming game, such as an in-depth frame analysis mode and various tournament modes and menu options. There is reportedly an online mode dedicated to those who earn a certain skill level. And of course, theres the ever important promise of keeping things at 60 fps, no matter what. Not to mention the interesting tidbit that Nintendo has announced Japan-only leagues to play in sponsored events (albeit with items turned on, a major faux-pas in the Smash eSports community). The overall intent is still there, however. But dont hold your breath for Nintendo to drop a huge cash pot on an Ultimate tournament any time soon. Nintendo of America COO Reggie-Fils-Aime has repeatedly dodged the question in interviews, which likely translates to a polite No. The company seems to still prefer supporting its own enigmatic events, like this Japanese league, or the Super Smash Bros. Invitational. To this point, says Dahdouh while citing his intent to continue directing major tournaments, I hope there will be more financial support for events to compensate staff in many areas. The Role of Teams and Sponsors Helping to somewhat offset this major issue are professional team salaries and product sponsorships, akin to the landscape of most every other eSport game out there. This is an area that began in infancy during the Smash 4 era, likely to expand to greater heights for Ultimate. It took Smash 4 a little bit to find its space in the esports realm, begins DeBiedma, but it's basically a solved industry at this point and I have no doubt we will see countless organizations, from S-Tier (Liquid, Cloud9) to startups, all picking up players. Yet one major issue the community has not solved ahead of Ultimate is what, besides the players themselves, companies are able to even sponsor. Quezada casts doubts on current investors looking to expand. To be a Smash player, you only need one thing: a Gamecube controller[and] Smashers only want to buy first-party controllers made by Nintendo. The problem this creates is that when you sign with a team, you [can get] all these sponsors [for] keyboards, cryptocurrency, PCs, and more. Nairo gives the example of streaming Fortnite, where you easily advertise things like headphones and keyboards. I understand right now its really difficult for teams to justify paying a lot of money to a Smash player. Mapping Out the Games Rules and its Guts Last but certainly not least, how have the pros been preparing for the game itself? How are they preparing for character changes? And will the official rules stay the same as in Smash 4, or will they change? Places like Smashboards and of course social media have been booming with terse opinions even before a single official tournament match has been played. Somewhat surprisingly, most every Smash player contacted for this story has bristled from their side of the already heated debate regarding to-be tournament standards dictating number of lives allotted, legal stages, and more. Even with my status as a top player and community leader, I personally dont feel Ill have much say in the ruleset, unfortunately, laments Quezada. In the past, there have been secret groups run behind closed doors by tournament organizers to decide the rules of the game. I've seen this happen for 10 years now with Brawl and Smash Wii U. They havent let players have a say in it due to conflict of interest. Nairo believes this is ultimately unfair to top players. I disagree with that notion and wish everyone in the community could have a say on stages, stocks, timers, etc instead of just one group of people. This is our livelihood for some of us and its largely decided by people who sometimes dont even play the game! But to others, keeping matters out of the hands of the known top competitors is a check and balance that is critical, perhaps now more than ever before the game is about to come to life. Practice, Practice, Practice In terms of characters and gameplay changes, those who have played the game already through special events, in tandem with those who have absolutely torn apart known footage pixel by pixel, have already cultivated an impressive knowledge pool. (There are even pre-release tier lists, for crying out loud.) There isn't a single character that didn't receive very nuanced, detailed changes. Not one, in the preexisting 58, says Brockman. Maingrette sees this as a challenge for his continued role as a professional announcer. This particular Smash game has so many different characters, which means I will have to get ready to study thousands of different match-ups, and memorize a ton of data in order to keep the general public informed with all things related to the game and community. On all those nuanced changes from Smash 4 to Ultimate, Brockman expands: In isolation, many of (the changes) seem odd, but together it all works: The short-hop attack penalty makes no sense without faster jumps, which calls for less landing lag to flow smoothly, which would be problematic without the upgraded shield parry, which could contribute to overly defensive options without dodge decay, which would penalize air dodges too much without the directional option, which requires cast-wide move speed increases to keep punishable, which would make edge guarding lopsided if not for balloon knockback. It just, all fits. Needless to say, from various online dissections to lengthy posts on Smashboards, the hardcore community has kept very, very busy. Everyone Is Here When Smash Ultimate releases worldwide on December 7th, the vast majority of its players will get together with their friends, pick their favourite Nintendo character and just start pushing buttons. In some ways, the pros will be no different. What separates the impassioned from the sternly dedicated will instead be things like intricate YouTube tagging, sponsorship recruitment efforts, video editing and just plain hard work every single day for years to come. This is work that is a continuation of a collective effort stretching out years before Ultimate was even announced. Its what the pros have done to prepare for Smash Ultimate. But if there is one thing that unites both the expert and the amateur more so than any other thing, it's the sentiment summed up neatly after asking Quezada how he feels going into final week before Ultimates release. Its so close man! I cant wait!","""You can tell Nintendo's pulling out all the stops"". Look outside. Do you see it? Can you sense it? At this very moment, everybody everywhere has Smash Bros. fever. The next-level anticipation for the sequel to the 3DS/Wii U title of 2014 is about to end.

By Andrew J. Nelson World-Herald staff writer,"The Omaha Police Department has begun installing an additional siren on new police cars designed to prevent crashes as officers respond to emergencies. The Rumbler is a low-frequency siren officers can activate as they approach an intersection while racing to a crime or crash scene. The added siren complements the regular, high-pitched siren, and the lower frequency should be more noticeable to drivers ensconced in modern vehicles. Bass tones better penetrate objects such as modern automobiles designed to shield their drivers from road noise, and the contrast of high and low tones will better catch the attention of distracted drivers, said Omaha Police Detective Jason Smith, with the department's safety committee. So far, 32 cruisers have been equipped with the Rumbler. As of now, it is not being used in legacy vehicles. A cost estimate wasn't immediately available; Rumblers are are being added as part of the cruisers' total equipment package. That said, one Rumbler for a Ford utility vehicle costs $755.43, according to police. Police demonstrated the device at the city maintenance shop at 26th and Lake Streets on Wednesday afternoon.",The Rumbler is a low-frequency siren officers can activate as they approach an intersection while racing to a crime or crash scene.,2018-01-24T21:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Omaha.com'}","With new Rumbler sirens, Omaha police aim to really get your attention as they respond to emergencies",http://www.omaha.com/news/crime/with-new-rumbler-sirens-omaha-police-aim-to-really-get/article_42ca004e-66d7-54e6-9190-fa472a15c7e7.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/e0/0e0986e2-5b5c-5db0-9f6c-0056ffe8fcf7/5a68fd20d5fd1.image.jpg?crop=1421%2C1066%2C260%2C0&resize=840%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Omaha.com,rumbler,1
Stuart Berman,"The last thing the world needs is another Fall compilation. The sheer volume of music that Mark E. Smith (and whoever he’s barking orders at) has produced over the past four decades has resulted in so many anthologies and quickie collections that you could build a house out of the jewel cases. But Cherry Red’s new seven-disc Fall box set instantly crushes them all like Godzilla on Bambi. It’s a survey of every single and B-side the Mancunian institution has released since 1978, providing a tidy, linear history of a notoriously unstable band. As with everything about the Fall, however, even this simple strategy is actually a lot more complicated than it appears. Back in 2006, The Guardian ’s Dave Simpson attempted to track down every former member of the Fall, a list that could fill a small town’s phonebook. And there could likely be another compelling in-depth article written about the effort required to put this box set together. The Fall have released over 50 singles to date, and through almost as many labels, some of which are long-defunct. Singles 1978-2016 is the product of a nearly four-year, Indiana Jones -worthy quest, but with the religious artifacts replaced by an even more elusive, holier grail: proper publishing-rights paperwork. So the fact that this box set exists at all is a minor miracle. What’s even more remarkable is the fact that, while listening to these seven discs attentively in one sitting would require you to book a day off from your job, it rarely feels like work. Even after their fleeting late-’80s moment as a Top 40 threat had passed, and the quality of their albums became more of a crap shoot, the Fall remained an intriguingly unpredictable singles band, one whose cantankerous, chaotic reputation belies their economical songcraft and stylistic malleability. Singles 1978-2016 emulates the segregated format of Beggars Banquet’s popular 1990 compilations 458489 A Sides and 458489 B Sides. The box set’s first three discs (which are also available as a separate package) chronologically chart the journey from debut single “Bingo-Master’s Break Out” to last year’s “Wise Ol’ Man,” with each disc loosely representing a distinct phase in their evolution: the minimalist garage-punk origins, the semi-pop era, and the post-millennial free-for-all. The other four discs plot a parallel, circuitous course through the B-sides. (It’s a testament to Smith’s uncommon industriousness that the tracklist here is dramatically different than the Fall’s other career-spanning, multi-disc box set, The Complete Peel Sessions 1978-2004.) Separating the A-sides from B-sides makes a certain amount of sense, providing both an easy entry point into the band’s labyrinthine catalog and a scenic path for more committed listeners to go down. At the same time, with a band like the Fall, the distinction between A-sides and B-sides was often largely arbitrary—a B-side banger like 1981’s “Fantastic Life” could be just as rousing as any lead single from the same era; an A-side rumbler like 1986’s “Living Too Late” could be just as cold and imposing as any oddity tucked on the flipside. From the get-go, the Fall were clearly unlike any other punk band. Sure, the surface sneer of gut-punching early singles like “It’s the New Thing” may have aligned Mark. E. Smith with other Johnny Rotten -come-latelys, but his overstuffed lyric sheets were loaded with contrarian critiques of a punk culture that had become just as conformist and close-minded as the establishment it railed against. The Fall are often classified as post-punk—a movement synonymous with anti-rock experimentation and futurist principles—but in their early years, they were more interested in putting a post-modernist spin on pre-punk sounds. They cultivated mutant strains of country (“Fiery Jack”), 1950s rockabilly (“Lie Dream of a Casino Soul,” which sounds like “Tequila” being subjected to electro-shock therapy), and 1960s garage (“Psycho Mafia,” a showcase for original keyboardist Una Baines’ eerily emotionless, ice-picked organ lines). And even as Smith’s lyrics turned increasingly cryptic, he still trafficked in relatable subjects—football, World War II, over-caffeination—that made him more at home with the factory workers at the local pub than the art-school students at the discotheque. But then, Smith had a peculiar gift for rendering everyday English urbanity as dystopian sci-fi. The clanging “I’m Into C.B.,” for example, begins as a cheeky fetishization of trucker culture, before revealing its narrator as a sad-sack, jobless shut-in who uses his radio for devious prankster purposes—an uncanny prophecy of 21st-century online-trolling. The arrival of guitarist (and Smith’s future wife) Brix in 1983 didn’t so much change the Fall’s sound as embolden it. The haunted-house organ sounds of old were updated to bright synths, the drum-machine tinkering was beefed up into danceable beats, and Smith’s verbal spew was unleashed in more controlled, graceful arcs. And with Brix dropping shout-’em-out pop hooks like cherries on a mud sundae, the band enjoyed a steady six-record run on Beggars Banquet that yielded their most immediate, enduring songs. At the time, they were producing work of such high quality—and at such a high volume—that they could afford to relegate bop-along earworms like “C.R.E.E.P.” and “Oh! Brother” to non-album singles, while punting definitive tracks like “No Bulbs” to stopgap EPs. Up to this point, the Fall’s B-sides form an alternate canon every bit as wonderful and frightening as their headlining tracks, yielding a wealth of alternate-universe indie-rock touchstones (“2nd Dark Age”), hypno-dirge rants (“Repetition”), and eerily prescient premonitions (from the ominous “Auto Tech Pilot”: “I really think this computer thing is getting out of hand!”). Starting in the ’90s, the bloated demands of the CD-single took hold, with remixes, live takes, alternate versions, and even Christmas songs starting to appear. They’re emblematic of an era when the Fall seemed to be settling comfortably into middle age, even after Brix departed (she later rejoined) and the band’s revolving door began to swing more vigorously. It was a decade spent embracing trends (see: the Madchester-grooved “Telephone Thing”); flirting with elegantly sung, string-sweetened middle-brow indie (“Popcorn Double Feature”); mashing up reggae standards (“Why Are People Grudgeful?”); quoting Paul Simon (“15 Ways”); and rewriting “Summertime Blues” wholesale (“F-‘Oldin’ Money”). The lager-sloshing 1999 single “Touch Sensitive” could even pass for a Fatboy Slim jam, a fact reinforced by its festival-ready remix. But after this period of streamlined aesthetic stability, the Fall barreled into the new millennium oscillating violently between accessibility and inscrutability, as if the Y2K bug had bypassed our computers and lodged itself firmly in Mark E. Smith’s brain. On the one hand, the Fall’s later years have seen Smith re-embrace his raw, garage-punk roots, albeit with a more muscular menace. The 2004 single “Theme From Sparta F.C. #2” adheres to his tradition of soccer-stadium-worthy chants, but comes as vicious as a pack of marauding hooligans. “Reformation! (Uncut)” takes aim at the ex-bandmates who abandoned him mid-tour in 2006, wielding its sinister two-note bass riff like a pulse rifle. On the other hand, as his line-up has steadied over the past decade, Smith has been all-too-eager to disembowel his band’s sound—by 2013’s “The Remainderer” and “Amorator!,” the Fall had effectively become an improvisational ensemble, their songs serving as rusted spittoons for Smith’s increasingly slurred, phlegm-soaked invectives. Strange as it is to say about a seven-disc, eight-hour box set, Singles 1978-2016 is not exactly a comprehensive overview of the Fall’s discography. By its very nature, it must exclude the band’s greatest front-to-back album, 1982’s Hex Enduction Hour, which yielded several certified classics (“Hip Priest,” “The Classical”) but no official singles. Likewise, it can’t include essential album cuts (from early rave-up “Industrial Estate” to 2005 bruiser “What About Us?”) that never made it onto seven-inch. But this is still a staggering monument all the same, an elaborately detailed portrait of a shambolic artist whose astonishing productivity, creative restlessness, and utter disdain for the niceties of civil society know no bounds. This is Mark E. Smith’s lawn, and we’re all invited to get the fuck off of it.","This new seven-disc Fall box set surveys every single and B-side the Mancunian institution has released since 1978.

Reuters,"Tsunami alerts were lifted on Tuesday for the U.S. West Coast and western Canada after a magnitude-7.9 earthquake struck in the Gulf of Alaska, sending the state's coastal residents inland to seek shelter from possible tidal waves. In Alaska, people packed into high schools and other evacuation centers after the quake hit shortly after midnight local time (0900 GMT). Officials had warned residents as far south as San Francisco to be ready to evacuate coastal areas but by 5:15 a.m. PST (1315 GMT) the U.S. National Weather Service had lifted all tsunami advisories, watches and warnings for California, Oregon Washington and Alaska. Canadian officials lifted one for coastal British Colombia. In Alaska, residents gathered in shelters on Kodiak Island, the closest land point to the temblor, around 160 miles (250 km) southeast of Chiniak, Alaska, at a depth of 25 km - considered shallow but with broader damage - according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake, which was initially measured at magnitude 8.2. “People are fine,” said Neil Hecht, assistant principal of Kodiak High School, which was sheltering a few hundred people. ""Spirits are high.” Long lines of traffic formed in coastal communities including Homer and Seward, Alaska, residents said on social media. In Homer, a few hundred cars were packed into its high school parking lot. Shawn Biessel, a 32-year-old park ranger, and his mother were in the lot, a few hundred feet above sea level. “It was a really obvious, pretty strong, long quake. A good rumbler,” Biessel said in a phone interview. “It went on for a solid minute and after a while we thought we should get outside.” Police drove through Biessel's neighborhood with flashing lights to alert residents to evacuate, Biessel said. San Francisco briefly warned residents within three blocks of the Pacific Ocean or five blocks of San Francisco Bay to prepare to evacuate. That warning was later lifted. Earthquakes of similar magnitude are not uncommon in Alaska, which is seismically active. The state has recorded 11 tremors with a magnitude of 7 or greater within 373 miles (600 km) of Tuesday's quake over the past century, according to Zachary Reeves, a USGS seismologist in Golden, Colorado. The largest U.S. earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude-9.2 temblor in Alaska in March 1964, causing tidal waves of more than 100 feet (30 m) high that killed 131 people.

By Verena Dobnik / The Associated Press,"NEW YORK (AP) If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
""I've been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance,"" says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the city's hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison.
""Europeanizing"" New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention.
""The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing,"" adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last week's NBC ""Saturday Night Live,"" where a ""Weekend Update"" anchor joked that with the European-style siren, ""You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.""
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city's Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year.

Verena Dobnik - The Associated Press,"NEW YORK - If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the citys soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to whats heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
Ive been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance, says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the citys hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison.
Europeanizing New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention.
The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing, adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last weeks NBC Saturday Night Live, where a Weekend Update anchor joked that with the European-style siren, You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the citys Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex.
At community board meetings, Mount Sinais Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.

Sarah Douglas,"Dominique Lévy and Cheyenne Westphal at Les Trois Rois in Basel, Switzerland. ©SCOTT RUDD Dominique Lévy began her career in the mid-1980s as an intern at Christie’s before moving for four years to Sothebys and then setting out to work as a dealer. She returned to Christies in 1999, recruited by François Pinault, then the companys new owner, to run the first auction house department devoted to private treaty sales. She left Christies in 2003 to start her own advisory service in New York, and, two years later, teamed up with fellow dealer Robert Mnuchin for an eight-year run as partners in L&amp;M Arts. They went their separate ways in 2013, and Lévy opened her own eponymous gallery; then, in 2016, she brought on her current business partner, Brett Gorvy, after poaching him from his post as Christies chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art. With locations in New York, London, Zurich, and Shanghai, Lévy Gorvy gallery now works with artists and estates including Terry Adkins, Pierre Soulages, Dan Colen, and Adrian Piper. Cheyenne Westphal, the German-born chairman of Phillips auction house, started out at Sothebys and worked her way up to worldwide head of contemporary art. Based in London, she became known as a rainmaker. In 2008 she oversaw Damien Hirsts mega-sale of his own artworks, which brought in a whopping $200 million, and in 2015 she was the force behind Sothebys most successful contemporary art auction in Europe, a $204.7 million haul. She joined Phillips last year and has already logged the houses most successful sale ever: a London auction this past March that made $135 million and included a record-smashing $11.9 million painting by Mark Bradford. ARTnews convened with the two women over breakfast at the storied Three Kings Hotel in Basel, Switzerland, during the 49th edition of Art Basel, the worlds most important fair for modern and contemporary artand a significant barometer for the global art market. For Lévy, black coffee and an assortment of fruit; for Westphal, green tea, fruit, and yogurt. ©SCOTT RUDD ARTnews: As women working in the art world, what are the challenges? Dominique Lévy: Can we skip that? ARTnews: At Art Basel yesterday, I was talking with a male dealer, a pleasant conversation, when two men came up. The whole tenor of things changed: there was a fist bump and suddenly I was Cheyenne Westphal: Invisible. Lévy: A boys club exchange. We had lots of those in the booth yesterday. Also, somebody came up to me and said, How does it feel to be a woman gallerist? I said, Do you mean how does it feel to be a gallerist? I cant go into this dichotomy, especially being in a business partnership with a man. You see collectors who come to the booth and prefer to have the final negotiation with a man. But if I go into it, it will prevent me from being who I am and acting naturally, so I decided to go away from woman artist, woman dealer, woman directorit was getting unbearable. I dont feel Im a woman gallerist. Im a gallerist. Westphal : I dont fist bump, I can tell you that. [ Laughs. ] Thats not how we need to greet each other. ARTnews: Cheyenne, youre on the advisory board of the Association of Women in the Arts... Westphal : Yes, I think thats important. When moving through my career, it wasnt the sort of thing I thought of doing as a woman. But it is important for women starting out to see other women at the top of their game. They see that its a possibility, a path they can take. Lévy: But is it part of your identity? Westphal: More than I was aware of. I was at Sothebys for 25 years. When I left, people took the opportunity to tell me thingsa bit like being at your own funeral. It came up quite a bit that I was a role model. I do take it seriously when I speak to younger staff. Lévy: Recently I was asked to do the commencement speech at the Sothebys Institute of Art, and it was a majority of women. All through my speech, there was no part about being a woman. Two of the young students came to me after and said, You didnt talk about what it meant to be a woman! ARTnews: Dominique, the people youve spoken of as your mentorsSimon de Pury, Anthony dOffay, François Pinault... Lévy:... have been men. But my ideas have come from looking at people like Peggy Guggenheim, Paula Cooper, Marian Goodmanall women. My imaginative mentors, the ones who fuel my dreams, are women. Westphal: Thats whats important. And by simply doing what youre doing, you are fulfilling that role. You dont have to talk about it in terms of gender. ARTnews: In terms of the market, in an interview on the Art Basel website, the economist Clare McAndrew said that in 2017 the global art economy grew for the first time since 2014, with a 12 percent rise over 2016. Where do you feel the market is now, after the big May auctions in New York and the first day of Art Basel? Westphal: Phillipss numbers have been going upward strongly, and we had a fantastic beginning to the year. We had our strongest sale in March in London. What I loved about that sale was that we had the ability to curate the 21st century and bring things together because we dont have fixed categories like the other auction houses. There was a fantastic early Matisse that hadnt been seen for almost 100 years, and a Picasso that made $57.8 million; at that same sale, we made world records for Mark Bradford and Rudolf Stingel. The New York May sale seasonit was difficult to take in two weeks of Frieze and then the Rockefeller sales at Christies. It was a difficult season to work. You got people really on, but you had to keep their concentration for a long time. Its draining. But there were a lot of things in May that I thought were interesting. There is a reevaluation of artists who havent been in a particular price category yet. At Phillips, we had a Motherwell painting from 1971, which sold for $12.7 million. Lévy: You also had a Basquiat. Westphal: That painting [ Flexible from 1984, which sold for $45.3 million] came from the Basquiat estate. That was proper auction magicsomething great that doesnt carry a guarantee, that has a really decent estimate, and just went poof! But there were also things that were much more difficult to sell this time around. When you get to the $10 million-plus level, you have to have it right in terms of artists breaking into that level or in terms of the quality of the works. A Martin Kippenberger on offer in the Phillips salesroom in June 2018. COURTESY PHILLIPS ARTnews: An adviser who works with clients in the $50 million-plus stratosphere told me he was surprised there was so little competition. Is it thin at the top? Lévy: I thought last months auctions were a tale of two worlds. You had the sweet spot between $3 million and $6 million... Westphal: Lots of bidding there. Lévy: A ton! That scope was deeper and wider than weve ever seen. Honestly, we dealers in our art fair booths couldnt sell some of these objects at those prices. And then you had what I call the very strange top-tier guarantees. I was surprised to see how little competition there was and how many works went to the guarantor. That makes me, as a dealer, question the whole value of an object. Not the marketthe market is there. As we saw yesterday at Art Basel, its very deep, very healthy. But if an auction house puts a guarantee at $10 million and you have only one bid, at $10 million, what is truly the value of that work of art? It could have been $6 million, for all we know. This is incredibly troubling, and it had a ripple effect at the fair yesterday. People were so tough in their offers. ARTnews: How so? Lévy: There was much less back and forth. There was much more walking away from a deal if they didnt get it at the price they wanted. And the prices being offered were not the prices of the most recent record. They were much more looking at the estimates of 6 to 12 months ago. There were so many Joan Mitchells at the fair, and nobody was really looking at the price of that single painting at Christies [ Blueberry (1969), which sold for a record $16.6 million in May]. They were looking at the market in general. All of the good Mitchells in the fair sold, but they didnt sell at the $16 million levelthey sold where the market was six months ago. I think were really in an intelligent market for the first time in five years. ARTnews: Is that a good place to be? Lévy: Were getting to a place where sellers have to get real. Auction houses have to be much more responsible. They cannot just stuff a guarantee to one person. Flexible was unguaranteed, fresh, and you saw fierce competition. I believe whoever bought it got a fantastic bargain. If there had been less choice that week, that painting would have gone to $60 million. It is one of the top Basquiats in the world. Westphal: What you said about the two tiers is true. And you see this in the day sales, where the sell-through rate is the highest its ever been. Lévy: And by the way, that level is where auction houses make money. Westphal: Youre absolutely right. For Phillips, that $3 million to $6 million level is still our sweet spot. And were seeing a lot of new people. It is very difficult at the top price levels. Sellers expectations are very high. And competition between houses can be fierce. Lévy: The market is confused. When the guarantor ends up buying a Picasso at a Sothebys Rockefeller sale against no competition, you dont really know if they wanted it or not. Westphal: Then you get price explosions in artists, like when Cecily Brown paintings jumped up. After that, the number of Cecily Browns weve been offered... Lévy: Its ridiculous. Westphal: We just go, No, we cant. Of course, we wont say $1.5 million to $2 million anymore. Wed be comfortable probably going up to $2.5 million, but we cant say $6 million. Lévy: Even at $2.5 million, suddenly you have ten of them. And then you go back to a period where Cecily Browns cant sell. Willem de Kooning, Untitled XXI, 1975, was sold by Lévy Gorvy in March. ©THE WILLEM DE KOONING FOUNDATION / ARTISTS RIGHTS SOCIETY (ARS), NEW YORK ARTnews: How is the market different in Asia? Phillips opened a new Hong Kong office last March during the Art Basel fair there, where, Dominique, you and Brett Gorvy sold a $35 million de Kooning painting belonging to Paul Allen, and you opened an office in Shanghai last fall. Westphal: When I first arrived at Phillips, we had a relatively modest team of 18 people in a small office there, and a year later we are in the St. Georges building, on the 14th floor. You come in, and you know youre in Phillips: the space is similar to what we have in London. Our staff has gone to 50, and weve hired extensively across Asia, not just in Hong Kong. In May we had our most successful auction in Hong Kong. Its moving very quickly. In Asia, the desire to collect and the breadth of buying are phenomenal. We cross-market in our sales. We offer design with Western and Asian art, and that works well. We are seeing new bidders in significant numbers. ARTnews: Youve talked about seeing young collectors in their twenties. Westphal: Yes, its crazy! I think Asian buyers are more comfortable at auctionor theyre comfortable if they think they are dealing with a brand. Lévy: Thats what happened with de Kooning. To gain trust for a private sale takes much more work. Payments take [a very long] time, and capital control is an issue. Weve opened, and well continue to grow. We now have a team of six people, and the Asian team makes a difference. You cannot penetrate China or think about going to Korea or elsewhere in Asia without having people on the ground. That is the true investment. Our approach there has been to complement what the auction houses are doing. Were not going there with huge galleries and sending second-tier work by great artists. Weve decided we need to go with an advisory house and form relationships with a small number of relevant collectors, and to bring works of art there to a private showroom. Its an approach thats slightly different and really mirroring and complementing what the auction houses are doing. Westphal: In China taste changes so quickly. Three years ago, it was blue-chip names, maybe reported at slightly lower price points. The range of artists now is extraordinary. In Hong Kong, the opening of the H Queens building [a development that plays home to recently opened spaces for the mega galleries David Zwirner, Hauser &amp; Wirth, and Pace] was quite special. There was a stunning exhibition of collector J. Tomilson Hills Christopher Wool paintings on the ground floor. Then you worked your way up, and gallerists put on either good or very commercial shows. The building was buzzing. Lévy: I wouldnt want to be in that building. To me its such a glitzy, flashy imageit will work for a bit [but] the building feels like a department store, or a VMA award show. Westphal: The level of clients I saw in there was phenomenal. Lévy: I totally agree. It felt a bit like SoHo when it had all the galleries. Its an energy thats important. There were a lot of Asian collectors at the fair yesterday, though less than last year. In rethinking where we are right now in terms of auctions, galleries, and advisers, Asia is a big part of that. But we cant just grow and grow. There has to be some thoughtfulness, and I hope thats what weve learned from the last auctions. Mark Bradford, Helter Skelter, 2007. COURTESY PHILLIPS ARTnews: How are major galleries and auction houses changing? Dominique, you recently hired Andreas Rumbler, who was a chairman at Christies for years, to provide advisory and consulting services to collectors. Lévy: Andreas is a partner for a Swiss entity in Zurich. New York and London [where we have galleries] are all about the artist, the estate, the art. But around the world, we feel that what we are not managing to serve properly is more of a client advisory. We now have that in Asia, and were doing it in Zuricha small, private, beautiful showroom that is more client-centric than art-centric. Westphal: At Phillips, because we want to have a firm position in the 20th and 21st centuries across everything we do, it is important to see what we can do with those categories that really attract buyers in the field. And of course we do private salessorry, Dominique. ARTnews: But it was Dominique who ran the very first private sales department at an auction house. She started it! Lévy: I know! Westphal: We do selling exhibitions. And we work with curators, like [former Brooklyn Museum director] Arnold Lehman, who bring a different element to the way we look and the way we communicate with clients. There really are changes in galleries and auction houses. ARTnews: Lately, some respected art writers and editors have gone to galleries and auction houses to produce content. Lévy: But we are still commercial entities. We have all hired content people, indeed, to share stories and information that make things more meaningful. I dont think its intellectual content. Thats still reserved for museums, research, and good journalism. And I still believe theres a fundamental difference between an auction house and a gallerythank god. Thats why I feel that when Sothebys wants to start representing artists and estates, its very dangerous territory. I dont think they should do itI dont think they can do it. And I think that any artist who would go there would be selling their soul to the devil. Auction houses and galleries are complementary but still very separate. We work with curators, writers, and journalists, but we cannot pretend to be a museum. Westphal: But your shows are often on that level. What you just did in London was phenomenal, with Polke, Lichtenstein, and Gerald Laing. Lévy: Thank you. We try to excel. But in the museum world, there is an amount of research and depth. We can do these shows, and they are meaningful, but its still just two rooms. If it was a museum, it would be a whole floor. Im trying to keep the museum for the museum, because for multiple reasons its becoming harder and harder for museums to mount extraordinary shows. And its becoming easier for us galleries because we can act quickly and our relationships are deep with museums and collectors. ARTnews: Phillips seems to have doubled down on being a specialized auction house. Lévy: Phillips has specializedthis is very important. I think finally Phillips has taken a niche that was always available. Westphal: We are still a relatively small organization, so we have to focus. If we want to be really good in the 20th and 21st centuries, thats what drives it right now. Auctions are importantthats our business, thats our calling card, so a lot of our energy has gone into making every auction better and showing what we can do. Thats why I point to the March salebecause that is the way Id love to be able to show the art of the century. Lévy: The great Peggy Guggenheim model. Westphal: I come from working in big structures, and I know the [pressure to] produce sales every week to keep the beast happy. We dont have that. Lévy: I think you have a market effect today that is enormous. Under the leadership of Ed [CEO Edward Dolman], Phillips is changing in our eyes. We as advisers or dealers or collectors are looking at Phillips in a completely different way. Westphal: We have a niche. We have 30 works in an evening sale and, at any given time, maybe 200 in a day sale. You go into the other houses and you might find 2,000 works for sale in that same period of time. Thats overwhelming. Our size allows us to have one-on-one contact. It also allows us to invest in areas that will give us an edge going forward. We are investing heavily in technology, and its working amazingly well. Henri Matisse, Nu allongé I (Aurore), 1907, which was sold by Phillips earlier this year. COURTESY PHILLIPS ARTnews: Theres a lot of talk about small and mid-tier galleries struggling to survive in the art fair age. In April, David Zwirner suggested that the big galleries should help subsidize smaller ones at fairswhich might be great marketing for him, by the way. Lévy: Yes and no. I thought it looked very patronizing. ARTnews: Do you feel a responsibility to support the art ecosystem? Or are you more laissez-faire like Larry Gagosian, who recently said, I think its a pretty good system from my perspective. Lévy: Its not about supporting the art ecosystem. I feel a deep responsibility to support art, whether its artists I believe in, publications, museum shows, poetry, creative conversation. I dont feel a responsibility to support another gallery. I think that responsibility [falls on] the fairs. I feel that [Art Basel director] Marc Spiegler should stop having all the blue-chip galleries in the center and all the secondary-market and contemporary galleries [elsewhere]. I would like to see a gallery I have never heard of with a great project right in the rotunda, on the main floor. It would excite me! Id like to be next to that gallery! ARTnews: Are there ways in which you operate that are taking away from smaller galleries? Lévy: Absolutely not. Its giving back when we team with Thomas Erben, a tiny gallery, on Senga Nengudi. We changed the relationship with her work and museum shows, and we kept the relationship with Thomas. Now, there are galleries that say to an artist, If you come with me, its me worldwide and only me. Thats counter to my instincts, my core beliefs. I believe an artist should be in many galleries, so as to have many conversations, many dialogues. This idea of being in one gallery and showing in the same spaces, with just different locations, is sinister for artists. If you ask me where Id like to gowhere I think [the whole system] will goits going to be much more fluid and collaborative. Everyone is craving that. Right now, everyone is holding on, but at some point, nobody will have the muscle to hold on. In the next five yearsbecause of the auction houses expanding, technology, globalizationI see much more fluidity. I pray for that, because it will foster collaboration. ARTnews: Cheyenne, do you think Phillips has a responsibility to the ecosystem? Westphal: We do. In auctions you have to be careful what you take in. Its not good for us to have 20 percent of a sale unsold because were taking artists in who cant be sold at auction right now. We have good people at Phillips who focus on that. They have to be close to the market, and close to the artists. We do want to present the best of what is out there. If we do that well, it becomes interesting, because were creating a way for people to experience young art that can be bought easily. We are dealing with a much larger audience. Online bidding means a huge amount in any sale category below $10 million. For Phillips, online registration in 2017 surpassed regular registration, meaning bids on the telephone, absentee bids, and so forth. Eighty percent of our editions sale is presold. If youre on our app, you can buy now. In the last editions sale, we had 1,000 online registrants participate. Lévy: Thats enormous! Westphal: And now that happens in a very fluid way with the auctioneer. Lévy: But we have to keep a difference between the art and the art market. I think the auction houses have a market responsibility. As a gallery, we have a market responsibility to foster and nourish our artists or our estates. I think theres a fine line that we dont talk enough about. The press is generally very focused on the market and mixes galleries and auction houses. But, although we are complementary and our overall responsibility is actually united, our responsibilities are very different. Westphal: I agree. What youre doing with artists and estates is work that demands complete and long-term focus. Lévy: Patience! Westphal: Thats why I dont see that happening at an auction house either, because I know that it takes not just somebody who works with an artist or builds up his exhibition history or relationships with museums over a period of time. Its a different expertise. Lévy: There has to be some mess. I got lost upstairs in Basel and bought an artist I had never even heard of. It was from a gallery I know well, that I go to always. The joy of discoverywe have to keep that! ARTnews: Would you agree or disagree that there are fewer real collectors today, meaning connoisseurs rather than investors? Lévy: Disagree. Westphal: I also disagree. I think were seeing people putting amazing collections together. Lévy: And being excited, engaged. ARTnews: Are they buying with their eyes and not their ears? Lévy: Sometimes, but sometimes both. Theyre both valid. You can buy with your eyes, but when you hear a museum is getting ready for a retrospective, is that a wrong kind of information that prompts you to buy or to commit? We have 90 percent real collectors. I had extraordinary conversations at the booth. They didnt all lead to a sale, but they were fantastic. Westphal: I think 90 percent is high, but I can completely see it when I look at your program. At auction you see a broader [range] of patrons. You see a lot of serious collectors putting collections together, often from younger generations. But we know that we cant take [investment] value out of an art discussion. I look at that myself, in my own collecting. To take that away from anybodys thinking I think is just impossible.

Ed Power,"Album: Everything Is Love Artist: Beyoncé and Jay-Z Label: Tidal Genre: Hip-Hop &amp; Rap Infidelity may be a wrecking ball to the average marriage but for Beyoncé and Jay-Z it turns out to be the ultimate creative inspiration. The tribulations of being a strong black woman with a cheating husband was the fire that lit up Beyoncé ’s extraordinary 2016 album Lemonade while last year’s 4:44 from Jay-Z was one long, anguished mea-culpa – and, not un-coincidentally perhaps, his strongest record in almost a decade. Now the feuding spouses are back together with a collaboration, Everything is Love – surprise released at the conclusion of their joint UK tour and credited to “The Carters” – that brings to a close their state-of-the-martial-union trilogy. Given all the vitriol sloshing about Lemonade especially, the listener could be forgiven for steeling themselves for the worst. So it’s both a relief and also, if we’re being honest, a vague disappointment that Everything Is Love turns out to be a hugs-and-kisses, let’s-be-friends-again affair. It’s a weird, woozy listen – if there’s one thing more uncomfortable than being in the crossfire of a rowing couple, it’s hanging around for the inevitable soppy make-up afterwards, which is essentially what we’re expected to endure here. Crucially, though, Everything Is Love is never saccharine and Beyoncé, especially, emerges as savvy and sardonic – not for one moment hoodwinked by her husband’s mogul charm. The degree to which she bosses the LP – all the best rapping is from her, not Jay-Z – hints strongly that they have reconciled on her terms not his. The big shock, in fact, is how raw and unprocessed Beyoncé sounds. She drops an f-bomb on Nic e – and while we’re open to correction, it is potentially the first time she’s ever delivered an expletive on record. Ironically, she starts off mellower than ever on opener Summer, a languid slow-jam that raises the delicious possibility Jay-Z and Beyoncé have tossed off a playful funk album. “Let’s make love in the summer-time,” croons Bey and you can almost feel the sun on your face and dancing across the surface of your heart-shaped swimming pool. But we’re back on the gnarly streets of mainstream hip hop with single Apes**t, which features two thirds of Atlanta’s Migos and brims with bling brags and references to “Lambos” (hip hop parlance for Lamborghinis). Once again the major eye-opener is Beyoncé, who raps with demon-fury and sings through layers of Autotune so that she sounds less like herself than like a Bey-bot from the far future (a touch credited to Pharrell Williams, producer of two of the nine tracks). On 4:44, Jay Z expressed his eternal regret for running around on Bey and vowed to do better. Here, she comes across mollified but not entirely convinced. “You’re lucky I ain’t kill you when I met that B …,” rhymes Beyoncé on LoveHapp y, referring to the “Becky with the good hair” whom she called out for canoodling with her husband on Lemonade. “All right, all right,” interjects Jay-Z, who has never sounded more hangdog. As well as straying spouses, Everything Is Love takes aim at a multitude of irresistible targets. On Nice, Beyoncé draws a bullseye on fans grumbling about the exclusive release of her records on Jay-Z’s Tidal streaming service. “Patiently waiting for my demise / ‘cause my success can’t be quantified/ If I gave two f**ks about streaming numbers/ would have put Lemonade up on Spotify, ” she declaims, each punch connecting with a crunch. Jay-Z, meanwhile, wants a word with the Grammys, who sent him home empty handed despite nominating him for eight awards for 4:44. “Tell the Grammy’s f**k that 0 for 8 s**t, “he raps on Apes**t. “Have you ever seen the crowd goin’ apes**t ?” The score-settling is offset with humour. Several tracks are essentially exercises in braggadocio – “My great-great-grandchildren already rich/ That’s a lot of brown chi’r’en on your Forbes list,” spits Beyoncé on r’n’b rumbler Boss – but the mic-drops come with a wink and a nudge. As summer surprises go, Everything Is Love thus has it all: wit, anger and a behind-the-curtains peek at the Carter household. The John and Yoko of big league hip hop – we’ll leave it to the listener to work out who is the muse, who the boundary-breaking artist – continue to confound and fascinate.",The Carters review: Everything Is Love brings to a close their state-of-the-martial-union trilogy,2018-06-18T10:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-irish-times', 'name': 'The Irish Times'}","Beyoncé and Jay-Z: ‘Everything Is Love’ – a weird, woozy peek at a superstar marriage",https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/beyonc%C3%A9-and-jay-z-everything-is-love-a-weird-woozy-peek-at-a-superstar-marriage-1.3534578,https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.3534577&origw=1440,the-irish-times,The Irish Times,rumbler,1
johngentile@nospam.punknews.org (John Gentile),"One of Integrity’s greatest contributions to the punk/metal scene was subversion. When hardcore was becoming stale chugga-chugga-chuggas, Integrity released the defiantly metal Systems Overload that featured *gasp* guitar solos. Then, just after that, they released Humanity is the Devil which featured a Side B that was essentially a spoken word ambient track about the nature of humanity itself. Then, after that, they kept the pendulum swinging by releasing tracks that were both straightforward (“Rise,” “Beasts as Gods”) and ones that seemed batshit crazy (the Jonestown sampling “Burning Flesh children to mist,” a cover of Billy Idol’s “Dancing with myself.” ) This was ever apparent with the release of their stellar (or cosmic?) LP Howling, for the Nightmare Shall Consume which featured Integrity mastermind Dwid Hellion bringing his thesis about the human condition to full detail while guitarist Dom Romeo layered solo on top of solo on top of solo until the spiraling ball of an album felt like it was breaking apart at its very seams. So… um… what do you do after that? The general wisdom would be “release a new album, either directly copying the previous one OR release a radically different album.” David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Clash, Crass, Bauhaus, Slayer and many more used both of these options to great success, mind you, so there's no shame in that method. But, ever the black sheep, Integrity have forged the third route. Instead of a following a massive platter with another massive platter, Integrity shoots for the compact. At a mere four tracks clocking in at around 10 minutes, their side of the split seems, dare I say, minimalist in nature. Howling had three tracks nearing or exceeding seven minutes, and the whole release reveled in a certain excess. But here, the two originals, “Scorched Earth,” “Flames of the Immortal” use a Spartan attack, both hitting just about two minutes. Hellion follows up on the theme from the previous album and spends the time detailing just how bad and diseased of an animal humanity is. Interestingly, the concept of the flame is used on both tracks (and maybe even the third) and it is described as a tool of positive annihilation. That is, positive in the sense of “good” and not “total,” though total annihilation seems to be Hellion’s goal. Once again, metal maniac Dom Romeo lays down his 80s guitar solos which touch upon classic thrash, classic NWOBH, and classic hardcore, and we are all that much the better for it. Hellion thrives in a charging attack that is both heavy and rapid, and Romeo brings out the best aspects of both of those traits. The two covers are interesting choices as well. “Sons of Satan” is a revved up metal version of a track originally by Hellion’s noise project Vermapyre, which nicely tags onto the theme proper of the EP. Meanwhile, the cover of G.I.S.M.’s “Document One” cleverly reveals some of the gears behind the band. Integrity has often added wear elements into their songs for effect- creepy animal noises, serial killer confessions- but it appears that concept wasn’t created in a vacuum. G.I.S.M. themselves were a very weird band, what with their seemingly cut and paste lyrics, their conspiracy theories, and the blending of Motley Crue styles with Slayer-ish vocals. Integrity has fun locking the disparate together here and showing just how easy it really is to “break the rules” and how few other artists really take the chance. Romeo also appears to have a blast with these rollercoaster glam-riffs. Integrity’s half of this split supplements their most recent work by both boiling down its core message to two punchy tracks and by showing the garden from which it grew. For their part, Krieg crank out a new tune and reworkings of two older tracks. “Circle of Guilt” is metal rumbler in the classic sense with lumbering riffs, haunting backdrops, and growled lyrics. Coincidentally, vocalist “N” has a distinct vocal resemblance to G.I.S.M.’s Sakevi. “Circle of Guilt” is clearly designed as a fan pleaser in that the band lashes out propulsive riffs while N ominously issues proclamations over the top. Perhaps in contrast to Integrity’s tearing down of genre, Krieg makes the opposite argument by taking Death Metal’s hallmarks and burnishing them to their sharpest sense. The same can be said for the re-working of “This Time I’ll leave you to drown” and the live cut of “The sick winds stir the cold dawn.” This is a death metal band doing death metal in the contemporary sense. The band isn’t afraid of good production and they benefit because of it. There are a lot of tiny details and nuances hidden underneath the bleak crushing, and those tiny ornaments are what keeps the classic style here sounding fresh and veteran, as opposed to stale. That is to say, Krieg know how to stay within a certain style without avoiding cliché. No easy task. This split walks an interesting line. At once, it could be considered an appetizer for newbies as both bands demonstrate a compact serving of their styles across two relatively short sides. But on the other hand, heavy duty fans will find secrets and revelations hidden in the grooves and lyrics if they look hard enough. Both bands deal in the occult, so how amusing is it that revelation can be placed in plain sight? Maybe only the curious will see beyond the initial trappings, and maybe that’s the point.","One of Integrity’s greatest contributions to the punk/metal scene was subversion.

Catherynne M. Valente,"Published in Jan. 2018 (Issue 92) | 4570 words © 2010 by Catherynne M. Valente. Originally published in Ventriloquism, PS Publishing. Reprinted by permission of the author. The difficulties of transporting wine over interstellar distances are manifold. Wine is, after all, like a child. It can bruise. It can suffer trauma—sometimes the poor creature can recover; sometimes it must be locked up in a cellar until it learns to behave itself. Sometimes it is irredeemable. I ask that you greet the seven glasses before you tonight not as simple fermented grapes, but as the living creatures they are, well-brought up, indulged but not coddled, punished when necessary, shyly seeking your approval with clasped hands and slicked hair. After all, they have come so very far for the chance to be loved. Welcome to the first public tasting of Domaine Zhaba. My name is Phylloxera Nanut, and it is the fruit of my family’s vines that sits before you. Please forgive our humble venue—surely we could have wished for something grander than a scorched pre-war orbital platform, but circumstances, and the constant surveillance of Château Marubouzu-Débrouillard and their soldiers have driven us to extremity. Mind the loose electrical panels and pull up a reactor husk—they are inert, I assure you. Spit onto the floor—a few new stains will never be noticed. As every drop about to pass your lips is wholly, thoroughly, enthusiastically illegal, we shall not stand on ceremony. Shall we begin? 2583 Sud-Côtê-du-Golubash (New Danube) The colonial ship Quintessence of Dust first blazed across the skies of Avalokitesvara two hundred years before I was born, under the red stare of Barnard’s Star, our second solar benefactor. Her plasma sails streamed kilometers long, like sheltering wings. Simone Nanut was on that ship. She, alongside a thousand others, looked down on their new home from that great height, the single long, unfathomably wide river that circumscribed the globe, the golden mountains prickled with cobalt alders, the deserts streaked with pink salt. How I remember the southern coast of Golubash; I played there, and dreamed there was a girl on the invisible opposite shore, and that her family, too, made wine and cowered like us in the shadow of the Asociación. My friends, in your university days did you not study the manifests of the first colonials, did you not memorize their weight-limited cargo, verse after verse of spinning wheels, bamboo seeds, lathes, vials of tailored bacteria, as holy writ? Then perhaps you will recall Simone Nanut and her folly: She used her pitiful allotment of cargo to carry the clothes on her back and a tangle of ancient Maribor grapevine, its roots tenderly wrapped and watered. Mad Slovak witch they all thought her, patting those tortured, battered vines into the gritty yellow soil of the Golubash basin. Even the Hyphens were sure the poor things would fail. There were only four of them on all of Avalokitesvara, immensely tall, their watery triune faces catching the old red light of Barnard’s flares, their innumerable arms fanned out around their terribly thin torsos like peacocks’ tails. Not for nothing was the planet named for a Hindu god with eleven faces and a thousand arms. The colonists called them Hyphens for their way of talking, and for the thinness of their bodies. They did not understand then what you must all know now, rolling your eyes behind your sleeves as your hostess relates ancient history, that each of the four Hyphens was a quarter of the world in a single body, that they were a mere outcropping of the vast intelligences which made up the ecology of Avalokitesvara, like one of our thumbs or a pair of lips. Golubash, I knew. To know more than one Hyphen in a lifetime is rare. Officially, the great river is still called New Danube, but eventually my family came to understand, as all families did, that the river was the flesh and blood of Golubash, the fish his-her-its thoughts, the seaweed his-her-its nerves, the banks a kind of thoughtful skin. Simone Nanut put vines down into the body of Golubash. He-She-It bent down very low over Nanut’s hunched little form, arms akimbo, and said to her: “That will not work-take-thrive-bear fruit-last beyond your lifetime.” Yet work-take-thrive they did. Was it a gift to her? Did Golubash make room, between what passes for his-her-its pancreas and what might be called a liver, for foreign vines to catch and hold? Did he, perhaps, love my ancestor in whatever way a Hyphen can love? It is impossible to know, but no other Hyphen has ever allowed Earth-origin flora to flourish, not Heeminspr the high desert, not Julka the archipelago, not Niflamen the soft-spoken polar waste. Not even the northern coast of the river proved gentle to grape. Golubash was generous only to Simone’s farm, and only to the southern bank. The mad red flares of Barnard’s Star flashed often and strange, and the grapes pulsed to its cycles. The rest of the colony contented themselves with the native root-vegetables, something like crystalline rutabagas filled with custard, and the teeming rock-geese whose hearts in those barnacled chests tasted of beef and sugar. • • • • In your glass is an ’83 vintage of that hybrid vine, a year which should be famous, would be, if not for rampant fear and avarice. Born on Earth, matured in Golubash. It is 98% Cabernet, allowing for mineral compounds generated in the digestive tract of the Golubash river. Note its rich, garnet-like color, the gravitas of its presence in the glass, the luscious, rolling flavors of blackberry, cherry, peppercorn, and chocolate, the subtle, airy notes of fresh straw and iron. At the back of your tongue, you will detect a last whisper of brine and clarygrass. The will of Simone Nanut swirls in your glass, resolute-unbroken-unmoveable-stone. 2503 Abbaye de St. CIR, Tranquilité, Neuf-Abymes Of course, the 2683 vintage, along with all others originating on Avalokitesvara, were immediately declared not only contraband but biohazard by the Asociación de la Pureza del Vino, whose chairman was and is a scion of the Marubouzu clan. The Asociación has never peeked out of the pockets of those fabled, hoary Hokkaido vineyards. When Château Débrouillard shocked the wine world, then relatively small, by allowing their ancient vines to be grafted with Japanese stock a few years before the first of Salvatore Yuuhi’s gates went online, an entity was created whose tangled, ugly tendrils even a Hyphen would call gargantuan. Nor were we alone in our ban. Even before the first colony on Avalokitesvara, the lunar city of St. Clair-in-Repose, a Catholic sanctuary, had been nourishing its own strange vines for a century. In great glass domes, in a mist of temperature and light control, a cloister of monks, led by Fratre Sebastién Perdue, reared priceless Pinot vines and heady Malbecs, their leaves unfurling green and glossy in the pale blue light of the planet that bore them. But monks are perverse, and none more so than Perdue. In his youth, he was content with the classic vines, gloried in the precision of the wines he could coax from them. But in his middle age, he committed two sins. The first involved a young woman from Hipparchus, the second was to cut their orthodox grapes with Tsuki-Bellas, the odd, hard little berries that sprang up from the lunar dust wherever our leashed bacteria had been turned loose in order to make passable farmland as though they had been waiting, all that time, for a long drink of rhizomes. Their flavor is somewhere between a blueberry and a truffle, and since genetic sequencing proved it to be within the grape family, the monks of St. Clair deemed it a radical source of heretofore unknown wonders. Hipparchus was a farming village where Tsuki-Bellas grew fierce and thick. It does not do to dwell on Brother Sebastién’s motives. What followed would be repeated in more varied and bloodier fashions two hundred years hence. Well do I know the song. For Château Marubouzu-Débrouillard and her pet Asociación had partnered with the Coquil-Grollë Corporation in order to transport their wines from Earth to orbiting cities and lunar clusters. Coquil-Grollë, now entirely swallowed by Château M-D, was at the time a soda company with vast holdings in other foodstuffs, but the tremendous weight restrictions involved in transporting unaltered liquid over interlunar space made strange bedfellows. The precious M-D wines could not be dehydrated and reconstituted—no child can withstand such sadism. Therefore, foul papers were signed with what was arguably the biggest business entity in existence, and though it must have bruised the rarified egos of the children of Hokkaido and Burgundy, they allowed their shy, fragile wines to be shipped alongside Super-Cola-nade! and Bloo Bomb. The extraordinary tariffs they paid allowed Coquil-Grollë to deliver their confections throughout the bustling submundal sphere. The Asociación writ stated that adulterated wines could, at best, be categorized as fruit-wines, silly dessert concoctions that no vintner would take seriously, like apple-melon-kiwi wine from a foil-sac. Not only that, but no tariffs had been paid on this wine, and therefore Abbé St. Clair could not export it, even to other lunar cities. It was granted that perhaps, if taxes of a certain (wildly illegal) percentage were applied to the price of such wines, it might be possible to allow the monks to sell their vintages to those who came bodily to St. Clair, but transporting it to Earth was out of the question at any price, as foreign insects might be introduced into the delicate home terroir. No competition with the house of Débrouillard could be broached, on that world or any other. Though in general, wine resides in that lofty category of goods which increase in demand as they increase in price, the lockdown of Abbé St. Clair effectively isolated the winery, and their products simply could not be had—whenever a bottle was purchased, a new Asociación tax would be introduced, and soon there was no possible path to profit for Perdue and his brothers. Past a certain point, economics became irrelevant—there was not enough money anywhere to buy such a bottle. Have these taxes been lifted? You know they have not, sirs. But Domaine Zhaba seized the ruin of Abbé St. Clair in 2916, and their cellars, neglected, filthy, simultaneously worthless and beyond price, came into our tender possession. What sparks red and black in the erratic light of the station status screens is the last vintage personally crafted by Fratre Sebastién Perdue. It is 70% Pinot Noir, 15% Malbec, and 15% forbidden, delicate Tsuki-Bella. To allow even a drop of this to pass your lips anywhere but under the Earthlit domes of St. Clair-in-Repose is a criminal act. I know you will keep this in mind as you savor the taste of corporate sin. It is lighter on its feet than the Côté-du-Golubash, sapphire sparking in the depths of its dark color, a laughing, lascivious blend of raspberry, chestnut, tobacco, and clove. You can detect the criminal fruit—ah, there it is, madam, you have it!—in the mid-range, the tartness of blueberry and the ashen loam of mushroom. A clean, almost soapy waft of green coffee bean blows throughout. I would not insult it by calling it delicious—it is profound, unforgiving, and ultimately, unforgiven. 2790 Domaine Zhaba, Clos du Saleeng-Carolz, Cuvée Cheval You must forgive me, madam. My pour is not what it once was. If only it had been my other arm I left on the ochre fields of Centauri B! I have never quite adjusted to being suddenly and irrevocably left-handed. I was fond of that arm—I bit my nails to the quick; it had three moles and a little round birthmark, like a drop of spilled syrah. Shall we toast to old friends? In the war they used to say: Go, lose your arm. You can still pour. But if you let them take your tongue, you might as well die here. By the time Simone Nanut and her brood, both human and grape, were flourishing, the Yuuhi gates were already bustling with activity. Though the space between gates was vast, it was not so vast as the spaces between stars. Everything depended on them, colonization, communication, and of course, shipping. Have any of you seen a Yuuhi gate? I imagine not, they are considered obsolete now, and we took out so many of them during the war. They still hang in space like industrial mandalas, titanium and bone—in those days an organic component was necessary, if unsavory, and we never knew whose marrow slowly yellowed to calcified husks in the vacuum. The pylons bristled with oblong steel cubes and arcs of golden filament shot across the tain like violin bows—all the gold of the world commandeered by Salvatore Yuuhi and his grand plan. How many wedding rings hurled us all into the stars? I suppose one or two of them might still be functional. I suppose one or two of them might still be used by poor souls forced underground, if they carried contraband, if they wished not to be seen. The 2790 is a pre-war vintage, but only just. The Asociación de la Pureza del Vino, little more than a paper sack Château Marubouzu-Debrouillard pulled over its head, had stationed... well, they never called them soldiers, nor warships, but they were not there to sample the wine. Every wine-producing region from Luna to the hydroponic orbital agri-communes found itself graced with inspectors and customs officials who wore no uniform but the curling M-D seal on their breasts. Every Yuuhi gate was patrolled by armed ships bearing the APV crest. It wasn’t really necessary. Virtually all shipping was conducted under the aegis of the Coquil-Grollë Corporation, so fat and clotted with tariffs and taxes that it alone could afford to carry whatever a heart might desire through empty space. There were outposts where chaplains used Super Cola-nade! in the Eucharist, so great was their influence. Governments rented space in their holds to deliver diplomatic envoys, corn, rice, even mail, when soy-paper letters sent via Yuuhi became terribly fashionable in the middle of the century. You simply could not get anything if C-G did not sell it to you, and the only wine they sold was Marubouzu-Débrouillard. I am not a mean woman. I will grant that though they boasted an extraordinary monopoly, the Debrouillard wines were and are of exceptional quality. Their pedigrees will not allow them to be otherwise. But you must see it from where we stand. I was born on Avalokitesvara and never saw Earth till the war. They were forcing foreign, I daresay alien liquors onto us when all we wished to do was to drink from the land which bore us, from Golubash, who hovered over our houses like an old radio tower, fretting and wringing his-her-its hundred hands. Saleeng-Carolz was a bunker. It looked like a pleasant cloister, with lovely vines draping the walls and a pretty crystal dome over quaint refectories and huts. It had to. The Asociación inspectors would never let us set up barracks right before their eyes. I say us, but truly I was not more than a child. I played with Golubash—with the quicksalmon and the riverweed that were no less him than the gargantuan thin man who watched Simone Nanut plant her vines three centuries past and helped my uncles pile up the bricks of Saleeng-Carolz. Hyphens do not die, any more than continents do. We made weapons and stored wine in our bunker. Bayonets at first, and simple rifles, later compressed-plasma engines and rumblers. Every other barrel contained guns. We might have been caught so easily, but by then, everything on Avalokitesvara was problematic in the view of the Asociación. The grapes were tainted, not even entirely vegetable matter, grown in living Golubash. In some odd sense, they were not even grown, but birthed, springing from his-her-its living flesh. The barrels, too, were suspect, and none more so than the barrels of Saleeng-Carolz. Until the APV inspectors arrived, we hewed to tradition. Our barrels were solid cobalt alder, re-cedar, and oakberry. Strange to look at for an APV man, certainly, gleaming deep blue or striped red and black, or pure white. And of course they were not really wood at all, but the fibrous musculature of Golubash, ersatz, loving wombs. They howled biohazard, but we smacked our lips in the flare-light, savoring the cords of smoke and apple and blood the barrels pushed through our wine. But in Saleeng-Carolz, my uncle, Grel Nanut, tried something new. What could be said to be Golubash’s liver was a vast flock of shaggy horses—not truly horses, but something four-legged and hoofed and tailed that was reasonably like a horse—that ran and snorted on the open prairie beyond the town of Nanut. They were essentially hollow, no organs to speak of, constantly taking in grass and air and soil and fruit and fish and water and purifying it before passing it industriously back into the ecology of Golubash. Uncle Grel was probably closer to Golubash than any of us. He spent days talking with the tall, three-faced creature the APV still thought of as independent from the river. He even began to hyphenate his sentences, a source of great amusement. We know now that he was learning. About horses, about spores and diffusion, about the life-cycle of a Hyphen, but then we just thought Grel was in love. Grel first thought of it, and secured permission from Golubash, who bent his ponderous head and gave his assent-blessing-encouragement-trepidation-confidence. He began to bring the horses within the walls of Saleeng-Carolz, and let them drink the wine deep, instructing them to hold it close for years on end. In this way, the rest of the barrels were left free for weapons. • • • • This is the first wine closed up inside the horses of Golubash: 60% Cabernet, 20% Syrah, 15% Tempranillo, 5% Petit Verdot. It is specifically banned by every planet under APV control, and possession is punishable by death. The excuse? Intolerable biological contamination. This is a wine that swallows light. Its color is deep and opaque, mysterious, almost black, the shadows of closed space. Revel in the dance of plum, almond skin, currant, pomegranate. The musty spike of nutmeg, the rich, buttery brightness of equine blood and the warm, obscene swell of leather. The last of the pre-war wines—your execution in a glass. 2795 Domaine Zhaba, White Tara, Bas-Lequat Our only white of the evening, the Bas-Lequat is an unusual blend, predominately Chardonnay with sprinklings of Tsuki-Bella and Riesling, pale as the moon where it ripened. White Tara is the second moon of Avalokitesvara, fully within the orbit of enormous Green Tara. Marubouzu-Débrouillard chose it carefully for their first attack. My mother died there, defending the alder barrels. My sister lost her legs. Domaine Zhaba had committed the cardinal sin of becoming popular, and that could not be allowed. We were not poor monks on an isolated moon, orbiting planet-bound plebeians. Avalokitesvara has four healthy moons and dwells comfortably in a system of three habitable planets, huge new worlds thirsty for rich things, and nowhere else could wine grapes grow. For a while Barnarders had been eager to have wine from home, but as generations passed and home became Barnard’s System, the wines of Domaine Zhaba were in demand at every table, and we needed no glittering Yuuhi gates to supply them. The APV could and did tax exports, and so we skirted the law as best we could. For ten years before the war began, Domaine Zhaba wines were given out freely, as “personal” gifts, untaxable, untouchable. Then the inspectors descended, and stamped all products with their little Prohibido seal, and, well, one cannot give biohazards as birthday presents. The whole thing is preposterous. If anything, Earth-origin foodstuffs are the hazards in Barnard’s System. The Hyphens have always been hostile to them; offworld crops give them a kind of indigestion that manifests in earthquakes and thunderstorms. The Marubouzu corporals told us we could not eat or drink the things that grew on our own land, because of possible alien contagion! We could only order approved substances from the benevolent, carbonated bosom of Coquil-Grollë, which is Château Marubouzu-Débrouillard, which is the Asociación de la Pureza del Vino, and anything we liked would be delivered to us all the way from home, with a bow on it. The lunar winery on White Tara exploded into the night sky at 3:17 a.m. on the first of Julka, 2795. My mother was testing the barrels—no wild ponies on White Tara. Her bones vaporized before she even understood the magnitude of what had happened. The aerial bombing, both lunar and terrestrial, continued past dawn. I huddled in the Bas-Lequat cellar, and even there I could hear the screaming of Golubash, and Julka, and Heeminspr, and poor, gentle Niflamen, as the APV incinerated our world. • • • • Two weeks later, Uncle Grel’s rumblers ignited our first Yuuhi gate. • • • • The color is almost like water, isn’t it? Like tears. A ripple of red pear and butterscotch slides over green herbs and honey-wax. In the low range, you can detect the delicate dust of blueberry pollen, and beneath that, the smallest suggestion of crisp lunar snow, sweet, cold, and vanished. 2807 Domaine Zhaba, Grelport, Hul-Nairob Did you know, almost a thousand years ago, the wineries in Old France were nearly wiped out? A secret war of soil came close to annihilating the entire apparatus of wine-making in the grand, venerable valleys of the old world. But no blanketing fire was at fault, no shipping dispute. Only a tiny insect: Daktulosphaira Vitifoliae Phylloxera. My namesake. I was named to be the tiny thing that ate at the roots of the broken, ugly, ancient machinery of Marubouzu. I have done my best. For a while, the French believed that burying a live toad beneath the vines would cure the blight. This was tragically silly, but hence Simone Nanut drew her title: zhaba, old Slovak for toad. We are the mites that brought down gods, and we are the cure, warty and bruised though we may be. When my uncle Grel was a boy, he went fishing in Golubash. Like a child in a fairy tale, he caught a great green fish, with golden scales, and when he pulled it into his little boat, it spoke to him. Well, nothing so unusual about that. Golubash can speak as easily from his fish-bodies as from his tall-body. The fish said: “I am lonely-worried-afraid-expectant-in-need-of-comfort-lost-searching-hungry. Help-hold-carry me.” After the Bas-Lequat attack, Golubash boiled, the vines burned, even Golubash’s tall-body was scorched and blistered—but not broken, not wholly. Vineyards take lifetimes to replace, but Golubash is gentle, and they will return, slowly, surely. So Julka, so Heeminspr, so kind Niflamen. The burnt world will flare gold again. Grel knew this, and he sorrowed that he would never see it. My uncle took one of the great creature’s many hands. He made a promise—we could not hear him then, but you must all now know what he did, the vengeance of Domaine Zhaba. The Yuuhi gates went one after another. We became terribly inventive—I could still, with my one arm, assemble a rumbler from the junk of this very platform. We tried to avoid Barnard’s Gate; we did not want to cut ourselves off in our need to defend those worlds against marauding vintners with soda-labels on their jumpsuits. But in the end, that, too, went blazing into the sky, gold filaments sizzling. We were alone. We didn’t win; we could never win. But we ended interstellar travel for fifty years, until the new ships with internal Yuuhi-drives circumvented the need for the lost gates. And much passes in fifty years, on a dozen worlds, when the mail can’t be delivered. They are not defeated, but they are... humbled. An M-D cruiser trailed me here. I lost her when I used the last gate-pair, but now my cousins will have to blow that gate, or else those soda-sipping bastards will know our methods. No matter. It was worth it, to bring our wines to you, in this place, in this time, finally, to open our stores as a real winery, free of them, free of all. • • • • This is a port-wine, the last of our tastings tonight. The vineyards that bore the Syrah and Grenache in your cups are wonderful, long streaks of soil on the edges of a bridge that spans the Golubash, a thousand kilometers long. There is a city on that bridge, and below it, where a chain of linked docks cross the water. The maps call it Longbridge; we call it Grelport. Uncle Grel will never come home. He went through Barnard’s Gate just before we detonated—a puff of sparkling red and he was gone. Home, to Earth, to deliver-safeguard-disseminate-help-hold-carry his cargo. A little spore, not much more than a few cells scraped off a blade of clarygrass on Golubash’s back. But it was enough. Note the luscious ruby-caramel color, the nose of walnut and roasted peach. This is pure Avalokitesvara, unregulated, stored in Golubash’s horses, grown in the ports floating on his-her-its spinal fluid, rich with the flavors of home. They used to say wine was a living thing—but it was only a figure of speech, a way of describing liquid with changeable qualities. This wine is truly alive, every drop, it has a name, a history, brothers and sisters, blood and lymph. Do not draw away—this should not repulse you. Life, after all, is sweet; lift your glasses, taste the roving currents of sunshine and custard, salt skin and pecan, truffle and caramelized onion. Imagine, with your fingers grazing these fragile stems, Simone Nanut, standing at the threshold of her colonial ship, the Finnish desert stretching out behind her, white and flat, strewn with debris. In her ample arms is that gnarled vine, its roots wrapped with such love. Imagine Sebastién Perdue, tasting a Tsuki-Bella for the first time, on the tongue of his Hipparchan lady. Imagine my Uncle Grel, speeding alone in the dark towards his ancestral home, with a few brief green cells in his hand. Wine is a story, every glass. A history, an elegy. To drink is to hear the story, to spit is to consider it, to hold the bottle close to your chest is to accept it, to let yourself become part of it. Thank you for becoming part of my family’s story. • • • • I will leave you now. My assistant will complete any transactions you wish to initiate. Even in these late days, it is vital to stay ahead of them, despite all. They will always have more money, more ships, more bile. Perhaps a day will come when we can toast you in the light, in a grand palace, with the flares of Barnard’s Star glittering in cut crystal goblets. For now, there is the light of the exit hatch, dusty glass tankards, and my wrinkled old hand to my heart. A price list is posted in the med lab. • • • • And should any of you turn Earthwards in your lovely new ships, take a bottle to the extremely tall young lady-chap-entity living-growing-invading-devouring-putting down roots in the Loire Valley. I think he-she-it would enjoy a family visit. Enjoyed this story?

webdesk@voanews.com (Associated Press),"NEW YORK  If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
Ive been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance, says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the city's hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison. 
Europeanizing New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention. 
The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing, adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last week's NBC Saturday Night Live, where a Weekend Update anchor joked that with the European-style siren, You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city's Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex. 
At community board meetings, Mount Sinai's Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.
 People hated them all, Davis said, but the `high-low' was least intrusive. It didn't have that piercing sound.
Davis, a 40-year EMS veteran who suffers from hearing damage that he blames on repeated exposure to sirens, said the change was simple and cost effective: All it took was reprogramming the electronic box in each vehicle, which comes preloaded with seven different sounds with names such as Wail, Yelp and Piercer. 
In fact, many ambulances, fire trucks and police cars are equipped with alternate sirens and horns that they can employ in certain situations, such as in traffic when cars and pedestrians just won't get out of the way. They include short blips and the Rumbler low-frequency, vibrating siren aimed at motorists who may otherwise be unable to hear higher frequencies.
For some Manhattanites, any change in the city's daily siren song would be welcomed.
I always have to cover my ears with my hands when a siren-blaring ambulance passes, says Louise Belulovich, a Manhattan attorney. If I'm carrying packages and unable to, then what is an annoying experience becomes a painful one.''
But Linda Sachs, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side who lives near one of the Mount Sinai hospitals that uses the new European siren, doesn't think the change is for the good. She prefers the old New York standard.
The old sirens never woke me up, but these make me shudder, Sachs says, adding that she understands city lawmakers are attempting to do something about noise pollution. But the old sound wasn't as obnoxious.","If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations — WAAAAAhhhhhhh — would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on th…",2019-02-27T00:09:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Voanews.com'}","Noise-weary New York Ponders a Gentler, European-style Siren",https://www.voanews.com/a/noise-weary-new-york-ponders-a-gentler-european-style-siren-/4805506.html,https://gdb.voanews.com/A9298A60-E97A-4EA4-8CE0-D3EC178A6167_w1200_r1_s.jpg,,Voanews.com,rumbler,1

Manoj Dattatrye More,"PCMC Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar Shravan Hardikar The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) administration has faced controversies over road projects and awarding contracts for garbage collection. Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar sets the record straight in an interview to The Indian Express. A couple of months ago, there were allegations of irregularities in road contracts worth Rs 425 crore. The Chief Minister’s Office had also sought a report in the matter. Has the controversy blown over? There was no controversy whatsoever. In fact, we had saved Rs 91 crore while awarding the contract. The tenders were accepted below the estimated price and not above as was misunderstood by certain quarters. Everything was fair and legal. We have explained the matter in detail to the CM’s office. There has been no communication from them after that. There has been another controversy over award of tenders of garbage collection to two agencies. What is your response to that? The civic administration had picked two agencies to collect the city’s garbage and carry it to the Moshi garbage depot. However, the opposition wanted more than two agencies as they felt two agencies will not be able to manage. The earlier standing committee had given the approval for the two firms. However, the new standing committee has scrapped the proposal and recommended appointment of four agencies. The issue will now go before the civic general body meeting. Does this mean that the administration’s proposal was not acceptable to the corporators? We are in favour of big players doing the job. We feel the smaller players do not have the wherewithal or the capacity to do the job. The smaller players are neither organised nor systematic. For instance, the smaller players have been found to be trampling upon norms when it comes to paying minimum wages to the workers, which is not the case when it comes to bigger players. Anyway, we have gone for financial appraisal by a government expert in this matter. During Shrikar Pardeshi’s tenure Sarathi helpline was a big hit. These days, local residents grumble that their grievances are not being redressed. Why is your administration neglecting Sarathi? It’s not true. In fact, Sarathi continues to get good response. Every month, on an average, we get 8,000 complaints. Also, most of the complaints are being re-opened. Complaints have been closed, with or without solution. Sometimes the complaints are closed because they need long-term solution. For instance, if a resident demands the construction of a road, there is a process to be followed, like acquisition of land, which takes time. Therefore, the complaints are closed, but they are closed temporarily. Once we are in a position to construct the road, the complaint will be re-opened. Indiscriminately placed drainage chambers or storm water drains on city’s road are proving dangerous for road users. Recently a yoga teacher fell unconscious after her cycle hit a drainage chamber, which did not align with the surface of the road. Why is your road department doing such shoddy work? Instructions have been given to the officials concerned to ensure that the drainage chamber covers are aligned with the surface of the road and that they do not cause accidents. The PCMC administration has come up with a parking policy. But it seems to be applicable only to highways and bigger roads, not to internal roads in the suburbs. Your take on this? We are implementing the parking policy in a phase-wise manner. In a city which has had no parking policy, we feel it will take time for citizens to accept it. After we implement it on highways passing through the city and other key roads, it will be implemented on internal roads as well. Your administration is accused by Pune residents of ignoring road safety. A nine-year-old boy died on the Gurav Pimple-Nashik Phata Road and a fortnight later a youth was killed in the same area. Vehicles race at break-neck speed. Residents allege that the PCMC administration has not put in place any safety mechanism despite repeated requests. I have directed officials to conduct safety audit on key roads and devise ways to put a safety mechanism in place. It will be done on the Gurav Pimple-Nashik Phata Road as well as on other roads in the city. Speed-breakers continue to pose a threat to road users, especially two-wheeler riders. But PCMC officials seem to be least concerned about the danger as they go about setting up speed-breakers across the city. We are looking at the option of rumbler strips wherever possible. This aspect is being studied.

"Nashville Tennessean, Mary Hance, Nashville Tennessean","Last Slide Next Slide Dollywood's Drop Line opened in May. (Photo: Dollywood / Curtis Hilbun) Treating the family to a theme park vacation can add up to big bucks. But there are deals out there that can throttle down the cost of these memory-making thrill and chill experiences. I have checked with the parks that are within a fairly easy three- or four-hour drive from Nashville to identify easy ways to get in cheaper this season. Buying tickets online instead of in person can sometimes save, and some of the parks have special offers such as combo deals, second-day discounts and other promotions, like showing a Coke or Pepsi product at the gate. These are things you need to know about in advance, because there is no point in overpaying for this summer fun if you don't have to!

VERENA DOBNIK,"NEW YORK If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations WAAAAAhhhhhhh would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on the streets of London and Paris WEE-oww-WEE-oww-WEE-oww.
Their reasons for the switch: The European-style siren is less shrill and annoying and contributes less to noise pollution.
""I've been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise a nuisance,"" says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
Noise is consistently among the most frequent complaints to the city's hotline, with many calls about the loud sirens that blare 24/7, wake people from their slumber and cause dogs to howl in unison.
""Europeanizing"" New York sirens would not change the decibel level still topping out at roughly 118 but would lower the frequency and thus make the sirens less shrill but still ear-catching enough to grab attention.
""The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing,"" adds co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.
If approved in a council vote which has yet to be scheduled the legislation would require sirens on all emergency vehicles to transition within a two-year period.
Buzz about the bill even made it to last week's NBC ""Saturday Night Live,"" where a ""Weekend Update"" anchor joked that with the European-style siren, ""You can spend your ride in the ambulance pretending you have universal health care.""
City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city's Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex.
At community board meetings, Mount Sinai's Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.
""People hated them all,"" Davis said, ""but the 'high-low' was least intrusive. It didn't have that piercing sound.""
Davis, a 40-year EMS veteran who suffers from hearing damage that he blames on repeated exposure to sirens, said the change was simple and cost effective: All it took was reprogramming the electronic box in each vehicle, which comes preloaded with seven different sounds with names such as ""Wail,"" ''Yelp"" and ""Piercer.""
In fact, many ambulances, fire trucks and police cars are equipped with alternate sirens and horns that they can employ in certain situations, such as in traffic when cars and pedestrians just won't get out of the way. They include short blips and the ""Rumbler"" low-frequency, vibrating siren aimed at motorists who may otherwise be unable to hear higher frequencies.
For some Manhattanites, any change in the city's daily siren song would be welcomed.
""I always have to cover my ears with my hands when a siren-blaring ambulance passes,"" says Louise Belulovich, a Manhattan attorney. ""If I'm carrying packages and unable to, then what is an annoying experience becomes a painful one.""
But Linda Sachs, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side who lives near one of the Mount Sinai hospitals that uses the new European siren, doesn't think the change is for the good. She prefers the old New York standard.
""The old sirens never woke me up, but these make me shudder,"" Sachs says, adding that she understands city lawmakers are attempting to do something about noise pollution. ""But the old sound wasn't as obnoxious.""","If two New York City lawmakers get their way, the long, droning siren from police cars, fire trucks and ambulances that has been part of the city's soundtrack for generations — WAAAAAhhhhhhh — would be replaced by a high-low wail similar to what's heard on th…",2019-02-26T06:10:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Startribune.com'}","Noise-weary New York ponders a gentler, European-style siren",http://www.startribune.com/noise-weary-new-york-ponders-a-gentler-european-style-siren/506365122/,http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1551133584,,Startribune.com,rumbler,1
johngentile@nospam.punknews.org (John Gentile),"WE COME TO DO DAMAGE Whew! Whew! Wheeeewwww weeeeeeeeee!!!!! Yowza. I don’t even need to say it, but 2017 was a year of tumult in the US of A, people. Man! To that end, it is said that conflict and turmoil generates great art, and for 2017, that proposition held true. There were a lot of great albums and a LOT of awesome shows this year. And I tried to do my share in contribution. In 2016, I said I was going to swing for the the fences in 2017 and I really did give it my best. After two years of work, I was able to release the long lost, unreleased Flames album from 1980. This was a really neat, very weird record that I found in the discount bin at a used record store! In the summer, I threw my first ever concert which was basically my dream bill. World Inferno, Posers, Crazy and the Brains, and Pushin’ It 2 the Limit kicked out amazing sets, Adam and I wore tuxedos, we played the Punknews trivia game live, and even gave out goodie bags! WOWIE! Through my record label, I put out SIX different mixtapes and I was pretty proud of each of them. Also, Dom Davi of Tsunami Bomb interviewed me about my first, my favorite and my least favorite show ever on his cool podcast. Journalism wise, I did one of my most extensive interviews ever- I spoke to that punk champion Jello Biafra about what makes him tick! (FYI- if you want the real deal in punk rock, Jello is THE MAN). I interviewed Osamu of Sticks and Stones about moving from Japan and starting a punk band with Jack Terricloth. Buzz Osborne made a connection between science and religion. John Joseph told me about A LOT of things. I got to interview the Coathangers and they are now one of my favorite bands of all time. And so, without further adieu and forgiving my long winded intro, let’s talk about my favorite jams of 2017!!!! Thee Top Twenty LPs of 2017 (Non-Melvins Division) Cleopatra The original space rocker returns to earth with a potent message for us all. Nik Turner, that trans-dimnesional weirdo, ain't gettin' any younger, so, in is infinite LSD-drenched wisdom, he takes a somewhat unexpected turn, looks inward, and shares with us the secrets to life. Turner has done it all and seen it all, and if there's one guy to listen to, it's this astral titan... comforting that he reflects, ""somehow it will be alright."" HOLY SHIT! This album was so good that it caused my entire head to explode and ricochet throughout the cosmos. My flailing body had to hire paradaemons to warp throughout the galaxies in order to re-collect my brain atoms and reassemble my consciousness. Listen, it's one thing for a band to put out an album that completely changes the game ( For Those Who Fear Tomorrow ). But then, it's an entirely different thing for that same band to put out an album that just completely burns away everything that came before it ( Humanity is the Devil ). BUT THEN, it's a whole other thing for that same band to put out an album that goes to the next level from that previous next level and puts out what might be their very best LP (a double/triple one at that!), some 30 odd years into their career!!!! Dom Romeo thrashes on his guitar, layering fractured solo on top of fractured solo. Josh Brettell slams the skins like Lombardo on speed. Meanwhile, Integ mastermind/madman Dwid Hellion opens a vortex into a seance being held by artist Francis Bacon, pulls him up into the multi-verse, drags him throughout time like a cacodaemon-ed Jacob Marley, and forces him, throughout the aeons, to bear witness to humanity's perpetual, unending fall from grace, time and time and time again!!! HOLY SHIT! HOLY SHIIIIT!!! HOLEEEEEEEEEEEY SHEEEEEEEEEEE----- *Brain explodes for a second time* Thee Top Ten Singles/EPs of 2017 (Non-Melvins Division) The Dwarves are going to their extremes- pure pop perfection and hella herculean hardcore. Julio, which serves as a precursor to their upcoming album, proves that they have mastered both forms like no other band before them, and to that end, they are interested in elevating both styles from chewing gum to food for thought. Fewer and fewer bands are willing to stray outside the norm these days and in these times, the Dwarves are proving themselves as fearless as they have ever been. Thee Top Five Melvins Releases of 2017 (Melvins Division) Joyful Noise The greatest drummer in modern rock cuts a 107 second heavy rumbler that slithers like Sabbath and swaggers like Judas Priest. Also, it is literally pressed into an actual cymbal, so you can both play it and play it. Genius. 4. The Melvins: Steven McDonald Amphetamine Reptile Finally completing their KISS inspired quadrilogy, the Melvs push newest bassist, Steve Mcdonald of Redd Kross/OFF! and let him do his thang and, apparently, his thang his busting out KICK ASS rockage. Famously a fan of the history of Rock n Roll, Stevie nods to AM pop, Cheap Trick, Southern Boogie Woogie, and quite tastily, the nascent stage of west coast punk rock. This release is the band just having a ball and McDonald's inherently likable personality shines through- he's grinning along with the rest of us and the fun is infectious. 1. Melvins : A Walk with Love &amp; Death Perhaps tired of hearing that Melvins albums are ""Weird,"" Buzz Osborne often likes to throw out the nugget ""I don't think what we do is that weird."" Well, that being said, this double (!) record IS weird. Or, at least the second half. For the Love Portion, the band turns in the avant-garde soundtrack to an unreleased movie. One part Throbbing Gristle, one part pure noise, one part collage, the record is as much a puzzle as it is a spectacular mobile. Finding the hidden, moving pieces and understanding how these seemingly random elements work in tandem s half the fun. By contrast, Death is the Melvins sinking their teeth in a tearing out high energy, crushing metal. This time they are supplemented by the pop-stylings of Steven Mcdonald and it just goes to show, now many how many guises the Melvins assume, they are always the Melvins in the very best sense. Unquestionably, one of the very greatest bands of all time. Thee Top Five Narmer Records Releases of 2017 2. The Punknews Banned from the P.C. Mixtape Narmer Records I was very pleased with the My Org tape, but it had a few minor things that nagged me. For Banned from the P.C. I went all out and tried to make the PUNKEST tape I could- with ""punk"" being weirdo, daring, and totally rocking music. Honestly, with exclusive and rare tracks from Ari Up, Steve Ignorant, DFL (first new song in 17 years!), Chris Gethard, and more... an appearance by Jello... AND AN INTRO BY KEITH MORRIS HIMSELF, I will go ahead and pat myself on the back with this one. It's rare that a project comes out exactly as you envisioned it, but I am so proud of this release and don’t mind saying so. Of course, the most important thing is to thank all the bands that made this tape possible with their generosity. We literally could not have done it without you. Narmer Records This was one for the books, and frankly, a part of me is a little sad to be closing this chapter. In 2015, I found a cool used record at Jupiter records. It was weird and unique and really, really good. I called the 30 year old number written on the back and somehow wound up in contact with the guy who recorded the album, but never actually put it out! Thanks to Michael J. Richards generosity, I was finally able to put this record out into the world and boy what a thrill that was. THIS is what punk is all about- not worrying about how something will be received, not worrying about the business aspect, just doing it for the sake of art. Now, it's your turn! Go out and do something awesome! YOU BET WE’VE GOT SOMETHING PERSONAL AGAINST YOU! Even though 2017 was jam packed, 2018 already has an insane amount of cool releases on deck. First up, I am ULTRA-PSYCHED for the new Screaming Females record and I am TURBO-PSYCHED for the new The Dwarves record. If their recent super-charged live shows have indicated anything, this record will be HARDCORE. Word is that OFF! is working on LP #4. Harley Flanagan has been hinting at some new stuff. DFL has been posting studio updates with Greg Hetson which is very, very exciting. Tsunami Bomb is working on their first LP in almost 20 years, including Dom Davi and Oubliette, and that will be a ripper, no doubt. Rats in the Wall have a new EP on the horizon which is sure to be killer. Jesse Luscious’ The Pathogens have been active and let’s hope they put out something as now is the time! World/Inferno and Mischief Brew have both been teasing at some reissues, which should be very cool. Op Ivy’s Dave Mello has joined Kicker so hopefully we get something from THAT killer combo. Let’s hope for some new Crazy and the Brains material. It’s time, boys! There will likely be some more The Rolling Stones archival material, and Eagle has been doing an amazing job with that curation. Of course, the reigning champs Melvins are sure to put out an album or two or three… and JELLO, how about a new album, dawg? It is time! For my part, I plan on doing more longer form interviews, though I’d like to also do some more unexpected, unusual interviews, too. So, for 2018, I will be going for super detailed, quality pieces, and not so much quantity. I definitely plan on doing some more Punknews shows- I just want to try to make every show special and unique. At Punknews, I think we have a good vibe going and have a good angle on things, but I’d like to tighten up the ship a little and widen our coverage a little bit. To that end, I will be bringing in a TON of new writers at Punknews in 2018, so if you want to join up, NOW is the time: johnG@punknews.org. Also, feel free to write to me with your thoughts. I usually try to end my Best Ofs with some wisdom gleaned from the year or something inspirational. Unfortunately for me, more and more, I gravitate towards the nihilistic view of Early LA punk and the unflinching salute to the void a la Rudimentary Peni… So, I will say this. Do what you love. Try to make the world a better place, Put out interesting art. Be nice to people. And, frikkin go for it, man. Who knows how much time we have left, so the time to do it is NOW. To quote the J-man, start a fire! HEY! HO! 2018, LET’S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","WE COME TO DO DAMAGE Whew! Whew! Wheeeewwww weeeeeeeeee!!!!! Yowza.

CBSNewYork,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) — Some signature sounds around the city could be changing.There’s a push by some city lawmakers to change emergency sirens on police cars, fire trucks and ambulances.
“I’ve been hearing from constituents complaining that the current sirens in New York are a high-pitched, continuous noise — a nuisance,” says Helen Rosenthal, an Upper West Side Democrat and one of the sponsors of the proposal.
The sound could change to an alternating, two-tone siren that’s typically heard in London and Paris. Supporters say European-style sirens are not as annoying and could reduce noise pollution.
“The alternating high-low siren required by this legislation is not as piercing,” said co-sponsor Carlina Rivera, a Manhattan Democrat.

City council members are looking closely at the experience of the city’s Mount Sinai Health System, which already uses the two-tone siren in its 25 ambulances that make about 100,000 trips a year. The switch was made last year after decades of complaints from residents of the Upper East Side home of the hospital complex.

At community board meetings, Mount Sinai’s Emergency Medical Services Director Joseph Davis played various siren options to find out which one locals preferred.
“People hated them all,” Davis said, “but the ‘high-low’ was least intrusive. It didn’t have that piercing sound.”
Davis, a 40-year EMS veteran who suffers from hearing damage that he blames on repeated exposure to sirens, said the change was simple and cost effective: All it took was reprogramming the electronic box in each vehicle, which comes preloaded with seven different sounds with names such as “Wail,” ”Yelp” and “Piercer.”
In fact, many ambulances, fire trucks and police cars are equipped with alternate sirens and horns that they can employ in certain situations, such as in traffic when cars and pedestrians just won’t get out of the way. They include short blips and the “Rumbler” low-frequency, vibrating siren aimed at motorists who may otherwise be unable to hear higher frequencies.
For some Manhattanites, any change in the city’s daily siren song would be welcomed.
“I always have to cover my ears with my hands when a siren-blaring ambulance passes,” said Louise Belulovich, a Manhattan attorney. “If I’m carrying packages and unable to, then what is an annoying experience becomes a painful one.”
But Linda Sachs, a longtime resident of Manhattan’s Upper West Side who lives near one of the Mount Sinai hospitals that uses the new European siren, doesn’t think the change is for the good. She prefers the old New York standard.
“The old sirens never woke me up, but these make me shudder,” Sachs said, adding that she understands city lawmakers are attempting to do something about noise pollution. “But the old sound wasn’t as obnoxious.”
A city council vote has not been scheduled yet, but, if approved, the legislation would require all emergency vehicles to change their sirens within two years.
