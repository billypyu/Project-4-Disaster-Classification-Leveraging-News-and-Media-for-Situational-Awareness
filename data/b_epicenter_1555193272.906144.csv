M.H. MILLER,"IV. The City THE COUNTRY HAS imposed a narrative myth upon Detroit: that it was one of the iconic modern cities until the riot of 1967, one of the worst race riots in the country’s history, which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage and resulted in the abandonment of the city by the middle class. The reality is that Detroit’s modernization is what most contributed to its collapse. In 1963, as David Maraniss recalls in his 2015 history of Detroit’s heyday, “ Once in a Great City,” Wayne State University’s Institute for Regional and Urban Studies issued a report predicting that Detroit’s population — about 1.7 million as of the 1960 census — would decline by roughly a quarter by 1970 as a result of people increasingly leaving the city for the suburbs. With more businesses opening in the suburbs to support a growing middle class, there was less and less incentive for people to live and, more important, work in Detroit. The previous decade of construction, which had brought such remarkable architecture to downtown Detroit, had produced little in the way of actual housing, and had in fact uprooted many of the city’s predominantly lower-class neighborhoods. As Maraniss writes, “Detroit was being threatened by its own design of concrete and metal and fuel and movement.” This was the case in many American cities that had prospered during the manufacturing boom of World War II, only to find such growth unsustainable. But none suffered quite as much as Detroit: With its empty Art Deco skyscrapers and entire neighborhoods effectively erased from the map through abandonment and arson, the city inevitably became a symbol of postwar America’s rise and fall. After Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013, the largest municipality to ever do so, downtown began to experience a development boom again thanks to the billionaire Dan Gilbert, who since 2010 has invested $3.5 billion in real estate downtown (with another $2.1 billion underway) and moved his mortgage company, Quicken Loans, and other businesses into the buildings. In January, I walked around the city with Brian Conway, Michigan’s state historic preservation officer and the co-author of a two-volume series of books called “ Michigan Modern.” We visited the Wayne State campus and Yamasaki’s McGregor Memorial Conference Center, a miraculous white box with white marble floors and white marble columns leading up to a series of second-story pointed hexagonal column capitals. Triangular skylight panels are arranged in a grid on the ceiling. It was raining heavily, and the space was cold and drafty. We also walked through Albert Kahn’s staggeringly beautiful Fisher Building, completed in 1928, a year before the American economy collapsed, and which a placard in the lobby describes as the city’s “largest art object.” The interior is covered in gold detailing, with chandeliers hanging like white pine cones from the ceiling. The ceiling itself displays an enormous mural of nude women with musical instruments, including a harp, surrounded by eagles and laurels. The elevators have bronze doors, carved with images of deities, one of them holding a car in one hand and a plane in the other. The building, after years of neglect, sold in 2015 (together with the neighboring 11-story Albert Kahn Building) for $12.2 million to a pair of developers (they are among the few landmarked skyscrapers Gilbert has not purchased) and is starting to fill up with businesses, which serve as a reminder of just how much distance there is between Kahn and our current moment: Muting the drama of the building slightly were several signs in the lobby directing visitors toward a Subway sandwich shop inside Cadillac Place, the former General Motors headquarters, also designed by Kahn, which is connected to the Fisher Building through a walkway.","Frank Lloyd Wright’s Sara and Melvyn Smith House, in the Michigan suburb of Bloomfield Hills.

"James Crugnale on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","This past spring, Ohio found itself at the epicenter of a fight over a long-lost predator that’s quietly making inroads across the Midwest: the bobcat. A controversial bobcat hunting proposal came to a head in May when sportsmen organizations squared off with conservationists over whether the population had rebounded enough to support a limited trapping season of up to 60 animals, something the Ohio Department of Natural Resources first proposed back in February. At present, 40 states allow the killing of bobcats. “There’s enough there,” Keith Daniels from the Ohio State Trappers Association told the Columbus Dispatch in March. “We don’t want to see a resource go to waste just because someone thinks we shouldn’t.” But the state’s proposal, which came less than four years after Ohio removed bobcats from the endangered list, was met with vocal opposition from conservationists and activists. Some opponents pointed out that Ohio’s bobcats have only recently showed signs of recovery, while their overall numbers throughout the state remain unknown. Others worried that even a limited hunting season could get out of hand quickly. “I have no doubt that the statewide quota would be exceeded on the first or second day,” Suzanne Prange, director of the Appalachian Wildlife Research Institute and opponent of the plan, told Earther, noting that the state was only planning to charge trappers $5 per hunting permit. “My biggest fear was how much it might be exceeded by the time the state could halt the season. They could seriously hurt the population before the season could be stopped.” It’s a microcosm of a fight that’s raging out across the Midwest, where the bobcat has made an extraordinary comeback in recent decades, largely to the credit of state wildlife management agencies and reforestation efforts. But as is the case with other recovering carnivores like Yellowstone’s grizzly bears, there remains vehement disagreement over whether these animals are ready for humans to start hunting them again. An elusive 20 to 30 pound creature known for its distinctive bobbed tail, bobcats historically ranged across a vast swath of North America from northern Mexico to southern Canada. But hunting and trapping, along with the conversion of forests to farmland and the subsequent decline of their prey, took a serious toll on these predators. By the early 1900s, bobcats were virtually extirpated from the Midwest and parts of the eastern United States. “In many states, bobcats were driven to the brink of extinction–or even completely extirpated in some areas–due to loss of habitat, over-hunting, and trapping,” Samantha Hagio, director of wildlife protection at the Humane Society of the United States, told Earther. But around the same time that bobcats were vanishing, policy shifts were setting the stage for their eventual rebound. David McNitt, a grad student at Virginia Tech who focuses his research on bobcats, observed that with the creation of the National Forest System in the early 1900s, the bobcat was provided “large swaths of habitat to act as population refuges.” With the introduction of state agency regulations surrounding hunting and trapping in the decades that followed, the big cat began to re-colonize much of its native distribution. “There’s enough there.” By the late 1990s, bobcats were increasing “throughout the majority of their range,” according to a detailed national survey released in 2010. Even in the Midwest, where, as McNitt observed, public lands are scarce and landscapes are “dominated with monoculture farms” bobcat numbers have appeared to improve just enough to have their conservation status downgraded. Bobcats were removed from Illinois’ list of threatened species in 1999, and they were taken off Indiana’s endangered list in 2005. By 2007, Iowa’s once-endangered bobcats had recovered enough to support limited hunting seasons. In Ohio, bobcats were downgraded from endangered to threatened in 2012 and removed from the endangered species list altogether in 2014. But despite the general upward trend of bobcat numbers (as of 2010, the total US population sat somewhere between 2.3 and 3.6 million ), some experts have cautioned that populations may still remain at risk. “Local threats may decrease population success through time,” Imogene Cancellare, a wildlife biologist at the University of Delaware, told Earther. “Not all populations in the United States are stable, or growing.” During the impassioned debate in Ohio over whether to allow trapping, proponents argued that a 60-bobcat cap wouldn’t put the animal’s numbers at risk. The state Department of Natural Resources agreed. “We’re confident the population is secure. We’re not trying to reduce the number of bobcats,” Mike Reynolds, Wildlife Research Administrator for the ODNR Division of Wildlife told the Dispatch in March. But ultimately, in May, the Ohio Wildlife Council felt that there wasn’t enough information to make a determination either way. By a 6 to 1 vote, the council decided to delay the proposed trapping season until there was more definitive data showing a “thriving population”. One member of the council suggested waiting until after a four-year population study —currently underway by Viorel Popescu and wildlife researchers at Ohio University—was completed. The debate over whether to allow bobcat harvesting is not confined to Ohio. In May, a proposal to open bobcat hunting and trapping in Indiana was shot down by the Indiana Natural Resources Commission after more than 1,300 citizens reportedly spoke out in opposition during the public comment period. Similar debates are playing out with other wild carnivores—albeit significantly more threatened ones—such as the grizzly bear. In May, Wyoming’s Game and Fish Commission voted unanimously to allow the hunting of up to 22 grizzly bears this fall. The decision was met with fierce blowback from conservationists, so much so that a district court could reverse it this week. More and more states are allowing gray wolves to be hunted as populations recover, but those hunts remain equally controversial. For bobcats, recent battles over opening hunting seasons have mostly taken place on the state level. But with the Trump administration weakening wildlife protections for threatened and endangered species and increasing certain privileges for hunters (not to mention Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proudly tweeting a photo of the stuffed bobcat in his office ), it’s possible that the federal government could soon join the fray. The future for the elusive cats, while brighter than it once was, remains tinged with uncertainty. James Crugnale is an environmental journalist from Brooklyn.","This past spring, Ohio found itself at the epicenter of a fight over a long-lost predator that’s quietly making inroads across the Midwest: the bobcat.

Jonathan Shieber,"Emerging venture capital firms in smaller American cities from Indianapolis to Princeton, NJ are attracting increasingly larger funding as investors see opportunities for returns beyond the coastal confines of the nation’s largest cities and the innovation epicenter of Silicon Valley. For the last four years, AOL co-founder Steve Case has been criss-crossing the country preaching a gospel of economic renewal for American cities driven by startup investment and technology-based entrepreneurialism. With Case those journeys culminated in the creation of a fund called Rise of the Rest — a $150 million vehicle raised by some of tech’s highest-profile names. Investors like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet; Jim Bryer, the former head of the National Venture Capital Association and an early investor in Facebook; Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers partner John Doerr; and Facebook’s former President Sean Parker; came together with the family offices of some of America’s wealthiest people to back the fund. As Schmidt told The Times, “There is a large selection of relatively undervalued businesses in the heartland between the coasts, some of which can scale quickly.” Steve Case (Revolution LLC) at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017 Case and his partner JD Vance (the author of Hillbilly Elegy ) are only two of the would-be pioneers that are bringing the venture investment model to the Midwest. In fact, i t has been about four years since Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen left the West Coast and Silicon Valley to launch Drive Capital — the venture capital firm they founded in Columbus, Ohio. In that time the firm has managed to raise over half a billion dollars to invest in startups based primarily in the Midwest, and has spurred an investment revolution in areas of the country that are more synonymous with tractors than with technological innovation. But the Midwestern investment scene isn’t just defined by Valley transplants coming in. Some of the entrepreneurs behind the region’s home-grown success stories, like Indianapolis’ ExactTarget, have launched funds of their own to plant an entirely new crop of tech companies in the Midwest. Homegrown Heroes These are funds like High Alpha, which just closed its second $85 million fund, High Alpha Capital II, and raised another $16.5 million for a companion venture studio that ideates and incubates startups. High Alpha doesn’t exclusively invest in the Midwest, but the bulk of its commitments are definitely falling outside of the typical geographies where most investors spend their time, according to High Alpha managing partner Scott Dorsey, the former chief executive of Salesforce’s Indianapolis-based ExactTarget business. For its venture studio, the firms was able to bring back Emergence Capital, the San Francisco-based software as a service investor, and woo new investor Foundry Capital, a Boulder, Colo.-based firm co-founded by the legendary investor Brad Feld. Both Feld and Gordon Ritter, the founder of Emergence Capital will take seats on the High Alpha Studios board. High Alpha investments have been made in Atlanta, Chicago, Des Moines, Minneapolis, Seattle and Toronto, says Dorsey. “ You have a big economic advantage where these companies don’t have to raise nearly as much money,” Dorsey says, echoing the sentiment from Schmidt. “ The neat thing also is they see that there’s not just one technology company in town and if it doesn’t work out you’re packing up and moving and seeing an actual ecosystem.” Dorsey and the High Alpha team focus their investments on marketing and automation software — an area that can run the gamut from drone use in agricultural applications to a software service that monitors company spending on business software so that the procurement process can be more efficient. While the venture arm is one way that the firm is seeding a new generation of technology companies across the midwest and around the country, the venture studio is focused on building businesses in Indianapolis itself, Dorsey says. Through the studio, Dorsey and his partners have plans to start eight to 10 new software as a service businesses, and High Alpha is tapping local talent to do it. For instance, Dorsey’s former colleague Scott McCorkle, who ran the marketing cloud business for Salesforce, is now working on a company that High Alpha is incubating. “We are always building that stable of entrepreneurs,” Dorsey says. Initiatives in states like Indiana are also helping to encourage a more entrepreneurial and tech focused mindset, according to Dorsey. Like other states, Indiana is now mandating computer science classes for every grade from K-12 in public schools. The state also has created a $250 million fund-of-funds to invest in venture funds that will commit capital to companies that will bring jobs to the state. Finally, Indiana has passed a law to forego collecting sales tax on software as a service companies that are developing and selling products and services in the state. Look Homeward (Investment) Angel State incentives aside, there are structural reasons for the moves in the midwest. The companies require less capital to scale compared to companies on the coasts, thanks to rising real estate prices and the intense competition for talent. Indigenous venture investors are springing up thanks to earlier bets on technology companies coming from the region. U.S. land grant colleges, which may well be the most underappreciated heroes of American economic growth, are increasingly becoming startup hubs. With new companies emerging from Ann Arbor, Mich., Columbus, Ohio and Madison, Wis. “ At the end of the day. The world is flat and entrepreneurs are everywhere and with technology it’s possible to start a company anywhere,” says Deven Parekh, the managing director of the multi-billion dollar growth equity investment firm Insight Venture Partners. “ The West Coast is not necessarily the optimal place to start a company. The cost structure is prohibitive and there’s lots of turnover.” For some firms, the revelation of abounding opportunities in states where the wind goes sweeping through the plains isn’t all that new. Growth capital firms like Edison Partners, the Princeton, N.J.-based investor which just closed on its tenth fund with $300 million has long been an investor in far-flung geographies. Only a minority of the firm’s investments fall inside the North Atlantic corridor of Boston and New York, according to partner Chris Sugden. The rapid growth of VC deals in NY Metro, Midwest, and LA compared to stable growth in New England. “Two-thirds of our investments are outside of New York or Boston [and] we haven’t participated in the Valley,” Sugden says. “ My fear of being a tourist is overpriced deals like overpriced restaurants with not good quality food.” For the 30 years it has been in business, Edison has backed companies outside of the traditional investment lanes for tech investors. “These ecosystems have been in place for a long time. The challenge for them has always been scale,” Sugden says. “What’s happening right now is an interesting theme,” he added. “People leaving the Valley and leaving New York to go back to the South and go back to the Southeast. There’s a little bit more excitement and energy in these off of coast towns.” And exits are beginning to follow this exodus. ExactTarget planted a flag in Indianapolis’s tech ecosystem (and the recent public offering for PluralSight was another big win for the city), while Groupon did the same in Chicago. Now a new generation of entrepreneurs is getting its first taste of Valley returns. These are people like Bill Smith, whose Birmingham, Ala.-based grocery delivery business Shipt was acquired by Target for $550 million late last year. For Sugden, the four critical components an emerging tech ecosystem need to take flight are an educational hub to produce talent, an urban center to capture it, capital to sustain it, and government and traditional industry support to accelerate it. “I’ve seen first-hand the incredible entrepreneurs trying to build great businesses outside of Silicon Valley,” said Vance, in a statement announcing the Rise of the Rest fund last year. “They often possess all the ingredients for success, but struggle to find enough investment capital to break through and have a positive impact on their region.”","Emerging venture capital firms in smaller American cities from Indianapolis to Princeton, NJ are attracting increasingly larger funding as investors see opportunities for returns beyond the coastal confines of the nation’s largest cities and the innovation ep…",2018-07-18T23:36:47Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Midwest rising,http://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/midwest-rising/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/midwest_states.png?w=711,techcrunch,TechCrunch,epicenter,1

Ed Cara,"Since March, hundreds of people in the U.S. have come down with horrific, Ebola-like symptoms of bleeding. The initially mysterious cases are now thought to have been caused by synthetic cannabinoid products that were laced with rat poison. And a new report published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine details some of the first cases at the epicenter of the outbreak. Just over 200 cases and five deaths across nine states are linked to the bleeding outbreak, now formally known as synthetic cannabinoidassociated coagulopathy, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Illinois was the first to report cases in mid-March, and as of late May, it has had the majority of victims (164). And one of the hardest-hit areas in the state was Peoria County. The study looked at 34 patients who were admitted to the Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria from late March to April. The patients arrived at the hospital with common symptoms of blood in their urine, internal bleeding, and crippling stomach pain. Others showed up bleeding from their ears, eyes, or nose. And in one tragic, ultimately fatal, case, a 37-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital already unconscious with spontaneous bleeding inside her skull. Within 15 hours of her admission, the authors wrote, she became brain dead. Eventually, the doctors began to realize the common link between patients. Typical rat poison is filled with lots of chemicals, but its main ingredient is often brodifacoum, a potent blood thinner. Brodifacoum and similar chemicals are known as superwarfarins, a reference to the common anticoagulant drug used to help people with clogged arteries. And of the 15 patients who had their blood tested, all of them had brodifacoum in their system. Superwarfarins deplete the body of vitamin K, which helps us clot blood. So the typical course of treatment for superwarfarin poisoning is massive doses of vitamin K, which usually need to be taken orally for months. But initially, Illinois doctors found it difficult to get the enormous and expensive supply needed for their patients, since a typical supplement wouldnt come close to containing enough vitamin K. It is actually very expensive, senior author Jonathan Roberts told NBC News. Its somewhere around $24,000 to $34,000 a month. In late April, however, health officials were able to secure a donation of 800,000 tablets from the Bausch Foundation, a charitable arm of the Canadian-based Valeant Pharmaceutical, which produces the supplement. After reaching a peak in April, the outbreak petered out. But newer cases within the state have been reported as late as June. We also still dont know how and why rat poison ended up in these products in the first place. The Food and Drug Administration has previously admitted the possibility that manufacturers purposefully added rat poison to their supply, hoping to boost the drugs intoxicating effect. But given the black box nature of manufacturing synthetic cannabinoids and other designer drugs (usually in China), theres really no excluding the possibility of inadvertent contamination. We realized that this is not something that [doctors] see very often, lead author Amar Keller told Live Science. Regardless of the outbreaks origins, the authors hope their report can help other doctors better handle any future cases of this frightening condition.

Bryan Menegus,"If local headlines are to be believed, not much happens in Shakopee. But on Friday evening, this placid town of 40,000 on the outskirts of Minnesotas Twin Cities became the epicenter of the fight for humane working conditions at one of the worlds most valuable companies. For the last two years, Amazon has quietly expanded its presence in the suburb, and worker resentment towards conditions there has grown with it, culminating in todays protest outside fulfillment center MSP1a sprawling 850,000-square-foot structure abutting a heavy industrial zoneattended by local activists and joined by Amazon workers ending their shifts. It ended with approximately 250 people marching on the buildings main entrance. The discontent primarily began as a reaction to allegations that the pace Amazon set for its workers, many of whom are practicing Muslims, was impacting their religious freedom. The United States is home to the largest population of Somalis besides Yemenmany of whom fled to the U.S. to escape genocide, civil war, and terrorismand the overwhelming majority of them reside in Minnesota. As reported by Gizmodo in June, Amazon structures its performance metrics in such a way that makes basic necessities, like prayer or bathroom breaks, prohibitively difficult, sometimes leading to docked pay or termination for those who cannot meet the companys arduous expectations. Fridays protest was intended to pressure Amazon to not only improve working conditions and allow for proper religious expression, but to create a fund that addresses racial disparities in the community and set up an independent review body for HR complaints. I toured this facility, and what I saw was a company that did not know who they were employing. Amazon has little room to plead ignorance to the calls of the workers in Shakopee: Similar labor actions took place in its home base of Seattle nearly two years ago when Muslim security workers held a pray-in to protest Amazons unwillingness to provide a prayer space. Bloomberg reported that activists within the Shakopee facilities previously brought demands to Amazon over the summer, when the Muslim holiday of Ramadan intersected with Prime Day, an annual celebration of consumerism. I toured this facility, Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the crowd Friday evening, and what I saw was a company that did not know who they were employing. The action outside MSP1 was organized in part by Awood Center (awood is Somali for power), a relatively new and lean group focused on workers rights in the East African community around Minneapolis. Though Amazon disagreed with the characterization, the New York Times previously reported that these workers and Awood Center were able to achieve the unprecedented in getting Amazon to come to the bargaining table. We have now met twice with Amazon management, which hasnt happened anywhere else as far as we know, Abdirahman Muse, the executive director of Awood Center, told Gizmodo. While a victory in its own right, Amazon has not, according to Muse, offered any acceptable changes yet, necessitating Fridays protest. MSP1 is a fairly new and heavily-roboticized factory, much like the facility on Staten Island, New York, where workers recently announced their intention to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). One worker at the Staten Island facility, in a protest outside New Yorks City Hall last week, expressed concern over long shifts, non-functioning smoke detectors and sprinkler systems, and inhumane temperatures. We have asked the company to provide air conditioning, she explained to the crowd, but they told us that the robots inside cant work in the cold weather. One worker getting off his shift at MSP1 (we were unable to get his name) told Gizmodo that the rate of the work continues to climb while the workers remain utterly expendable, toiling in poor conditions. If you work with me, he said, you will be sick within a week. Another MSP1 worker, Khadra Kassim, told the crowd through a translator that due to a workplace injury she nearly miscarried her unborn daughter. Weve reached out to Amazon for comment on the MSP1 workers demands and claims of unfair treatment and harsh working conditions. We will update when we receive a response. Joining the group of protesters outside MSP1 was Representative-elect Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American representative in the U.S. Congress. Amazon doesnt work if you dont work, she said to wild cheers, and its about time we make Amazon understand that. Minnesota Lieutenant Governor-elect Peggy Flanagan also passed on words of encouragement to workers through an unlisted video on the governor-elects Youtube channel, stating, Today, my hope for you is that you can organize in partnership to create jobs at Amazon that are fair, safe, and reliable. She stressed the importance of collective bargaining, something Amazon has been widely viewed as hostile toward since Gizmodo obtained an internal anti-union training video in September. Just before 5pm, the crowd of protesters moved from the sidewalk in front of MSP1where they had set up a massive prayer rug as well as an amplification system from the bed of a pickup truckand marched on the building itself. Police officers, who had not been present earlier in the day, lay in wait in the parking lot and were joined by additional units including Minnesota State Patrol officers and the Scott County sheriff, approximately 16 vehicles in total. The Shakopee Police Department confirmed in a phone call with Gizmodo, no arrests, no property damage, no injuries. In the moment, officers seemed confused as to which individuals were protesters and which were simply leaving work. The crowd, meanwhile, dispersed peacefully, chanting, Amazonwell be back.","If local headlines are to be believed, not much happens in Shakopee.

The storm was among the deadliest in modern American history and caused one of the longest blackouts the world has ever seen. Supercharged hurricanes are among the most dramatic direct impacts society faces from climate change, but students were also there because of the great unraveling underway.
Grace, a student at Beacon High School, told Earther she was concerned about biodiversity loss citing recent studies about disappearing insect habitat and species loss as part of the sixth mass extinction underway.
Grace from Beacon High School.
The manmade system of capitalism and its reliance on fossil fuels to drive growth are the prime drivers of climate change. The injustice of that system and the future its creating are on the forefront of strikers minds.
They dont want to face the facts we need to change the system if we are to try to act on the climate crisis, strike organizers, including Greta Thunberg who sparked the movement and Alexandria Villasenor who has driven it in the U.S., wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian earlier Friday.
What system change looks like remains to be seen. There were chants for the Green New Deal that echoed off the the stately apartments of Central Park Westas strikers headed toward the American Museum of Natural History 20 blocks north, but the strike movement hasnt endorsed it as a policy. Nevertheless, some politicians appear aware that the seeds of a radical political movement are emerging in the U.S.. Washington State Governor and Democratic presidential candidateJay Inslee spoke at an event at Columbia hosted by the youth activist organizationSunrise Movement and showed up at the main strike event in solidarity. 
We need them, he told Earther. We needed to inspire the rest of the country to rise to their challenge to not allow their generation to be damaged by those who have gone before.
Im with these kids body and soul, he said despite the fact that many of them in fact wont be able to vote for him or any candidate in the next election. And I hope more people are as well.

A cryoseism occurs when an area of land thats been saturated with water experiences a very sudden drop from above-freezing to subzero temperatures. This drastic temperature change causes the groundwater to freezeand therefore expandso suddenly that its surroundings cant shift to accommodate it, causing pressure to build under the surface. The pressure continues to build until the rocks and dirt cant take it anymore and, well, explode, usually with a startlingly loud crack or boom. Its less scary than it sounds: unlike the earthquakes theyre often mistaken for, cryoseisms are very localized and relatively low-energy. Unless youre right on top of the epicenter, the noises are the worst of it.
Frost quakes have already been reported in Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania; with the forecast promising even colder temperatures tomorrow, its likely that more are on the way.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"LENDE TOVEA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The lives of many villagers living at the epicenter of a devastating earthquake that struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and killed more than 1,600 people were spared because they had been terrified by a smaller one that hit three hours earlier. A coastal strip dotted with villages north of the devastated city of Palu was cut off for nearly a week by landslides blocking its single road link after the major 7.5 magnitude quake struck late in the afternoon on Sept. 28. But the way is now open and aid is starting to trickle in to the area that rescue workers feared had been obliterated. While destruction is extensive, with many houses destroyed, villagers said on Saturday countless lives were saved by a 6.1 magnitude quake that struck about 20 km (12 miles) to the south about three hours earlier. “Luckily most people were already outside,” said Rahman Lakuaci, chief of Lende Tovea village in Sirenja district. “Everyone ran outside when the first quake happened and few people were brave enough to go back in.” Authorities have yet to conduct a tally of casualties in Sirenja and the other districts near the epicenter north of Palu, but Lakuaci estimated dozens of people had been killed in the area. The city of Palu, on the other hand, 78 km (48 miles) away, suffered heavy casualties, with hotels, shopping malls and countless houses destroyed in the quake and by a tsunami that scoured the city’s oceanfront shortly after. Soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, also killed many hundreds of people in and around Palu. But that did not happen near the epicenter of the quake and, even though many villagers ran up into the hills rising to the east of the coastline, tsunami waves did not crash into the small fishing communities and pretty beaches. The quake brought down power lines and communications networks and more than half the houses in Sirenja district were destroyed. Those left standing were so battered they were “not fit for use”, Lakuaci said. Most would have to torn down and rebuilt, he said. People have survived the past week by searching for food in fields and orchards and scavenging in the forested hills. Thousands of people are living in tents and crude shelters and some supplies have been flow in by helicopter. “What we need most now are tents and medicine,” Lakuaci said. Children and the elderly were starting to get sick and fuel was also in very short supply, he said. The area saw no looting after the quake, unlike in Palu, largely because there are no big warehouses and village leaders mobilized their volunteers to maintain order, villagers said.

Violet Blue,"Ah, security purposes, our favorite road to hell paved with some kind of intentions. Is it like when Facebook took people's phone numbers for security purposes and handed them to advertisers ? Sorry, I'm just a little cynical right now. The report explained the purpose of corporate bosses chipping their workers like a beloved Pekinese is to set restrictions on areas they can access within the companies. ""One prospective client,"" The Telegraph wrote, ""which cannot be named, is a major financial services firm with ""hundreds of thousands of employees."" Jowan Österlund, founder of chip-implant company Biohax at the center of this deal, told the outlet: ""These companies have sensitive documents they are dealing with. [The chips] would allow them to set restrictions for whoever... In a company with 200,000 employees, you can offer this as an opt-in,"" said Mr. Österlund. ""If you have a 15 percent uptake that is still a huge number of people that won't require a physical ID pass."" Never mind that RFID badge cloning is trivial to the point of funsies for hackers (who have been experimenting with hacking biochips for a while ), this is about employee efficiency. A further selling point for companies grinding privacy into bottom-line dust is that it'll save a company money. ""As well as restricting access to controlled areas,"" The Telegraph said, ""microchips can be used by staff to speed up their daily routines. For instance, they could be used to quickly buy food from the canteen, enter the building or access printers at a fastened rate."" As some readers may recall, this isn't the first instance of employee chipping in recent news. Last year, American company Three Square Market in Wisconsin made headlines when 80 of its employees got chips implanted. They use the little RFID chips in their hands (the size of a grain of rice, like the one in your cat) to scan themselves into security areas, use computers and vending machines. Interestingly, Three Square sells vending machine ""mico markets"" but offers a cottage industry in implants (with an angle on their use for "" law enforcement solutions ""). Yet the first US company to inject workers with tracking chips was a Cincinnati surveillance firm in 2006, which required all employees working in its secure data center to have RFIDs implanted in their triceps. Coming from a spying company, it's almost like asking if you'd like your Orwell with a little Orwell on top. California in 2007 swiftly moved to block companies from being able to make RFID implants mandatory, as well as blocking the chipping of students in the state. Don't get me wrong: becoming a cyborg sounds pretty awesome. It's a fairly popular pastime for DEF CON attendees who like their hackery edge-play to get a souvenir implant while at the conference. But those people are hackers, and they know what they're getting into. And I'm just that annoying person worried about normal people not knowing how they can get pwned, and who has a few irritating questions about personal security and privacy. According to MIT Technology review, the Three Square Market employees said they liked it — the convenience outweighed personal privacy and security concerns, which could include surveillance by higher-ups, or attackers doing a little drive-by data sniffing (when hackers ping your chip to see what's on it). President of Three Square, Patrick McMullan, told MIT that only some of the info on the chip is encrypted ""but he argues that similar personal information could be stolen from his wallet, too."" Unlike a company ID card, you can't leave it at home. We might imagine that with all of these privacy and tracking concerns, female employees dealing with harassment would have an extra layer to worry about. MIT only quoted male employees, so that's worth noting. The chip-your-workpets trend spreading to the US and UK got its foothold in Sweden where apparently they are much cooler about becoming the Borg than we are. Swedish incubator Epicenter in Stockholm ""includes 100 companies and roughly 2,000 workers, began implanting workers in January 2015,"" reported LA Times. ""Now, about 150 workers have the chips."" Jowan Osterlund from Biohax Sweden, holds a small microchip implant, similar to those implanted into workers at the Epicenter digital innovation business center The chief experience officer at Epicenter, Fredric Kaijser, told press: ""People ask me, 'Are you chipped?' and I say, 'Yes, why not?' And they all get excited about privacy issues and what that means and so forth. And for me it's just a matter of I like to try new things and just see it as more of an enabler and what that would bring into the future."" Again, I'll annoy you by pointing out that the evangelists here all seem to be dudes, which isn't a bad thing. It maybe might suggest no one's thinking about the inevitable DEF CON talk ""Chipped employees: Fun with attack vectors,"" or a possible future headline about employee stalking or chip-based discrimination. I mean, we can already imagine the ones where ICE demands the last known doors opened by all employees on the RFID database who happen to be brown. I'm sure it's all well and good until someone gets locked out of their own hand. Or the app used to access your hand gets compromised. Like I said earlier, it's at the ""damn the consequences, full speed ahead"" stage.

Camila Domonoske,"Updated at 2:05 p.m. ET A magnitude 7.0 earthquake has hit southern Alaska, with its epicenter just north of Anchorage. A tsunami warning was temporarily issued for coastal regions of Cook Inlet and the Southern Kenai Peninsula, but it has since been canceled. The earthquake struck just before 8:30 a.m. local time (12:29 p.m. ET). The epicenter was about 8 miles north of Anchorage, at a depth of some 25 miles. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, some of them strong. The original earthquake powerfully shook Anchorage, the most populous city in Alaska. Some schools and businesses across the city are closing for the day. ""I've been here 11 years and I've felt movers before, but that scared me s***less,"" Anchorage resident Kevin Bartley told reporter Nat Herz of Alaska Public Media. ""That's the quickest I've ever seen one come on and the hardest I've ever seen it shake. ""The transformers were blowing up... It felt like for a minute we might watch that ground open up,"" Bartley said. The United States Geological Survey estimates that there is a low probability of fatalities, since most people in the region live in buildings that can withstand an earthquake. Some economic damage is possible, though, the USGS says.

Nick Douglas,"Last week’s terrifying false missile alert in Hawaii has Americans asking one of our favorite questions, “What if it happened here?” While statistically, your hometown is probably not a nuclear target, historian Alex Wellerstein’s NUKEMAP shows you what it would look like. The effect of a nuclear explosion depends on many factors, like the size of the bomb, what it’s targeting, and what the wind is like. NUKEMAP lets you experiment with all kinds of nuclear scenarios using stats for different known nuclear weapons, mapping out which areas would be burnt to a crisp, and which would just be blanketed with radiation. You can get an estimate of the death count, how many local schools and hospitals would go down, and how today’s weather would affect the fallout. You can use NUKEMAP’s sister site MISSILEMAP to choose from current and historical missile launch sites. While you can use this tool to imagine, say, a French bomb taking out downtown Cleveland, most places in the world are unlikely to ever be nuclear targets outside of an all-out global nuclear annihilation (in which case some of us might rather burn up in the first attack instead of struggling on after the apocalypse). A 2015 panel of nuclear experts estimated that the highest current nuclear risks are in India, Pakistan, the Middle East, and the immediate surroundings of North Korea. If you live in the continental U.S., you’re not in range of any successfully tested North Korean missiles. Last May the Washington Post said even an attack on Hawaii would be “a stretch.” An attack from a country with global capability—and minus longterm allies, that’s just Russia or China— would likely target the U.S.’s own nuclear strongholds, which are mostly located in sparsely populated areas for exactly this reason. But other key military targets are near population centers; the Pentagon, pictured above as the epicenter of a strike from a Russian ICBM, is right in the middle of Washington, D.C. To avoid retaliation for an attack like that, any strike on the U.S. or its allies would need to take out the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal, including the missiles deployed on submarines in secret locations. Since this is nearly impossible, there’s good news for most people: While several countries theoretically could blow up your city, none of them especially want to.

Vahid Salemi/AP Iran says it has ended the search for survivors from a strong earthquake that struck near its border with Iraq over the weekend, killing more than 430 people across the region and injured 7,000. The magnitude 7.3 quake hit late Sunday, with its epicenter located about 19 miles south of Halabjah, Iraq, It was felt as far away as Baghdad and Tehran. ""The rescue operations in the (western) Kermanshah province have ended,"" Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Emergency Medical Services, said on state TV. The Associated Press says that the worst damage from the quake appeared to be in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e Zahab in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, near the border with Iraq. At least 14 provinces in Iran were affected by the temblor. Al Jazeera reports that the Red Crescent Society of Iran deployed staff and volunteers to assist in rescue-and-relief operations but officials acknowledged that finding survivors buried in the rubble was unlikely.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

Taylor Hatmaker,"In a week of harrowing city-level cyber attacks, New York is taking some precautions. While the timing is coincidental, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced that the city will introduce the first tools in its suite of cybersecurity offerings to protect residents against malicious online activity, particularly on mobile devices. When it launches this summer, New York residents will be able to download a free app called NYC Secure. The app will alert smartphone users to potential threats on their devices and offer tips for how to stay secure “such as disconnecting from a malicious Wi-Fi network, navigating away from a compromised website, or uninstalling a malicious app.” Because the app will take no active steps on its own, it’ll be up to users to heed the advice presented to them. NYC Secure will not collect or transmit any personal identifying information or private data. The city will also beef up security over its public wi-fi networks, a notorious target for malicious actors looking to snoop on private information as it passes by unencrypted. The city will implement DNS protection through a service called Quad9, a free public cybersecurity product out of the partnership between Global Cyber Alliance (GCA), IBM and Packet Clearing House. “In order to stay a step ahead of cyber criminals that are continuously finding new ways to hack devices, we must invest in the safety of the digital lives of our residents,” said Geoff Brown, Citywide Chief Information Security Officer. “While no individual is immune to cybersecurity threats, this program will add an extra layer of security to personal devices that often house a huge amount of sensitive data.” New York’s NYC Cyber Command (NYC3), a city-level cyber defense organization established by mayoral executive order in July 2017, will introduce the new public security tools and oversee their implementation. “Initiatives like this one in New York City will help grow awareness of the increasing cyberattack problem and may urge citizens to take more action to protect themselves,” McAfee CEO Christopher Young said of the city’s cyber plan. Because New York faces so many unique cybersecurity threats as an international business hub and a dense cultural epicenter, the city could provide a compelling model for other metropolitan areas looking to take their cyber problems into their own hands.","In a week of harrowing city-level cyber attacks, New York is taking some precautions.

Joe Ciolli,"Reuters / Michael Dalder As the stock market melts down, a great deal of attention is being paid to the obvious culprits: banks, oil, and President Donald Trump's continued insistence upon ratching trade tensions higher. But in a less publicized corner of the equity market, selling pressure has raged, driven by an unfortunate confluence of factors. We're referring to the previously dominant semiconductor sector, which can't seem to sidestep a seemingly endless barrage of negative headlines. The most glaring example on Thursday was the controversial arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. The news rippled through global equities as traders braced for more trade-war tensions. And since Huawei is among the world's biggest producers of smartphones, the chipmaker supply chain took a beating. In terms of specific semiconductor companies, $23 billion Lam Research added to industry-wide pressure on Thursday after its CEO announced he was resigning. Martin Anstice agreed to step down amid an inquity into alleged workplace misconduct. But no discussion of semiconductors is complete without the golden goose itself: Apple. Chipmakers frequently find the fates of their stock prices tied to the latest developments at Apple. And as reports started to trickle in that demand for the new iPhone XR was far weaker than expected, chipmakers absorbed heavy losses. As a result of all that, the wreckage in chipmakers has piled up quickly — and it's been quite severe. The bellwether Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has plunged roughly 18% since reaching a record high in March. For evidence of the sector's dominance prior to that decline, look no further than its 118% return since the start of 2016, through March 12. On a single-stock basis, beloved companies like Nvidia and AMD have been unable to escape the carnage. Both stocks were up more than 45% on a year-to-date basis through the start of October, with Nvidia surging more than 200% over the period. They've both since dropped to multiyear lows. The struggles facing semiconductors are symptomatic of a broad risk aversion that's seeping into global markets. To that end, experts on Wall Street are now recommending cash as a viable asset allocation for the first time in years. And while some strategists have an idea what could save the day in 2019, others are decidedly more pessimistic, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch saying the ""big low"" hasn't yet occurred. In the end, there's no denying it's a tough environment out there right now — one that seems to have turned its back on formerly beloved semiconductors. Which begs the question of which previously embraced industry will be next. As the market hurtles toward disaster in 2019, one expert reveals the 'deus ex machina' that could save the day — and breaks down how it could happen Wall Street's biggest firms are suddenly embracing an asset class that has languished since the financial crisis — and it's a competitive threat to stocks Investors are staring at the bleakest future since the Great Depression — here's why one market bear thinks a crash could wipe 60% from stocks Markets Insider","Semiconductors have been a beacon of stock-market outperformance for months, even years.

JILL COWAN,"On a broad level, he told me, the case reveals a fundamental crisis in American society.
As America has become more and more unequal, affluent parents have become increasingly desperate to pass on their advantages to their children and to avoid downward mobility at all costs, Mr. Karabel said. Elite colleges have become seen as insurance against downward mobility.
That effect is magnified in California, one of the most economically unequal states in the country which also happens to be home to some of the most desirable universities in the country.
California is an epicenter of enormous wealth, he said. And basically where you have major concentrations of wealth, you have the possibility of corruption.
Mr. Karabel said that the alleged scheme appeared to stem less from the parents desire to make sure their children learn than from parental anxiety in a society in which being rich is the best way to stay rich, and if you fall, theres less of a safety net.
In other words, he said, The costs of failure are higher and the rewards of success are also higher.
Still, I talked to Doug Haynes, vice provost for Academic Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at U.C. Irvine, and he emphasized that thousands offirst-generation college students are getting world-class educations at Californias public universities in particular.
The scandal, he said, is troubling in large part because it erodes students trust in those institutions.","Dozens of people were charged in what the authorities said was a scheme to get students admitted to top schools, including the University of Southern California.",2019-03-13T13:11:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: Why Is California All Over the College Admissions Scandal?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/california-college-admissions-scandal-cheating.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/12/us/13usccatoday/12collegeraids-04-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1

ALEXANDRA YOON-HENDRICKS and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The earthquake that struck eastern Los Angeles County on Tuesday caused little damage, but it was a reminder of the seismic volatility in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Forty-seven years ago, a much more powerful earthquake struck Sylmar — about an hour’s drive from the epicenter of Tuesday’s earthquake — killing 65 people and severely damaging four hospital campuses. The consequences of that disaster are still being felt. A law passed in 1973 that ordered hospitals to strengthen their most vulnerable buildings has had unintended consequences across the state. To Nancy Skinner, a state senator in the East Bay, the seismic safety law has been used as an excuse for a vital acute-care hospital, the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, to shut down services at its Berkeley location. The hospital cites financial difficulty in funding the mandated retrofit, whose deadline has been pushed back several times and is now 2020. (There is also a 2030 deadline for buildings to be able to not only withstand an earthquake, but also remain operational.) Officials with Sutter Health, the hospital system that runs the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, has reassured locals that services will remain intact and that the center will relocate several miles south to Oakland. But Ms. Skinner said the move — which will result in some ambulances and patients having to use one of the most congested highways in America — would have an “extreme” impact on her constituency. The hospital controversy underscores a recurring problem in California: Residents want safer buildings, but they fear the more immediate consequences of costly renovations.","Thursday: The effects of a 1973 law that are still being felt, new policies on campus sexual misconduct, and a special escort to kindergarten.",2018-08-30T12:57:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Costs of Making Buildings Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/california-today-earthquake-retrofit-hospitals.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/briefing/30calitoday-bates/30calitoday-bates-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1
Jess Joho,"""It is considered enlightening and therapeutic to think about death for a few minutes a day,"" Anthony Bourdain says in the preview for the final episode of Parts Unknown, Season 11. ""Life is but a dream."" As the world continues to mourn the esteemed late travel documentarian, so too must we say goodbye to the TV series that made us feel not only closer to him, but to the world at large. The last episode of the eleventh season of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown airs on CNN this Sunday, July 24, at 9 p.m. As of now, it is still unclear whether CNN will air Season 12 of the show, which Bourdain was in the midst of filming at the time of his death. SEE ALSO: Anthony Bourdain, TV personality and chef, is dead at 61 The trailer serves as yet another acute reminder of what made Bourdain so special — going above and beyond the usual approach of most travel shows. Bourdain was known for immersing audiences in the lives and cultures that made up every place he visited. Rather than the more exploitative type of TV tourism, Bourdain insisted on bringing viewers to lesser known and marginalized locales. He might've been the one with his name in the show's title, but he always served as a conduit to showcase other people's stories. The final episode of Season 11 follows Bourdain on his trip to Bhutan, described as as ""a hard-to-reach region in the Himalayas"" and an epicenter of spirituality. Judging from the sneak peek, it looks like the episode may provide viewers some much-needed sense of closure. Bourdain may be gone physically, but his legacy will clearly leave a permanent mark. And you can keep watching, too. Netflix has extended its agreement to keep previous episodes of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown on the streaming service.","""It is considered enlightening and therapeutic to think about death for a few minutes a day,"" Anthony Bourdain says in the preview for the final episode of Parts Unknown, Season 11.

KAREN ZRAICK,"In neighboring San Mateo County, officials say the housing stock — primarily single-family homes, many on picturesque cul-de-sacs — lags far behind demand. Many residents who have been forced to move farther inland now face grueling commutes to their jobs. “We’re the epicenter of the affordability crisis we’re seeing in the hotter markets throughout the U.S.,” said Ken Cole, the county’s director of housing. “What it means on the ground is that teachers, first responders, people who grew up here of average income are being forced out by the high prices,” he said. He called for building new, higher-density housing along rail lines. Others, including Mr. Walker, say the state should abolish a state law that limits rent control and consider other steps to cool the overheated market. “The very success of the place undermines the viability of life for at least the lower half, if not the lower two-thirds,” Mr. Walker said. “And those are the people who get forgotten in the narrative of the glamour of tech changing the world.” Kate Hartley, director of the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, said high construction costs and low federal funding had added to the challenges of keeping low- and middle-income people in the city. “What makes the Bay Area great is its diversity, its creative and innovative economy, and its free spirit,” she said. “But the harder it is to house our artists, teachers, restaurant workers, health care providers,” she added, “the more we put that great spirit and strong economy at risk.”","Houses near the Bay Bridge in picturesque, but prohibitively pricey, San Francisco.

MICHAEL SCHULMAN,"When she returned to Chattanooga two years later, she reluctantly enrolled at her fathers university, but by then her worldview was too wide. Restless, she transferred to Georgia State University, where she was less interested in class than in the burgeoning drag scene in Atlanta, which she called the mecca of the gay South. There, she met RuPaul Charles, an ambitious glamour puss two years her senior. They became go-go dancers for a local new wave band, the Now Explosion, dressing themselves in thrift-store exotica. We were frequently evicted, occasionally working at Popeyes chicken you know, street kids, essentially, Bunny said. At one point, Ru and I were homeless together, and we went with whoever would take us in after the club night was over. We were flashy trash. In 1983, she followed RuPaul to New York City, where for a time they shared an apartment in the still ungentrified meatpacking district. The epicenter of East Village drag was the Pyramid Club on Avenue A, and RuPaul and Lady Bunny (as she now called herself) became in-house queens, go-go dancing for $40 a night. Her first time performing, she said, I did a rousing lip-sync of I Will Survive and fell halfway through it, lost my wig, and lost a shoe. But theres that little lull in the music right before the end, and somehow I got up, got my wig back on and finished the number with one shoe. One night after the club closed, Bunny and some fellow revelers sauntered into nearby Tompkins Square Park. We started clowning on the stage in front of a few homeless people who were sick of our yelling and trying to sleep at 5 a.m., she said. And we just came up with the idea to parody Woodstock and do it as Wigstock.

JILL COWAN,"Mr. Schreiner said he often relied on the Theodore Payne Foundations wildflower hotline although its season officially kicks off in March, so it hasnt started putting out weekly reports.
Of course, the flip side to all this flexibility is that in places like Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, which has come to be known as the super bloom epicenter, reservable campsites might already be booked up. Lodging in Borrego Springs, too, is most likely to be jammed.
The nice thing about Anza-Borrego, Mr. Schreiner said, is that as long as you follow certain guidelines, you can pretty much camp wherever you want, within the park.
Alternatively, you can always plan to hike a great wildflower trail (like one of these) whenever youre available to camp and appreciate whatever you see.
No matter what, Mr. Schreiner said, be a responsible user of the outdoors. It may be tempting to plunk down right in the middle of a vast blooming field for the perfect shot, but dont crush the flowers. And stay as close to established paths as you can.

Niniek Karmini and Stephen Wright / AP,"(PALU, Indonesia) Desperation exploded into anger Tuesday in the town closest to the epicenter of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit parts of Sulawesi island four days ago, with residents begging Indonesia's president to help them as hungry survivors crawled into stores and grabbed boxes of food. ""Pay attention to Donggala, Mr. Jokowi. Pay attention to Donggala,"" yelled one resident in footage broadcast on local television, referring to President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo. ""There are still a lot of unattended villages here."" Most of the attention so far has focused on the biggest affected city, Palu, home to 380,000 people with considerable damage. The confirmed death toll was raised to 1,234 on Tuesday afternoon, but national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference in Jakarta that the communities of Sigi and Balaroa have not been counted yet, meaning the toll is likely to rise. Donggala and other outlying areas have received little assistance largely due to impassable roads. Donggala's administration head Kasman Lassa said residents should take only food staples from shops. ""Everyone is hungry and they want to eat after several days of not eating,"" Lassa said. ""We have anticipated it by providing food, rice, but it was not enough. There are many people here. So, on this issue, we cannot pressure them to hold much longer."" Desperation was visible everywhere among victims receiving little aid. In Palu, signs propped along roads read ""We Need Food"" and ""We Need Support,"" while children begged for cash in the streets and long lines of cars snarled traffic as people waited for fuel. Teams were searching for trapped survivors under destroyed homes and buildings, including a collapsed eight-story hotel in the city, but they needed more heavy equipment to clear the rubble. Many people were believed trapped under shattered houses in Balaroa, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently, Nugroho said. ""I and about 50 other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,"" resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding her house was destroyed. In the Petobo neighborhood, the quake caused loose, wet soil to liquefy, creating a thick, heavy mud that resulted in massive damage. ""In Petobo, it is estimated that there are still hundreds of victims buried in mud,"" Nugroho said. Residents who found loved ones alive and dead over the weekend expressed frustration that it took rescue teams until Monday to reach Petobo. The magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck at dusk Friday and generated a tsunami said to have been as high as 6 m (nearly 20 ft.) in places. About 3,000 residents flocked to Palu's airport Monday, trying to board military aircraft or one of the few commercial flights using the facility only partially operating due to damage. Video showed some of them screaming in anger because they were not able to get on a departing military plane. ""We have not eaten for three days!"" one woman yelled. ""We just want to be safe!"" Nearly 50,000 people have been displaced from their homes in Palu alone, Nugroho said, and hospitals were overwhelmed. The Indonesian air force confirmed that a Hercules aircraft carrying an unspecified number of survivors was able to leave Palu for South Sulawesi's capital of Makassar. In addition, more than 100 police officers from the capital, Jakarta, were sent to Palu and additional Hercules aircraft carrying soldiers and supplies, including food and water, from east Java were en route, local television reported. President Widodo authorized the acceptance of international help, Nugroho said Monday, adding that generators, heavy equipment and tents were among the most-needed items. The European Union and about 10 countries have offered assistance, including the United States and China, he said. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday that his government had given $360,000 to help victims and was in talks with Indonesian authorities about a second round of aid. The initial funds would go to the Indonesian Red Cross for the most obvious emergency aid needs, such as tarpaulins. The coastline at Palu was strewn with rubble and a few brightly colored cargo containers poking out of the water. Buildings near the water were ruined shells. The arches of a large yellow bridge rested in the water and eerie drone footage showed a Ferris wheel, untouched, on a beach scraped bare by the waves. Rescuers searching a collapsed building Monday night were able to remove 38-year-old Sapri Nusin alive from the rubble. He was talking to his rescuers as they took him away but his condition was not known. In the Petobo neighborhood, Edi Setiawan said he and his neighbors rescued children and adults, including a pregnant woman. His sister and father, however, did not survive. ""My sister was found embracing her father,"" he said. ""My mother was able to survive after struggling against the mud and being rescued by villagers."" Indonesia is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. A powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August, and two moderate quakes occurred near an eastern island on Tuesday. The earthquakes 15 minutes apart reportedly damaged a bridge on the island of Sumba, but no tsunami warning was issued and no other damage was immediately reported. The temblors occurred nearly 1,600 km (990 miles) south of Palu. The vast archipelago is home to 260 million people on more than 17,000 islands that stretch a distance similar to that between New York and London. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas, making access difficult in the best of conditions.",Desperation exploded into anger in the town closest to the epicenter of the earthquake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi island four days ago,2018-10-02T07:50:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Survivors of Indonesia’s Devastating Earthquake Grow Desperate as Death Toll Exceeds 1,200",http://time.com/5412314/indonesia-earthquake-tsunami-death-toll-rises-sulawesi/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ap18275243283273.jpg?w=720,time,Time,epicenter,1
Ed Cara,"An outbreak of severe bleeding linked to tainted synthetic weed products continues to worsen. Illinois health officials reported this week that a third person has died soon after taking the drugs. As of Tuesday, there have been 114 reported cases of what’s now being called “synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy” within the state. Symptoms have included bleeding from the eyes, ears, and gums, especially heavy bleeding during a period for women, and coughing or urinating blood. The earlier two deaths involved men in their 20s, while the latest victim was a man in his 40s. “Each day we’ve seen the number of cases rise,” said Nirav D. Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health [IDPH], in a statement. “Synthetic cannabinoids are unsafe. They are not regulated and people don’t know what chemicals may be in them, like rat poison. While efforts are underway to get the contaminated drugs out of circulation, it’s possible they could re-emerge. We urge people not to use synthetic cannabinoids now or ever.” The working theory is that these products, sold under names such as K2 and Spice, have been laced with rat poison. Several patients in Illinois have tested positive for brodifacoum, the main ingredient of many rodenticides. Brodifacoum blocks the effects of vitamin K in the body, including our ability to properly clot blood. Its potency is so well known that it’s often referred as “super-warfarin”—an allusion to the common blood thinner. At this point, though, it’s still not known how or why these products have rat poison in them. Synthetic weed products operate in murky legal territory. They’re sold as smokable herbs that are sprayed with chemicals meant to legally mimic the high of traditional marijuana, or as mixtures that can be vaped. But the exact formula of these products is often a mystery, as drug manufacturers scramble to avoid bans on specific ingredients passed by states or the federal government. And while the recent outbreak is the first time that bleeding has ever been associated with synthetic weed use, these products are already known to cause temporary psychosis, hallucinations, and sometimes death. Illinois has been the epicenter of the outbreak, though health officials elsewhere have begun to alert doctors, hospitals, and coroners to keep an eye out for cases. According to an outbreak alert released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least four other states—Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, and Wisconsin—have seen a combined five patients visit an emergency room with similar symptoms as of last week. The CDC has also sent a team to work together with the IDPH, while police are conducting their own separate investigations.

Brian Heater,"Amazon has acquired Boulder, Colo.-based warehouse robotics startup Canvas Technology, TechCrunch has learned. The deal makes a lot of sense from the outside, adding another important piece to Amazon Robotics’ growing portfolio of fulfillment center machines.
Amazon confirmed the acquisition with TechCrunch. “We are inspired by Canvas Technologys innovations, and share a common vision for a future where people work alongside robotics to further improve safety and the workplace experience,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Canvas Technologys fantastic team to keep inventing for customers.”
Founded in 2015, Canvas has already showcased some impressive technologies, including a fully autonomous cart system that positions the startup as a direct competitor with the likes of Bay Area-based Fetch. The startup raised a $15 million Series A led by Playground Global.
The Canvas Autonomous Cart was on display at Playgrounds open house roughly this time last year, doing an impressive job avoiding people and obstacles in the crowded space. The system utilizes 3D imaging and an in-house software solution that can be applied to other hardware essentially operating like a self-driving car in a warehouse setting.
Canvas should make a nice addition to Amazon Robots offerings. The division was created after the companys 2012 acquisition of Kiva Systems, whose shelving robotics now serve as a kind of robotic epicenter to Amazons many fulfillment centers.
On our recent tour of the companys JFK8 in Staten Island, the company noted that it currently has some 100,000 systems deployed across 25 fulfillment centers. That number is a combination of Amazons own systems, along with devices from third parties, including Japanese industrial giant, Fanuc. Clearly, however, the company is looking to put its own stamp on the systems going forward in a push to increase delivery efficiency through automation.
Safety has been a big factor, as well. It always is with these sorts of collaborative robotics, of course, but Amazons fulfillment centers have a built-in extra layer of scrutiny. Earlier this year we got a sneak peek at the companys robotic safety vest, designed to give employees an added layer of protection when entering the fenced-off section of the floor that sports the Kiva systems.
Canvas, on the other hand, brings its own built-in safety with its autonomous vision system. The hardware is designed to more directly interact with workers on the floor. Its easier to imagine the company adopting the technology for some of its existing systems, as well.
Notably, Canvas co-founder and CTO Nima Keivan will be onstage at our Robotics + AI event next week in Berkeley, where he will no doubt be able to provide some extra insight for his robotics startup panel.","Amazon has acquired Boulder, Colo.-based warehouse robotics startup Canvas Technology, TechCrunch has learned.

Suyin Haynes,"Protests have erupted in Tunisia this week after a journalist died after setting fire to himself, calling for revolt amid the country’s struggling economic situation and high unemployment rate. The death of Abderrazak Zorgui, 32, on Monday sparked protests in Kasserine, a town in the country’s west, leading to violent clashes and concern across the country, the Associated Press reports.
Police reportedly fired teargas on demonstrators that blocked roads and threw stones at the authorities. A spokesman for Tunisia’s Interior Ministry said Tuesday that six police officers had been injured and several people were arrested during Monday night’s protests. Similar unrest was reported elsewhere in protests Tuesday night. Here’s what to know about the latest unrest in the North African nation, which became the epicenter of the Arab Spring in December 2010.
What Caused the Protests
Zorgui, a television correspondent, posted a video online before his death describing his frustration at high unemployment rates in Tunisia and his disappointment eight years on from the Arab Spring revolution. “For the sons of Kasserine who have no means of subsistence, today I start a revolution. I am going to set myself on fire,” Zorgi said in the video, according to Agence France-Presse.
A provincial town, Kasserine’s high poverty levels and threats from nearby extremist groups are emblematic of Tunisia’s socio-economic problems, with the country’s wider economic growth remaining weak since the revolution. Kasserine is also the hometown of another prominent protester, Husseini Kalai, who survived his own self-immolation attempt in January 2011 and was profiled by TIME nearly five years later.
Zorgui’s death has sparked widespread anger, with the Tunisian National Journalists’ Union calling for action in response to his death and laying partial culpability for the tragedy at the hands of the state through its failure to tackle corruption. His form of suicide through self-immolation was also reminiscent of the death of Mohammed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor who set himself alight in the town of Sidi Bouzid in December 2010 in protest caused by systematic unfair treatment he received from local police. Bouazizi’s death would go on to spark nationwide protests in outrage at the wider lack of opportunity, transparency and democracy in Tunisia and proved to be the catalyst for the Arab Spring, a series of anti-government protests that rippled across more than a dozen countries in the region and resulted in the ouster of four governments.
Rising Political Tensions
Tunisia has been upheld as one of the few countries to emerge from the Arab Spring having undergone a democratic transition, with free and fair parliamentary elections taking place in 2011 and 2014 as well as presidential elections in 2014. A collection of Tunisian advocates for democracy even won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 for their work to maintain stability in the country in the years following the Arab Spring.
But recent events show just how fragile that stability is. Municipal elections in mid-2018 offset the balance of the country’s governing coalition, setting off a power struggle within the ruling party of President Béji Caïd Essebsi and the suspension of Prime Minister Youssef Chahed. Tensions between the two men have also been fueled in part by the rapid rise within their Nidaa Tounes party of the president’s son, Hafedh Béji Caïd Essebsi, particularly in the lead-up to presidential elections slated for late 2019.
Essebsi also recently announced an end to the long-standing partnership between Nidaa Tounes and the powerful Islamist Ennahda party, who hold the majority of parliamentary seats. Analysts have noted that Nidaa Tounes has not delivered significant reform but a conservative transition, displaying little real legislative power and facing accusations of nepotism along the way.
The Letdown of the Arab Spring
Amid this political turmoil, voter turnout at the polls has decreased. Observers also note that numbers and frequency of street protests are on the rise, based on dissatisfaction at the broken promises of the revolution, as Zorgui voiced before his death.
High profile terrorist attacks rocked the country in 2015 and hurt its lucrative tourism industry. Unemployment remains high at over 15% (higher than the period immediately before the Arab Spring), according to Bloomberg. Inflation hit its highest level in 28 years in June rising to 7.8.%. While the government is facing pressure from the International Monetary Fund to shrink its public sector, it faces opposing resistance from unions, civil servants and young people concerned about the social costs of these reforms.
With youth unemployment hitting 36% last year amid a stagnant economy and a political environment plagued by infighting, the frustrations and anger of the younger generations in particular in Tunisia is not dissimilar to the pre-revolution days, palpable in the multiple strikes, street protests and demonstrations held over the past year. Reports have suggested that some protesters are seeking to create Tunisia’s own version of the “gilet jaunes,” or “yellow jackets,” movement that has swept France in recent weeks.
In 2011, TIME named “The Protester” as the annual Person of the Year, calling fruit vendor Bouazizi’s death “the final straw” in Tunisia. As Zorgui was buried in Kasserine on Tuesday before the evening’s protests, the full impact of his death isn’t yet clear, but the promises of the revolution in Tunisia remain unfulfilled for many.

The epicenter of a 1986 Palm Springs quake of magnitude 5.9 — the largest in theCoachella Valley since a magnitude 6.0 quake rocked Desert Hot Springs in 1948 — was less than 10 miles east of the most recent quakes, seismologists said. Though scores of Southern Californians felt the predawn quakes, Jones assured residents that temblors of this size are fairly common statewide and are representative of normal California earthquake activity. No reports of injuries or damage was reported immediately after the earthquakes. City News Service contributed to this report. This story is developing.

Aimée Lutkin,"California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area. In theory, that should give you a little time to prepare for the earth moving. Heres what to do with those extra seconds. And it may be only a matter of seconds, according to the L.A. Times. The speed with which people receive that phone buzz relates to how close they are to the quakes epicenter. However, that could make all the difference, since you have a little time to get out of the way of potential falling objects, for instance. This is what you should do: While Driving Pull over! That might be easy, but its also advised that you avoid bridges, overpasses, signs, and power lines. Thats a taller order out on the highway, and maybe something to think about on your daily commute. Where would you pull over? Once youve stopped, set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. While Walking Around This is also an issue of finding a spot to stand away from things like power lines, walls, buildings, or other things that could drop on top of you. Remember, falling debris could also come from the side. The more open space there is around you, the better. Drop to the ground, cover your head, and hold on. While In Bed Unless youre under a skylight or something else likely to break on top of you, stay in your bed. Turn on your stomach and cover your head and neck with a pillow for protection from falling ceiling pieces. While At The Beach The danger on a beach is a possible tsunami. Dont take a chance just because theres been no warningget out of there. After the quake ends, walk inland or to high ground immediately. California offers tsunami maps to show which beaches are vulnerable to the big waves. If you cant get away, go into a concrete or steel-frame building. A tsunami can easily wipe out a wood-frame house. While At The Theater If youre at The Greek, for instance, you will want to get down in front of your seat and cover your head and neck. Be careful while exiting after the quake, as debris could still fall from above. While Out With Kids If youre holding an infant, press them against your chest, drop to the ground and cover them with your body like a cage. With mobile kids, the best position to take is on the ground on all fours, because that protects most of your vital organs. instruct them to drop down and take cover, if its available. If not, and youre inside, a corner of the room away from exterior walls and windows is the best place to hunker down. Do Not Run, Do Not Stand In A Doorway A lot of people get hurt while running during an earthquake. The warning system will hopefully give people a moment to do their running, but once the shaking starts, you should stop. Even if you make it to an exit, theres often a lot of debris around doorways. Old adobe houses that are unreinforced are safest in the doorway, but thats about it for most structures. In fact, standing in a doorway can be more dangerous, because that door will slam right on you during the quake. Its time to put that common misconception about earthquake safety to bed.","California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area.

ELIZA SHAPIRO,"Brad Lander, the City Councilman who represents Park Slope and a former M.S. 51 parent, is one of the most vocal integration advocates on the Council, making him an effective booster of the plan. The neighborhood’s role as an epicenter of the test refusal movement has made it an obvious place to experiment with scrapping screened admissions. “I don’t believe that any 10-year-old should have to go through a fourth grade year where they are feeling pressure for grades or pressure to never be late,” said Liz Phillips, the principal of Public School 321 in Park Slope, a high-performing elementary school. “We had kids coming to school sick because they were scared that an absence would impact their ability to get into certain schools,” she said. Michael Perlberg, the principal of Middle School 839 in Kensington, which opened in 2015 as the only non-screened middle school in the district, said his first graduating class is headed to some of the city’s top high schools. “They created beautiful work, their writing and mathematics skills kept pace,” he said. “We see it, it actually happened.” And while the plan to change middle school admissions in Manhattan’s District 3 was met with some vocal opposition, there has been little public resistance to the District 15 plan. Mr. Lander said his office has received only a few dozen emails about the proposal, most of them supportive, and a representative for WXY said the firm had received very little private pushback. Neal Zephyrin, a member of a working group of parents, educators, students and Department of Education officials, said he was confident that “there are more people in favor of this plan than those opposed.” Some Red Hook and Sunset Park residents have raised questions about the plan’s potential to exacerbate gentrification and whether their children would be welcome in mostly white schools. Naila Rosario, who sends her children to Sunset Park schools, said a few of her neighbors told her they don’t believe their schools needed more white students to improve. “They say, ‘my school is already diverse, we have Ecuadorians, Puerto Ricans, Chinese students,’” she said.","The plan for District 15 — which includes Park Slope, Sunset Park and Red Hook — would scrap the screened admissions process for middle school students and replace it with a lottery.",2018-08-23T20:13:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","De Blasio Is Stalled on School Integration, but Brooklyn Parents Have a Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/nyregion/brooklyn-district-15-schools-diversity-lottery.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/nyregion/24DISTRICT/00DISTRICT-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1

In 2018, Twitch Prime members were able to claim up to $3,000 worth of complimentary in-game content across a spectrum of the years top titles, including the ever-growing battle royale shooter Apex Legends. A whole year of Nintendo Switch Online which has the ability to supply users with unforgettable online memories and gameplay experiences within the hottest Nintendo releases is maybe the most valuable gift that Twitch Prime has announced to date. So, what does this mean for Twitch Prime rewards, say, a few years down the road?
Were always looking for ways to surprise and delight members with gaming benefits theyll love, and a free year of Nintendo Switch Online felt like a no-brainer, Evans wrote. Members can always expect free games, in-game loot for the biggest blockbusters, and a free Twitch channel subscription every month, but well also keep introducing new benefits and features that make gaming better with Twitch Prime.
Although no specifics were given, the idea that Twitch Prime wants to keep brainstorming new ways to demonstrate its value is a good sign that there are plenty of worthwhile goodies coming in the future. Twitch Prime is working to be the best deal in gaming, and it seems that its well on its way to snagging that title. 
Going forward, we plan to keep focusing on what our members tell us they care about in gaming, and giving them even more of what they love, Evans wrote.

With confidence, optimism, and a wish to give back to Yemen, he learned all he could about coffee — and went to find the farmers who could grow it for the world. Eggers captures the story in compelling detail, as barrier after barrier comes up and is overcome by Alkhanshali. It's not only a book about coffee. It's also about community, culture, and remembering your own history. As always, we ended the interview with some recommendations: - Dave Eggers recommended Jesmyn Ward's 2017 National Book Award-winning novel Sing, Unburied, Sing, saying, ""page after page, you're reading a classic. You just know it."" - Mokhtar Alkhanshali recommended Michelle Alexander's best-selling book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. "" That book really inspired me to do my work even more,"" he said. - MJ recommended ""The Recipe for Life,"" a short story by Michael Chabon that recently appeared in the New Yorker. "" It is exceptionally beautiful. I was all up in my feelings reading it on the train."" - Martha recommended Phantom Thread and the Black Panther soundtrack. - Peter recommended The Paper Menagerie and other Stories. It's great.

Laignee Barron,"Rescuers are scrambling to reach hundreds of trekkers stranded on a mountain in Indonesia after a massive earthquake triggered landslides. Early Sunday morning, a 6.4-magnitude quake rocked Lombok Island in Indonesia’s southeast, killing at least 14 people and injuring another 160. Not far from the epicenter, Mount Rinjani was hit with slides that blocked off escape routes, the BBC reports. Rescuers evacuated more than 800 tourists from the mountain, according to the Associated Press. Helicopters have been dispatched to search for another 266 who remain trapped. A Malaysian climber who was on a hiking trip to Lombok is reportedly among those killed. The tremor rattled the popular tourist destination just before 7 am local time, damaging thousands of homes. While the epicenter was located in Mataram, in northern Lombok, the quake was felt further afield, including 25 miles west in Bali. Dozens of aftershocks rippled through the area leading to falling debris and toppled concrete, which the country’s disaster agency said caused most of the fatalities. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency said it recorded over 130 aftershocks. “The tremors were strong – I noticed waves in the hotel pool,” BBC Marathi journalist Vinayak Gaikwad said from Gili Trawangan Island, about 4 miles away from the epicenter. “Thirty minutes later there was the first strong aftershock. The locals were worried because many of their structures are made from wood and bamboo,” he added. The quake triggered blackouts in at least two districts. Located in the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a chain of volcanoes and fault lines, Indonesia is particularly prone to seismic activity. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake near Sumatra prompted a tsunami and led to more than 230,000 deaths.",Rescuers are searching for more than 200 people believed to be stranded on a mountain,2018-07-30T05:50:13Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Hundreds Trapped, 14 Dead After a Massive Earthquake Struck an Indonesian Tourist Island",http://time.com/5352421/lombok-earthquake-hikers-trapped/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rtx6d77y.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1

ELIZA SHAPIRO,"Where insurgent national Democrats support charter schools, they do so carefully: Representative Jared Polis, the Colorado Democrat whom voters sent to the governors mansion on Tuesday, founded two charter schools. But he has made sure to criticize Ms. DeVoss vocal brand of school choice advocacy. Tuesdays results were compounded by other recent blows for charters in liberal states. In 2016, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum that would have expanded the states high-performing charter schools. Though backers poured $20 million into the race, it was no match for Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, progressive stars who opposed the initiative. Philanthropists tried again in California over the summer, when they spent $23 million to bolster the former Los Angeles mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the primary for governor. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, was easily beat by Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, who has been vague about the role of charters as he seeks to make California an epicenter of opposition to the Trump administration. Some advocates find a sliver of hope in the fact that even the most liberal Democrats acknowledge that charter schools are here to stay. Many opponents want to slow growth, not destroy charters. No matter how hostile some of the cities get to charters, the charters have endured, said Jeanne Allen, the chief executive of the Center for Education Reform, a national school choice advocacy group. In New York, the insurgent Democratic candidates criticism of charters was somewhat less central to their campaigns than their support for traditional public schools. And though most of those Democrats said they would reject any plan to expand charter schools, they are aware that charters are popular among some families in their own districts. You dont want to alienate anybody, said Alessandra Biaggi, who in the Democratic primary unseated one of the charter lobbys most reliable allies, State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, in a Bronx district. I understand why charter schools exist, I understand why they have come to the Bronx, I really get it. But weve got to focus on improving our public schools.",Mike Warboys led class at an Achievement First charter school in Brooklyn in 2017.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone. After a tsunami battered the island late last week, leaving at least 1,350 dead, a volcano has now erupted. Earlier this week, scientists forecast that Soputan, an active stratovolcano on the northeastern tip of the island, was showing signs of activity. On Wednesday, it sent an ash cloud towering nearly 20,000 feet above its summit. By night, lava was trickling down Soputans flanks. The volcano continues to be on a Level III alert, which is a watch and take precautions kind of alert, but not an evacuations are imminent one. Soputan has erupted a dozen times since 2000, so this isnt wholly a surprise. But it coming right after an earthquake that triggered a tsunami has people wondering if the geological phenomena are intertwined. The short answer: We dont know, but it seems unlikely. It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen, Kasbani, the head of Indonesias Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency who goes by only one name, said according to NBC News. Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti threw even more cold water on the speculation. Soputan had already been restless for months before the earthquake and the volcano is hundreds of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake, he said in an email to Earther. So, I invoke correlation =/= causation on this front. Indonesia is just that geologically active. Indeed, Indonesia is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world. The islands that make up the nation are home to dozens of active volcanoes owing to its proximity the edge of tectonic plates. That can allow magma to seep up from deep in the Earth to the surface more readily. This isnt the first eruption weve seen in Indonesia recently. In February, Mount Sinabung in Sumatra popped off, sending an extremely ominous-looking ash cloud towering over the countryside. Last November, Mount Agung on Bali did its thing, too. Of course, having regular eruptions is one thing. Having one follow a tsunami that already has people on edge is quite another.","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","An intensity map released by the US Geological Survey on January 14, 2018, indicates the epicenter of an earthquake near the coast of southern Peru. (Photo: USGS/HANDOUT, EPA-EFE) A powerful earthquake centered in the Pacific Ocean off Peru rocked a string of towns on the southern coast Sunday, killing at least two people and wounding scores more as it toppled homes and crumbled roads. President PedroPablo Kuczynski said he would visit the area later Sunday to view the damage and help provide aid to victims. The epicenter of the magnitude-7.1 quake, which struck at 4:18 a.m. local time, was about 25 miles southwest of Acarí, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Homes collapsed and power was lost in the cities of Acarí, Jaquí, Tanaca Yauza, Salamanca and Condesuyos and others, Acarí Mayor Jorge Alfonso De La Torre Velarde said. The U.S Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned of possible tsunami waves for areas of Peru's southern coast. The center later issued a bulletin saying no such waves were detected and that the threat had passed. Yamila Osorio, governor of the the Arequipa region that includes the devastated areas, said a 55-year old man was crushed by a rock in the coastal town of Yauca, 350 miles southeast of Lima. Twenty miles north of Yauca, another fatality was reported in the town of Bella Union, authorities told the Peruvian newspaper El Popular.

INDECI posted photos on Twitter of blankets, tents and other humanitarian aid being loaded on transport planes bound for the affected area. “There are several homes affected and it is possible that the count of victims and injured will rise,” Jorge Chavez, chief of Peru’s Civil Defense Institute, told Reuters. Mining is a major industry in the region, and a Health Ministry official initially announced that 17 people were missing in a mine. Authorities later said there had been no mining disruptions, however. Earthquakes are common along Peru's coast.

DAVID BROOKS,"As the authors of the Opportunity America report lay out the evidence, you see how the debate has evolved over the past few years. First, there used to be relatively little research attention paid to the working class at all. Now its the epicenter. Second, there used to be a silly debate over whether economics or culture explained social breakdown. Now these two elements are woven seamlessly together. Third, geography plays a much bigger role. Social problems are concentrated in specific places. The authors of this report dismiss the policy slogans coming from the extremes. Building a wall is not a policy. Universal basic income degrades the work ethic that is at the core of working-class life. Free college is a massive subsidy for the upper middle class. Instead, the authors come up with a broad left/right agenda that 70 percent of Republicans and Democrats could support: wage subsidies, improved parental leave, work requirements for some federal benefits, child care tax credits. I especially like their point that we have overemphasized four-year colleges as the only route to success. In 2016, the federal government spent $139 billion on post-secondary education and training. Only a sliver, 14 percent, went to career education and training. Private sector employers fetishize the college degree even where its unnecessary. Two-thirds of the job postings for production supervisors now require a college degree. But only 16 percent of the people currently holding those jobs have such a degree. One of the core questions before us is this: Who is going to lead this country? Is it perpetual outsiders like Trump, with no governing or policy competence, who say the establishments have forfeited all credibility? Or are there enough chastened members of establishments, who have governing experience, who acknowledge past mistakes, who take the time to reconnect with the country and apply their expertise in new ways? I dont know about you, Ill take a chastened establishment any day.

I’m a bit older, so I grew up with Moscow being the epicenter of the evil empire, and to actually be in Red Square is a really powerful experience. A tour of the Kremlin is highly advised as well. Getting an ice cream in the GUM department store is a Muscovite right of passage, and if you’re there, it’s seen as a disappointment if you don’t take advantage.”— ekimyllek “If you visit Moscow, you really should also try to get in a trip to St. Petersburg. Take the overnight train from Moscow. Note that when you buy a bunk, you are literally only buying that bunk. That means strangers will get put into the room with you if you don’t buy all the bunks in it. When my mom and I took the Red Star to St. Petersburg, two dudes got put in the room with us, one of which kindly and calmly informed us that he had a gun with him.”— mazzieD “I recommend getting a local sim card. The internet is way more reliable that what ever phone plan you brought with you. Make sure you are able to log into Uber before you arrive in Russia. When I switched sim cards, Uber kept sending my confirmation number to my old number.”— harviylopez “The Russian theater scene is very hardcore with lots of state sponsorship. I saw several productions there that put Broadway to shame, even watching in Russian (which I do not speak). MXAT and Satyricon are two of the best places to see shows. Unlike in the States, at any given time, a single theater will have up to a dozen shows performing in rep, so you could go see The Seagull on Thursday and Romeo and Juliet on Friday on the same stage.”— FKA Scooter “Learn to pronounce the Cyrillic alphabet. You might even look up why it’s called the Cyrillic alphabet. But for example Фото, ресторан, and супермаркет are the Russian words for photo, restaurant, and supermarket.”— dchall8 “Practice pronouncing, reading, listening to, and sounding out (connecting the letters to their sounds) any major destinations or other important key words / proper nouns. Hotel, airport, subway stations, etc. The more ways you can recognize a word, the better off you are. Youtube has plenty of videos that can help.”— Helena Glory “Apple Pay and others work pretty much everywhere. Don’t bring lots of cash and don’t show it in public. Uber works, so does Gett. You can also use Yandex Taxi, the local option. Never use taxis without apps. Never. Ever. You will be scammed.”— Kirion “I had some non-white fellow Americans that I knew, and the shit they dealt with [in Russia] was unreal. Likewise if you’re not straight and don’t want to pretend to be straight, or if you’re at all gender nonconforming or even just on the non-traditional side of gender presentation.”— miapps “Museums.

Over two decades ago, following the collapse of the traditional industries Bilbao was built on, the city was scarred with industrial wastelands, abandoned factories, and a community afflicted by unemployment and social tensions. Bilbao surprised the world (and raised a few eyebrows) with a unique idea to kickstart the city's regeneration, and they set out to build—not new factories or new roads—but instead a new center for modern art. Since then, the museum has attracted 19 million visitors and became the epicenter of the urban renewal that rippled through Bilbao.

Tampa Bay Times,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  An earthquake of at least magnitude 5.5 struck in southern Iran near the country's sole nuclear power plant on Thursday morning, shaking countries across the Persian Gulf. There was no immediate report of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck at 0634 GMT some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bushehr. That's home to the Bushehr Nuclear Power, the only operating nuclear power plant in the Islamic Republic. The USGS put the earthquake's magnitude at 5.5 while Iranian state television, citing officials, described the quake as a magnitude 5.9. Varying magnitudes are common immediately after a temblor. Iranian state TV, which put the earthquake's epicenter near the town of Kaki, did not report any damage at Bushehr plant, which has seen other earthquakes in the past and is built to resist damage from a temblor. Authorities later said the quake did not affect routine operations at the plant, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The Iran Red Crescent described the epicenter as being in a sparsely populated area. In Bahrain, an island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia, people said they felt the quake and evacuated from high-rise buildings. Some in Qatar also felt the quake and evacuated tall buildings in Doha's West Bay area. People in Kuwait City also felt the temblor. The USGS put the earthquake's depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) below the surface. Shallow earthquakes often have broader damage. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn't damaged at that time. In November, a major 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous region of Iran near the Iraqi border, killing over 530 people and injuring thousands in Iran alone. In Iraq, nine people were killed and 550 were injured, all in the country's northern Kurdish region. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Hussain al-Qatari in Kuwait City contributed to this report.","Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain Tampabay.com DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 5.5 earthquake has struck in southern Iran near a nuclear plant, shaking Bahrain and other areas around the …",2018-04-19T07:23:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Tampabay.com'}",Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain - Tampabay.com,http://www.tampabay.com/magnitude--quake-strikes-southern-iran-felt-in-bahrain-ap_world776eeab078ea43389d8563dd2acc31f8,http://www.tampabay.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/facebook_icon.png,,Tampabay.com,epicenter,1

ROBERTA SMITH,"Kingelez favored setbacks, “glass” curtain walls (mostly plastic) and scallops that defined his buildings’ shapes, as throughout “Etoile Rouge Congolaise.” Housing what he called the “High Multicultural Court of Wisdom,” this building centered on a turquoise medallion and the two low pink wings to either side, which together conjure a tricked-out army tank. Inverted pyramids were also frequent, most strikingly with the turquoise, red and cream “Stars Palme Bouygues,” which resembles the expanding chest of a superhero, or a figure by the Chicago Imagist Karl Wirsum. Kingelez has a bit of the outsider artist in his boastfulness, including suggestions of communicating with God, and in his belief that his work would result in ‘‘lasting peace, justice and universal freedom.” Photo Visitors study various Kingelez works at the show.

Credit Cole Wilson for The New York Times In addition his talent seemed to emerge fully formed. He was born in 1948 in the rural village of Kimbembele-Ihunga — later reimagined in a sculpture with high-speed trains and skyscrapers defined with gold metallic tape — and educated by Catholic priests in the final years of the Belgian Congo: a top student who excelled at calligraphy. (Many times tiny decorative elements of his pieces seem printed but are actually hand drawn, like the little black-on-white plaques beneath 40 windows of “Canada Dry,” a marvelous terra-cotta-colored piece from 1991.) Photo “Canada Dry,” 1991, a marvelous terra-cotta pseudo-Gothic confection made from paper, paperboard and other various found materials. Credit Cole Wilson for The New York Times In 1970, Kingelez traveled 370 miles to Kinshasa (formerly Léopoldville), like any kid with inchoate ambition seeking a larger life. He attended college, studying economics and industrial design, and taught in a secondary school for a few years. In 1978, he suddenly quit, dissatisfied but unfocused. After a month he said “I became obsessed with getting my hands on some scissors, a Gillette razor, and some glue and paper.” When he did he built a little house. “And this,” he told an interviewer with typical understatement “is what stopped the fatal hemorrhaging.” Photo Bodys Isek Kingelez in Kinshasa, 1990, in an outfit he made himself from a flag. Credit André Magnin, Paris The first two structures he made helped land him a job as a restorer at the country’s central museum, where he worked for six years, perfecting his skills both on the job and at home, working with materials meticulously scavenged. He took inspiration from the Art Deco buildings left by the Belgian colonials and also from the more bizarre structures ordered up, if not always completed, by the reigning dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power in 1965, changed the country’s name to Zaire in 1971 and began destroying its economy and infrastructure for the benefit of his family and coterie, eventually resulting in civil war and finally, in 1997, his ouster. This exhibition has been organized by Sarah Suzuki, curator in the department of drawings and prints, with Hillary Reder, curatorial assistant, and is accompanied by a beautifully designed catalog. Kingelez referred to his models as “extreme maquettes” while others call them super hybrids for their mixing of media, or propositions — ideas not intended for building. As with most utopian designs, one can imagine that if built, especially into whole cities, they would feel tyrannical. But as objects they are among the most distinctive and ambiguous creations in the histories of sculpture, architectural model-making and the decorative arts. They celebrate, criticize and satirize. Some make political points right up front; his models include a hospital for people suffering from AIDS, of which Kinshasa was an early epicenter; another is dedicated to Palestinians.

Ed Cara,"Illinois police have made the first arrests in connection to an ongoing outbreak of synthetic cannabinoid products responsible for hundreds of severe bleeding cases and at least three deaths. One person, who allegedly distributed the drugs, has been charged with homicide. Late last week, Pekin Police Department officials in Tazewell County, Illinois, announced they had arrested and charged 46-year-old Lonnie K. Smith with the drug-induced homicide of 47-year-old Anthony Phillips, as well as the unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Two other individuals—Rachel Spires, 30, and Richard Booth, 26—were also arrested and charged with aggravated battery and delivery or possession with intent to deliver. All three appeared in Tazwell County Court Friday and had their bonds set. “The distribution of these illegal drugs represent an unacceptable risk to public safety, and dealers must be held criminally responsible for their conduct. I wish to recognize the swift and effective investigation by the Pekin Police Department,” Tazewell County State’s Attorney Stu Umholtz told NBC affiliate 25 News. Prosecutors allege that Smith sold synthetic cannabinoids to both Anthony Phillips and his girlfriend on April 7. In the middle of the morning the next day, Phillips woke up vomiting blood and felt severe stomach pain, while his girlfriend also experienced symptoms. Both were hospitalized, and Phillips died on April 9. Prosecutors said the woman told Pekin police that Smith was Phillips’ regular dealer. When police visited Smith, he reportedly confessed that he sold K2—one of the many product names under which synthetic cannabinoids are sold—and that he dumped the rest of his supply in a nearby dumpster. According to a statement by the Pekin Police Department, officers found 3,500 packets of K2 in the dumpster, or more than 7,000 grams of the drug. Lab testing revealed that the K2 found contained FUB-AMB, a synthetic cannabinoid that the DEA recently and temporarily classified as an illegal Schedule I controlled substance (the same category that covers drugs like heroin and cocaine). Spires and Booth are also alleged to have sold products containing FUB-AMB that resulted in severe hemorrhaging among numerous people. Even before this outbreak, FUB-AMB has caused dangerous complications. Meant to mimic the high of traditional cannabis, it’s many times more potent. It was behind an outbreak of “zombielike” behavior that struck 33 people in a Brooklyn neighborhood in 2016, 18 of whom were hospitalized. It’s also believed to have contributed directly to at least one death. Synthetic cannabinoids in general have been associated with temporary psychosis, hallucinations, and cardiovascular problems. The current outbreak of “synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy” cases, in which people have bled from their ears and eyes after injesting the drugs, is thought to be caused by products laced with rat poison. But it’s unknown at this time how the contamination occurred in the first place, or whether it was intentional. Pekin police stated that no further information will be released at this time, citing an ongoing investigation. And the Tazewell County State Attorney’s Office has not immediately responded to a request for a comment. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, as of Monday there have been 131 cases within the state, which is thought to be the epicenter of the outbreak. Isolated cases have been seen in four other states, however, according to the CDC: Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Anyone who experiences unexplained bruising, or bleeding from the ears, nose, gums, or ears, or heavy bleeding during a period, after taking these products should seek immediate medical help by having someone take you to the hospital or by calling 911.","Illinois police have made the first arrests in connection to an ongoing outbreak of synthetic cannabinoid products responsible for hundreds of severe bleeding cases and at least three deaths.

KELUNDRA SMITH,"Ms. LaTrice has made it her mission to change that. Several months ago she contacted Franklin Sirmans, director of the Pérez Art Museum Miami (known as PAMM), a contemporary art museum, about presenting the womens work and hosting a brunch during fair week. While Mr. Sirmans was unfamiliar with Ms. LaTrices group, he has had his eye on Atlanta as an epicenter of black culture since he studied at Morehouse College there. With sponsorships and crowd funding support, the group headed to Miami. In addition to Ms. Johnson and Ms. Kisa, it included the painters Ariel Dannielle, Ebony Black and Sachi Rome; the multimedia artists Christa David and Shon Pittman; the graphic artists Ayanna Smith and Jasmine Nicole Williams; and the photographer Evelyn Quiñones. Their work would be on display on video screens at PAMM during Art Basel. Kate Atwood, executive director of ChooseATL, a program of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the city had a long way to go before it could compete with New York and Los Angeles in creating a supportive ecosystem for artists. (ChooseATL followed the artists journeys to Art Basel Miami Beach on its streaming channel, THEA.) We need to make sure that were not losing that talent anymore, Ms. Atwood said. Signs of progress made by nonwhite artists have filled the news, from rising museum acquisitions to new curatorial positions to the top prices gained recently in auctions. Yet African-American artists and curators interviewed for this article said progress comes slowly, with many barriers to success. According to the Atlanta Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau there are 50 art galleries for a city of nearly 500,000 people in a state that bounces between 48th and 50th in arts funding. The artists spoke of limited access to the citys cultural gatekeepers, who are mostly white. In addition, many black women who are the primary breadwinners for their families cannot afford the studio fees, ranging up to $1,000 per month, that would grant them access to a peer network. An artist herself, Ms. LaTrice, 29, understands their struggles. Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., she moved to New York and then to Atlanta after earning her masters degree in womens history from Sarah Lawrence College. She had no network or connections before she formed TILA. Today her studio trains women how to write a strong artist statement, develop a CV and shoot their work professionally, not just on an iPhone. Her studio is a resource so they dont feel alone, she said.","The artists Grace Kisa, Angela Davis Johnson and Evelyn Quiñones at TILA Studios in suburban Atlanta before their recent trip to Art Basel Miami Beach, where they hoped for a break.",2018-12-11T16:16:08Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Overlooked in Atlanta, Black Female Artists Try Miami",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/arts/design/atlanta-black-female-artists-art-basel-miami-beach.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/arts/16artbasel-miami1/16artbasel-miami1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1

Sean Captain,"Though an epicenter of displacement in San Francisco, the Mission District grips tenaciously to some of its old character and charm on the grand old boulevard of Mission Street. Dollar stores, discount clothing shops, and affordable tacquerias still occupy many storefronts, while Spanish chatter fills the sidewalks. The pavement is especially packed and diverse on Tuesday night as a dense crowd wraps around the corner of Mission and 23rd streets. Graying activists in crunchy casual wear mingle with the grunge-meets-hipster look of the young San Francisco left, and the crowd is racially and ethnically mixed. A couple of activists are holding up Palestinian flags. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [Photo: Jesse Korman /Wikimedia Commons] They are waiting to enter Gray Area, an arts and technology center founded by self-described “queer Mexican woman” Josette Melchor. It’s been housed in a converted 1940s movie theater since 2014, just as the tsunami of gentrification was sweeping in. The evening’s event is hosted by San Francisco’s Democratic Socialists, Latino Democratic Club, Berniecrats, and the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club. It’s a ground-zero constituency for the evening’s star speaker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who blew past most expectations to win the Democratic primary for her New York City House congressional district in late June. Her victory is a near guarantee that next year she will become the youngest woman (by then at age 29) to enter Congress. With her own rapid ascent, Ocasio-Cortez preaches urgency when it comes to taking action on the important issues. “When they told me that I had to wait my turn–nah,” she says of the Democratic Party establishment. “Because we have been waiting all of American history for justice, and we’re not going to wait anymore,” she says, for action on climate change, “voting rights,” and better education. “If it’s possible now, we are morally obliged to do it now,” she says, over whooping sounds and heavy applause. Though she was in the heart of the tech sector—riven by controversies over its lack of gender and racial diversity, a business model that thrives on collecting personal data on its users, and an agnostic attitude when it comes to selling its products to companies and governments around the world—Ocasio-Cortez didn’t mention any of those issues, choosing to focus on the big picture. Related: Can 2018’s progressive candidates overcome the power of money in politics? Immediate action isn’t the same as immediate electoral victory. The “blue wave” that Democratic activists hope will sweep them into control of Congress in November is far from certain. And the far-left will be just one component of any wave. Democratic leaders have long held the far-left at a distance for fear of alienating middle-American moderates who ultimately decide the presidency and many other elections. [Photo: Sean Captain] Seeing Obama’s legacy–on healthcare, the environment, immigration, consumer rights, internet policy–being erased by the Republican leadership, Democrats may want to just get anyone in office who can stop the bleeding. Ocasio-Cortez pushes a nearly opposite approach: Double down on the progressive agenda and expand the base of believers who will vote for it–even if that takes a while. “We gotta be real clear about what our message is. We gotta be really clear what we’re about, because we’re gonna reclaim this party,” she says, for the working class, people of color, LGBT people, and immigrants. “They stay home because they don’t feel that we are fighting hard enough for them. So the answer to get those people to vote is to fight harder.” Related: Meet the Silicon Valley socialists who are pushing a tech worker uprising As the rock star of Democratic Socialism, Ocasio-Cortez speaks for seemingly unthinkable reforms. Universal healthcare, though standard procedure in much of the world, has been a nearly a century-long losing proposition in the U.S., with even Obama’s timid step toward it now being wiped out under the Trump administration. Universal basic income is a trendy topic among wonks of varied political allegiance, but it remains anathema to those who cherish the bootstrap mythology of American enterprise. A government jobs guarantee sounds downright Soviet. [Photo: Sean Captain] Pushing for all of this, all at once, might not be a winning strategy in the short term, Ocasio-Cortez cautions. But the millennial frames these big goals as a legacy for her grandkids. “They feel it’s zero-sum, it’s win or lose,” she says of the Democratic establishment. “And if you lost, it wasn’t worth doing it at all.” But if the cause gains more adherents each election cycle, it’s succeeding, Ocasio-Cortez contends. “You lose by a little bit, you raise our organizing,” she says. “You lose by a little bit, that next cycle, it’s ours.” “We need to have a multi-cycle, long-game approach,” she says.","At a San Francisco rally, the Democratic Socialist candidate looked at the big picture: “We have been waiting all of American history for justice, and we’re not going to wait anymore.” Though an epicenter of displacement in San Francisco, the Mission District…",2018-08-01T17:30:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fastcompany.com'}",Ocasio-Cortez skips tech controversy and focuses on generational reform,https://www.fastcompany.com/90212402/ocasio-cortez-skips-tech-controversy-and-focuses-on-generational-reform?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcompany%2Fheadlines+%28Fast+Company%29,"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/08/p-1-alexandria.jpg",,Fastcompany.com,epicenter,1

AISHA HARRIS,"I think what happens with a quote-unquote “brawny” action show, people say, “Oh well, great, if you have a female director she’s going to be great with the emotions, but then when it comes to the camera, when it comes to action, she’s not going to know what to do with it.” And that’s just really — I mean, it’s frankly [expletive]. But, if you want to see real change, it has to start in places where people wouldn’t expect to see a female director, and that was one of the things that was important to me, my co-executive producer this season Aïda [Mashaka] Croal and Tom Lieber, one of the drama heads at Marvel television. We were also very much supported by Netflix on this. So six of our 13 directors are women, and the thing is, they all defy that stereotype, because if anyone wants to say that they can’t direct action, look at Episode 4 in terms of our signature kick with Bushmaster, really handing Luke Cage’s [expletive]. That was Salli’s episode, and that actual shot was her idea, because initially the script called for just a devastating punch. And then she called from the set and said, “Look, we kind of worked things out with the coordinator, but I think this is a chance for a more signature moment.” And I pulled the trigger, said go for it, and bam: It’s the kick that we’re marketing the entire show around. With Bushmaster’s arrival as a new villain, he brings this facet of blackness that we didn’t see much of in Season 1: Caribbean culture. What kinds of discussions did you have in the writers’ room and on set when you were enfolding this into the narrative? Before even getting the room together when I was thinking about what the season could be about, I started looking through the various Marvel dossiers and looking through old issues of “Luke Cage” and when Bushmaster’s character came up, looking at his background, he’s from the Caribbean. And I said, perfect, that’s going to be our window to really talk about Jamaican culture. Even though I’m not Jamaican, I’ve always loved Jamaican culture because to me it’s the island of magic, it’s the island of politics, of resistance. At first, in talking to the powers that be, there was a little bit of resistance. There was, “Fine, he has a Jamaican background, but does he have to speak with a Jamaican accent? Could he be Jamaican-American? How are you going to connect it to Harlem? How are you going to connect it to the club?” And in trying to answer the questions for both Marvel and Netflix, it helped us in terms of the writers’ room of realizing here’s how we expand New York. Because Brooklyn has always kind of been the epicenter of Jamaican America, Brooklyn and Queens. So, this expands our universe outside of Harlem.","Cheo Hodari Coker, left, with Mike Colter on the set of “Marvel’s Luke Cage.” The show returns Friday for its second season on Netflix.",2018-06-21T22:32:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Ask a Showrunner: ‘Luke Cage’ Season 2: A New Villain and Respectability Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/arts/television/luke-cage-season-2-netflix.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/22/arts/22cage-showrunner1/22cage-showrunner1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1

Communication blackouts and blocked roads are hampering rescue efforts as Papua New Guinea works to get a better grasp of the damage wrought by a massive earthquake amid fears of its economic impact. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images Days after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the interior of Papua New Guinea, the death toll is continuing to rise as rescue workers strive to reach isolated communities despite blocked and damaged roads. Officials said that at least 31 people were killed by the quake and subsequent landslides, more than double the initial reports, and that the toll is expected to rise further, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wire service continued: ""Remote hamlets closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake in the Southern Highlands were buried, killing 13 people, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby in an email, citing a two-way radio call from a mission station in the region. ""Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi and the town of Tari 40 km (25 miles) from the epicenter, where aftershocks continue to be felt and people afraid their homes may yet collapse have been sleeping in their yards. "" 'Tari is completely shut down,' Mark Mendai, head of the district's Development Authority told Reuters by phone."" As NPR previously reported, the quake was followed by a number of aftershocks and landslides, and damage to phone lines made it difficult to immediately assess the scale of the disaster. Now blocked roads and cracked runways are continuing to hamper efforts to bring aid to affected communities. Damage to a road near Mendi in Papua New Guinea's highlands region, is shown on Feb. 27. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images ""Rescuers are still trying to reach some of the hardest-hit areas in the rugged and mountainous highland region of the Pacific nation,"" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR on Wednesday. There are concerns about the earthquake's economic impact as well as the human toll. Oil and gas production has been halted at several facilities, and work at coffee plantations and a gold mine has also been interrupted, The Associated Press reports. On Wednesday, the AP spoke to Southern Highlands Governor William Powi, who described the situation in dire terms: "" 'We are looking at massive, catastrophic havoc and destruction,' Powi said.... "" 'There are people who are traumatized, people in terrible devastation who have never felt this kind of destruction before,' Powi said. 'It has really brought a lot of fear into people's lives.... "" 'We need massive assistance... We need food, infrastructure maintenance, and to bring comfort to our people who are homeless and displaced.' "" Australia has promised to help fly in resources like tarps and water purification kits, deploying a C-130 transport plan to assist, the wire services report.","A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck in the country's isolated interior on Monday, triggering landslides.

,"A magnitude 5.3 earthquake was reported Thursday afternoon off the coast of California near Los Angeles. It was the largest earthquake to strike the Channel Islands region since a 6.0 temblor in 1981, Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson told the Los Angeles Times. No significant damage has been reported after a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in the Channel Islands region off the Southern California coast, but some bricks fell from a chimney at a historic ranch on one of the islands, according to the Associated Press. Channel Islands National Park spokeswoman Yvonne Menard told AP that the bricks fell Thursday at a ranch building on Santa Cruz Island that dates to the 1860s. Menard says the quake was felt by visitors and staff on the island. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers.

Sarah Perez,"LOLA, a subscription service delivering tampons and pads, and now other products, including condoms, lubricant, and feminine cleansing wipes, has closed on $24 million in Series B funding. While the startup touts its products’ “100% organic” nature, it’s also well-received because of the customization offered and its direct-to-consumer nature. The new round of financing was led by private equity firm Alliance Consumer Growth (ACG), with support from existing investors Spark Capital, Lerer Hippeau and Brand Foundry Ventures. To date, LOLA has raised $11.2 million, from investors including also BBG Ventures, 14W, the founders of Warby Parker and Harry’s, Sweetgreen, Bonobos, and Insomnia Cookies. Celebs like Serena Williams, Karlie Kloss, Lena Dunham, and Allison Williams have also invested. Launched in 2015, LOLA’s founders Alex Friedman and Jordana Kier had the idea to challenge industry giants, like Tampax and Playtex, with a 100% organic product. “We founded LOLA with a simple and seemingly obvious idea – as women, we shouldn’t have to compromise when it comes to our reproductive health,” explains Kier. “Like most women, we’d been using the same feminine care products since we were teenagers. But when we found out that brands – including the same ones we were loyal to all those years – aren’t required to disclose exactly what’s in their products, it made us wonder: what’s in our tampon?” “If we care about everything else we put in our bodies, products for our reproductive health shouldn’t be any different,” she states. LOLA’s tampons, pads and liners are made only with organic cotton, not synthetic fibers, like those used mainstream brands. Nor do they contain fragrances or dyes. The nature of its products appeal to consumers – especially, young millennial women – who are more conscious of the chemicals in their products, as well as those who want to buy organic for the environmental benefits. That said, there’s a bit of debate over how dangerous (or not) it is to use traditional feminine care products. Skeptics, including some doctors, insist there’s no threat from conventional products. But even women not concerned with buying organic may find LOLA appealing because of its model. Its subscription service lets you create a box with your own mix of tampon sizes (with or without applicators, which can be either cardboard or plastic). That’s something you can’t do when buying off the shelf. Plus, LOLA’s boxes aren’t any more expensive than those bought in the store. Its 18-count box of applicator tampons is $10 per month ; or it’s $9 each, if ordering two or three boxes per month. Non-applicator tampons are a dollar less. In addition, LOLA sells other period-related products, including an essential oil blend for cramps, a multi-vitamin that protects against PMS, and a first period starter kit. In May, the startup broadened its mission to become more of a female health company with the launch of SEX by LOLA. This product line includes condoms, personal lubricant, and all-natural feminine cleansing wipes for women. It’s the startup’s first product line outside of feminine care. “Until now, there wasn’t really a place for women to turn to for honesty, reliability and information when it comes to their sex products,” says Kier of the new product lineup. “Historically, sexual wellness companies have been primarily marketed towards men and promote products that contain obscure ingredients and unnatural additives.” SEX by LOLA products, on the other hand, don’t have “irritating” additives, the founder explains, but still deliver the sensation and reliability you’d expect, she says. These new products are also offered on subscription, starting at $10 per month for a 12-count box of condoms or 12-count box of cleansing wipes. The company plans to use the Series B funds to finance product development, expand customer outreach – including through events, partnerships and offline – and expand its 19-person, currently New York-based team. More importantly, perhaps, is throwing more fuel on the fire, as LOLA is no longer without competition. There are a number of subscription startups for feminine products on the market today, including Le Parcel (which also ships chocolate); organic rival Cora, which focuses on discrete, portable tampons and carrying cases; Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company (which just got $200M ) and sustainable competitors like Flex’s tampon alternative, as well as other reusable menstrual cups, like Diva Cup. And, of course, you can subscribe and save on Amazon to almost anything, including tampons. LOLA declines to share details related to the size and growth of its customer base or its revenue, so it’s difficult to rank LOLA in terms of its competition. Where LOLA may have some leverage, however, is encouraging more open discussions about female reproductive health, and engaging its customers through social media. The startup touts 6 times the number of Instagram followers compared with mainstream brands, for example, and says 1 in 4 customers have directly engaged with its brand over a variety of communication channels, including calls, emails, DMs, texts, and letters. ACG’s investment could help LOLA become more of a household name. The firm has previously backed brands like Harry’s, Pacifica, Shake Shack, Plum Organics, PDQ, barkTHINS, EVOL Foods, Suja Juice, Nudestix, and others. “LOLA is at the epicenter of the shift towards transparency in the women’s health category, and we couldn’t be more impressed with the brand Alex and Jordana have built and the impactful conversation they’ve driven,” said Alliance Consumer Growth Managing Partner, Trevor Nelson, in a statement about its funding. “We’re thrilled to welcome LOLA into the ACG family and support their continued evolution and product innovation, enabling them to meet their consumers’ needs,” he added.","LOLA, a subscription service delivering tampons and pads, and now other products, including condoms, lubricant, and feminine cleansing wipes, has closed on $24 million in Series B funding.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Floridas Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen. While Florence drenched the Carolinas with record rainfall and other hurricanes attack with wind, Michaels main threat will be surge. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Michael could send up to 13 feet of storm surge roaring ashore. Thats a lot of water, and there are a handful of interwoven factors explaining why the surge could be so high. First, theres the storm itself. Michael is a pretty big. Hurricane-force winds extend 35 miles out from the now Category 3 storms core, but tropical storm-force winds extend a whopping 185 miles outward. As the storm rotates, its long, windy arms scoop up water and push it along. The underwater and shoreline topography of the Gulf Coast will lend a hand. The area Michael is headed has a shallow continental shelf that extends up to 90 miles offshore. That water is a lot easier to stir up than the deep ocean. Apalachee Bay very efficiently generates storm surge because of its concave shape and shallow bathymetry, or water depth, Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Apalachee Bay sits smack between Cedar Key and Indian Pass, right at the epicenter of the highest surge forecasts. Needham also warned of a terrifying-sounding shelf wave as Michael pushes north. Because the storms movement mirrors the Florida coastline, it basically traps a wave that travels along the coast in the same direction as the storm according to Needham. This happened during Hurricane Dennis, the last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle in 2005, and contributed to higher surge. The pile on doesnt stop there, though. Michaels arrival coincides with the king tides, an annual tradition of the highest tides of the year in Florida which occur when the moon is full or new and the Earth is closest to the Sun. The storm is expected to make landfall sometime in the late morning or early afternoon. Thankfully the high tide isnt until around 10 p.m., but Michael will still strike when the tide is rising. And complete the whole shit show scenario, theres sea level rise. Carbon pollution has contributed to melting land ice and warming and expanding the ocean. Floridas Gulf Coast has seen sea level rise 8-9 inches over the past century. Sea level rise has ushered in a sunny day flooding crisis across the U.S., and its giving storms like Michael a boost they dont really need. Update 5:07 p.m. ET: This post has been updated to reflect the 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, which upgraded Michael to Category 3 storm with 13 feet of surge potential.","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Florida’s Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.
In 1906, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck San Francisco, destroying much of the city and killing as many as 3,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. But it also gave birth to modern American earthquake science. Now, researchers are trying to understand the quake using cutting-edge techniquesand some old documents.
Its important to understand how these larger quakes occurred so we can build safer buildings, explained Swetha Veeraraghavan, postdoctoral research associate in structural computational science at Idaho National Laboratory. I think these types of eyewitness accounts really help with this. Thats why I found the problem really cool.
Scientists have tried analyzing old images and eyewitness data before in order to better understand the 1906 quake. Newer earthquake simulations based on more data and better computational power inspired the researchers to take another look at this famous image of a steam locomotive sitting on its side, taken shortly after the quake. They also examined a conductors description of the incident. The 1907 account reads:
At Point Reyes Station at the head of Tomales Bay the 5:15 train for San Francisco was just ready. The conductor had just swung himself on when the train gave a great lurch to the east, followed by another to the west, which threw the whole train on its side. The astonished conductor dropped off as it went over, and at the sight of the falling chimneys and breaking windows of the station, he understood that it was the Temblor. The fireman turned to jump from the engine to the west when the return shock came. He then leaped to the east and borrowing a Kodak he took a picture of the train here presented.
This might sound like meager information with which to reconstruct an earthquake, but it provides more data than you might think. The quake must have been powerful enough to cause the rocking and the tipping of the train. The team simplified the trains measurements into a long rectangular prism, and simplified the quake to an up-and-down wave motion of the ground. They then used equations devised to describe a rocking rectangular block in response to ground motion to calculate how big the wave must have been in order to tip the train.
Their analysis revealed that the minimum acceleration of the ground required to overturn the train would have been 4 meters per second squared (a little less than half the acceleration of something falling to the Earth in a vacuum), while the minimum velocity would have been 0.5 meters per second, or around 1.6 feet per second.
On top of their analysis of the train tipping, the researchers were able to estimate the location of the earthquakes hypocenterthe area where it actually occurred in the Earth below the epicenter on the surfacebased on the trains location and behavior. While previous models have suggested three locations for a hypocenter, this result reveals that only a hypocenter to the south of Point Reyes, California, would recreate the eastward, then westward tipping of the train, according to the paper published in Seismological Research Letters. This leaves a hypocenter offshore from San Francisco or near the California city of San Juan Bautista, confirming previous estimates.
The paper comes with uncertaintiesfor example, the researchers didnt know how much the train weighed, and are using a simplified model to understand what went on. 
Still, it confirms a body of research recreating this important quake. And it shows more generally that even in the absence of data, context clues, eyewitness accounts, and photographs can prove important for understanding earthquakes. Veeraraghavan said: People have even used tombstones or statues that toppled over to estimate the ground motion.",Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.

Ed Cara,"The latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease to hit the Democratic Republic of Congo is only getting worse. But the U.S. government has pulled its experts from the affected areas of the African country in recent weeks, citing safety concerns. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported its newest figures on the current outbreak, located in the North Kivu province along the eastern region of the DRC. Its the 10th known Ebola outbreak to hit the country and the second recorded this year. Since August 1, there have been at least 211 confirmed and probable cases of the often fatal viral disease, with 135 deaths. Officials had been optimistic that the outbreak was on the decline, after a fewer cases were reported in September. But the first half of October has seen a rapid influx of new infections, now confirmed to be a second wave. The WHO expects the outbreak will last at least three or four more months. Despite the worsening state of the epidemic, however, health officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being kept away from the front lines, STAT reported Sunday. The State Departments command to relocate came down after an attack on UN peacekeepers in late August, according to STAT. This outbreak is occurring in a highly insecure environment, which complicates public health response activities, an unnamed State Department official told STAT. The region is frequently beset by armed conflict between rebel fighters and the DRC government. And the violence has certainly hurt efforts to track and contain the outbreak. Last month, the WHO temporarily suspended activity in the area for the same reason. But public health experts are worried that the unilateral withdrawal by the CDC will only worsen things. CDC has responded to nearly two dozen filovirus outbreaks in its history and has people whove been working on these issues for 30 years. It doesnt make sense to have those people hundreds or thousands of miles away from where the disease is actually spreading, Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, told STAT. Ebola is transmitted by close contact with bodily fluids, such as blood and semen. And historically, its spread has been aided by community practices such as kissing the bodies of the deceased. But efforts to prevent transmission and isolate victims by Ebola response workers are frequently met with distrust by local residents, and occasionally violence. The new wave of cases has originated from the town of Beni, more than 40 miles away from the original epicenter of Mangina and bordering the country of Uganda. And in part because of the violence enveloping the country, the WHO has warned that the risk of the outbreak spreading beyond the DRC to Uganda and another nearby country, Rwanda, is very high. While public health workers continue to face an uphill battle against the virus, there are some positives. Unlike in 2014, when the largest outbreak of Ebola in history claimed over 11,000 lives, there is now an effective, if still experimental, vaccine available. The vaccine is being given to close family members and contacts of identified victims, as well as health care workers, a strategy known as ring vaccination. Uganda is also prepared to begin using the vaccine should the outbreak cross its borders. At least five experimental treatment drugs are also being used in the current outbreak, according to the Doctors Without Borders. These treatments are aimed at reducing the diseases mortality rate, which is typically 50 percent, the WHO reports.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The time of great suffering is upon us. The polar vortex is ushering in a deep freeze across the Midwest thats among the coldest cold air outbreak in recent memory. 
Temperatures have started to plunge in the Midwest and they wont stop dropping until they reach record-low territory on Wednesday. Were talking reaching the point where Celsius and Fahrenheit cross paths (thats minus-40 degrees), especially when factoring in the wind chill. Were talking Minneapolis, Chicago, and other parts of the Midwest being as cold or colder than Antarctica. And unfortunately were also talking about adding another absurd, typo-laden tweet to the oeuvre of Trump climate thoughts while everyone else tweets helpful reminders the rest of the planet is still very hot (also, theres also a burgeoning line of research Arctic warming could be contributing to cold air outbreaks like this).
The icy tendrils of the polar vortexa blob of frigid air that usually stays locked in the Arctic thanks to the jet streamhave been creeping down from the Arctic and across Canada over the past few days, and now theyve crossed the border into the U.S. Chicago is expected to top out at 4 degrees Fahrenheit while Minneapolis reached minus-7 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday before the mercury begins a free fall this evening. Wind chills have already reached minus-61 degrees in Grand Forks, North Dakota. 
So yeah, its already really, really cold out.
Yet what comes next could be, in the all-caps words of the National Weather Service, HISTORIC COLD. Lows are expected to bottom out at minus-28 Fahrenheit in Minneapolis, just a few degrees shy of the all-time cold record. In northern Ohio, the agency is forecasting that Wednesday may be the first time since January 1994 that highs remain below zero in many locations. The power and breadth of the big freeze is stunning.
This is a very intense but concentrated area of extremely cold air that will nonetheless put about 100 million people in the single digits or well below zero, Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at weather.us, told Earther in an email.
Add in powerful winds out of the north and the situation will go from risky cold to deadly cold. Wind chill warnings gird the country from North Dakota to Pennsylvania with the epicenter of chill in Minnesota. There, the National Weather Service is warning that [d]angerous wind chills of 45 below to 65 below zero are expected for most of the period from Tuesday night through Thursday morning.
All this explains why colleges and grade schools alike have canceled classes, Illinois governor has already issued a disaster proclamation, and Chicago is moving to position warming buses throughout the city for the homeless to access if they cant reach a shelter. The precautions are vitally important as wind chill can set in within 5 minutes under the conditions being forecast, and if you live in an area with a wind chill warning, heed it.
If theres one silver lining to the cold blast, its that it will be short-lived and followed by oddly warm weather to end the week. The polar vortex-induced cold will retreat into Canada where it belongs, along with maple syrup and moose. 
Temperatures could climb above 40 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend in Minneapolis and Chicago. As Maue put it, after the warm-up, it will all average out. If youre one of the 100 million people freezing your ass off on Wednesday, feel free to keep repeating that like its some kind of moral victory.",The time of great suffering is upon us.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Green New Deal had its big debut in Washington, D.C. last month, and now advocates are set to tour the country touting its bonafides this spring. 
On Tuesday, the Sunrise Movement announced its plan to hold 100 town halls around the U.S. starting in April. The events will feature local speakers and politicians talking about how the Green New Deal can address climate change, inequality, and transition the economy to a no-carbon future.
The town halls are a chance to inform the public about whats in the Green New Deal, a mix of policy proposals with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Polling shows that the public is largely supportive of the core ideas espoused by the Green New Deal but also isnt clear on what exactly is in it, or what it would mean locally. 
A big part of this is about showcasing how the Green New Deal will benefit communities across the country, Stephen OHanlon, the communications director for the Sunrise Movement, told Earther. 
The group, which has been a galvanizing force behind the Green New Deal since late last year, announced nine flagship stops around the U.S. and put out a call to action for supporters to organize their own town halls. The planned stops range from coast-to-coast and include cities like Boston, New Orleans, Des Moines, and Detroit as well as smaller locales like Richmond, Kentucky in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells home state and Paradise, California, the epicenter of last years horrific Camp Fire. The tour stops reflect the multiple aims of the Sunrise Movement as it looks to build on momentum around the Green New Deal.
Stopping in Iowa, for example, reflects the states importance as an early battleground in the 2020 presidential primary. Major Democratic candidates have already staked out their claims as climate champions and the town hall there will ensure the Green New Deal stays on voters minds (or gets on their radar). Other cities like New Orleans and Paradise highlight places already struggling with the impacts of climate change that the Green New Deal could help. 
Meanwhile, Richmond and Detroit are places where communities are being left behind (or could be) by the transition away from coal and gas guzzling cars.Though the plan calls for the transition to be a just one, a number of labor unions representing industries that the transition to a clean economy could upend recently came out against the Green New Deal. Pitching what a just transition looks like and winning support in locations like Detroit will be crucial for the deals continued momentum. 
The tagline were using here is making Detroit the engine of the Green New Deal, Nicholas Jansen, the Sunrise Movements Michigan state director, told Earther. Theres so much potential there to put people back to work [and] lift the people who have been left behind and hurt by climate change.
To realize that potential, Jansen said activists will have to overcome suspicion after decades of broken promises to revitalize Detroit and bring together everyone from frontline communities to trade unions. Its not a small lift, but itll have to happen if the deal is to have political life beyond aspirations. And bringing those communities and others around the country together to talk about it is one way to potentially get there.","The Green New Deal had its big debut in Washington, D.C. last month, and now advocates are set to tour the country touting its bonafides this spring.

Associated Press,"(LIMA) — A powerful earthquake struck off Peru’s coast early Sunday, destroying adobe structures and killing at least one person, according to officials. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the 4:18 a.m. temblor had a magnitude of 7.1, down from an earlier calculation of 7.3. The epicenter was 25 miles (40 kilometers) south-southwest of the small town of Acari in the Arequipa district. It was centered 22 miles (36 kilometers) below the surface. Arequipa Gov. Yamila Orosio tweeted that at least one person was killed and that there were reports of power outages and collapsed adobe structures. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that “hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts” and that larger-than-normal waves could hit Peru and Chile.

David Geer,"In the space of a generation, video games have shifted from being a niche pursuit on the edge of entertainment to a billion today industry, that is today the epicenter of pop culture today. In 2017 alone the global gaming industry was projected to generate a profit of $116 billion dollars! Even more remarkable, its size is growing – and growing fast, over 10% in just one year! This trend has been developing for a long time now. Over the course of many years, blockbuster titles like Grand Theft Auto 4, The Last of Us, sports series like the FIFA and NBA2K series, and most recently massive online multiplayer games like PUBG and League of Legends have seen games shift from something played at home, to something visible across every aspect of our society. Why Games Enjoy Success Today celebrities play games, their designers are world famous, and there are huge industries dedicated to making the world of video games more enjoyable for all who live in it. At its core, video games offer a wonderful and safe form of escapism. Anybody can pick up a controller or play a game on their smartphone, and escape the world and all its troubles for a while. Overtime, games have grown more immersive, more engaging, and offered long playthroughs. Once upon a time, a old 2D game could perhaps have been beaten in 6 hours. Today, many games require at least 60 hours – and some even more than 600! – to truly complete the journey. And even then, that’s only single player mode. This reality combined with a ton of fun offered in multiplayer, has helped turned video games into the giant of industry it is today. The Mobile Movement While consoles and powerful desktop computers have showcased the most stunning games, smartphone and tablet gaming has also become huge. In fact, more people today use mobile devices to access the online world than they do desktop computers. In 2016 over 4 billion people used the internet via a mobile device, up a massive 7% on just one year ago. This revolution has had a huge impact on the gaming world also. Today, the mobile gaming industry attracts the business of some of the world’s most famous gaming studios. From Rockstar to Square Enix, Capcom, Activision, and beyond! Even more impressive, former console-only studios like Nintendo and Sega now offer games via mobile apps. In complement to this, many console and desktop-only games – while not offered fully on mobile – have compendium apps that allow people to still engage and enjoy a game’s universe while on the move. This growth in mobile gaming has been a truly wonderful develop for all who aspire to see accessible and enjoyable games available, anywhere and anytime. The Road Ahead While this phenomenon is wonderful, its true too new challenges have emerged in this field that remain important. In particular, the rise of ‘sameness’ in many video games has won the irritation of longtime fans. In a world with such immense power and sophisticated technology on offer, longtime gamers have been frustrated by some studios continuing to release the same sort of titles again and again. Whether it is a first-person shooter, a sports game, or any other type of title. At its core, gamers want to see titles that are new, diverse and innovative‚ and crucially; deliver value for money. They especially want to see titles they build on the old principles of gaming. Games that excite, delight, and offer something nobody has ever seen before. The world of gaming shifted from niche hobby to billion dollar industry thanks to developers and studios who believed a new creativity in games could begin a revolution! It is within the spirit that many gamers desire to see change today. But the good news is the future looks promising. The greater accessibility of the internet to people around the world has allowed countless gamers to learn how to to code and create their own games. So too has the rise of social media provided the opportunity for gamers to critique titles they don’t like. And best of all, the accessibility of video channels like YouTube has meant gamers no longer need to buy a game without having seen what it is like. Instead they can watch, see it play in real time, and ‘vote with their feet’ if they don’t like the way it looks. All of this creates a world where games will have a greater quality, the industry a greater democracy, and gives rise to the promise that the next generation of gaming will be the very best ever! That is surely our hope, one gamer to another.","In the space of a generation, video games have shifted from being a niche pursuit on the edge of entertainment to a billion today industry, that is today the epicenter of pop culture today.

Kyle Peterson,"Deltona, Fla. Ron DeSantis seems to relish the moment that he bestows his opponent with a new Trumpian nicknameor three. Mr. DeSantis, a Republican former congressman for the Daytona Beach area, wants to be Floridas next governor. But the polls show him steadily trailing Andrew Gillum, the unashamedly progressive Tallahassee mayor. So standing before 150 supporters on Monday, about 30 minutes north of Orlando, Mr. DeSantis cranks up the heat. It starts with a line about last weeks rancorous debate, the candidates first meeting. Mr. Gillum, who unfailingly calls his opponent Mr. DeSantis, was piqued at being addressed as Andrew. Hes really upset because I referred to him by his first name in the debate: Oh, show respect, dont call me Andrew, Mr. DeSantis says. If he wants a proper title, I mean, I can do Crooked Mayor Gillum. A few minutes later, Mr. DeSantis switches to Failed Mayor Gillum, and then Radical Mayor Gillum. Each label is followed by a riffon Mr. Gillums agenda, Tallahassees murder rate, the Federal Bureau of Investigations corruption probe into the capital citys government. Andrew has used political office to feather his own nest, Mr. DeSantis says matter-of-factly. Two days later, during a rally with President Trump in Fort Myers, he floats the idea that Mayor Gillum could be impeached. The audience chants: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! Is this shtick, familiar from 2016, salable two years later? After Mr. Trumps big victory, pundits debated whether he had realigned the electorate. That question is now being put to the test, as candidates who embraced Mr. Trump to win GOP primaries are struggling to win general elections, even against left-wing Democrats in swing states. Mr. Trump might have consolidated Republican support, but gubernatorial races in Florida, Michigan and Minnesotaand even Kansas and Georgiawill show if Trumpism appeals to a majority or creates an opening for Democrats to seize the center. Florida hasnt had a Democratic governor since 1999, and many voters are cheering Mr. Gillums pledge to turn the state blue. During a Gulf Coast bus tour Tuesday from Port Richey to Fort Myers, Mr. Gillum tells an audience that he wants to win back this state for everyday working people. That means raising the minimum wage to $15 and the corporate income tax from 5.5% to 7.75%. He would pour $1 billion into public schools, pledging to pay teachers what they are worth by lifting starting salaries to $50,000. And hes suggested winding down Floridas broad school-choice programs. The mayor backs Medicare for All and says Florida should expand Medicaid to cover another 800,000 of the most medically needy people in our state. He supports a ban on so-called assault weapons. If you need a gun that can fire 60 bullets, as a hunter, he deadpans, you need to retire your hunters license. Its not for you. Man, you ought to do something else. Mr. Gillum brags that the week Mr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate deal, Tallahassee broke ground on a 120-acre solar project. Why dont we make it mean something to live in the Sunshine State? he says. He wants Washington to abolish ICEImmigration and Customs Enforcementand replace it with a more compassionate agency. He has talked about issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens. Its hardly the moderate message Florida Democrats usually pitch. Mr. DeSantis says he is on a mission to protect Floridas future from this liberal litany. He tells me backstage that the mayors polices would destroy Floridas economy: It would cost jobs. It would cause businesses to leave the state. Instead he says Florida has a historic opportunity to drive record investment. New limits on the federal deduction for state and local taxes make Floridas low rates all the more attractive. Jeb Bush, governor from 1999-2007, has similar worries about the Gillum agenda. I dont think he understands how the economyour success, what its about. Were not a California or a New York, Mr. Bush says. Were a limited-government state, and weve invested in the long-term things, and its worked out pretty good. And anything that would occur to stifle that economic activity would hurt a whole lot of working Floridians. Mr. DeSantis wants to expand school choice. The Florida Supreme Court struck down a voucher program in 2006, but the state developed a workaround: Businesses get a tax credit for donating to a scholarship fund, which today is helping 100,000 low-income students attend private schools. In theory, Mr. DeSantis supports uncapping this program, but he says in terms of the corporate deductions, we may be at the limits of what that could do. So wed have to figure out how you would be able to redirect money. Which brings him to the state high court. Three justices, all first appointed in the 1990s by Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles, face mandatory retirement next year. Mr. DeSantis promises to pick judges like Justice Clarence Thomas to replace them. When we do that successfully with those three selections, we will have ended judicial activism in Florida for a generation. That could eventually reopen the case, he suggests, for vouchers or similar state funding mechanisms for school choice. Mr. DeSantis wants to mandate that employers use E-Verify to check workers immigration status, and he vows that Florida will never be a sanctuary state. Political junkies may remember a campaign ad from this summer in which he urges his toddler daughter, playing with blocks, to build the wall! Lately Mr. DeSantiss biggest applause line has been to invoke the FBIs probe, opened in 2015, into Tallahassees redevelopment agency. Mr. Gillum says the feds have told him he isnt a target. Still, documents released last week appear to show that during a 2016 trip to New York, Mr. Gillum took a ticket to the Broadway show Hamilton from an undercover agent posing as a property developer. The same agent, emails suggest, may have paid the $4,400 food tab after a Gillum fundraiser. The mayor has denied any impropriety, but an investigation by the state ethics commission is under way. Mr. DeSantis says the Hamilton ticket is clearly an illegal gift. So lock him up? Look, I think he needs to be held accountable, Mr. DeSantis replies. I mean, what sentence that would be, I dont know. But at the end of the day, I think Florida law is pretty clear about what youre allowed to accept as an elected official. Ebullient crowds have turned out for Mr. Gillums bus tour nevertheless. They spill out of gymnasiums and Baptist sanctuaries, craning their necks for a peek at their champion. The mayor, who spent his childhood near Miami, tells them he was the fifth of seven kids and the first to finish high school. My mother was a school-bus driver, and my father was a construction worker, he says. When my dad didnt have construction work to do, you would find him on a street corner selling fruits or vegetables. On Saturday morning, he would set up his car across the street from the cemetery and sell flowers to bereaved families. Between my mom and dad, they were the best examples of hard work that I know unto this day. Mr. Gillum appears at rallies in as many as eight towns a day. He takes pride in stumping in red counties, and he recounts how, at a St. Augustine park last Sunday, he campaigned practically in the shadow of a 25-foot obelisk dedicated to the Confederate dead. Weve gotta stop treating the race for governor as if its the Electoral College. You dont win one county and lose one county, he says. The way you win is by getting: One. More. Vote. He tries to capitalize on his opponentsand the presidentsbrash rhetoric. Mr. DeSantis, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law, wasnt always a sharp-tongued Trumpite. His 2011 book, Dreams From Our Founding Fathers, is a tea-party jeremiad sprinkled with quotes from the Federalist Papers. His 2016 presidential endorsement was tepid: In light of the exit from the race by Ted Cruz and John Kasich, it is now clear that Donald Trump will accumulate the delegates necessary to be nominated by the Republican Party, he said. If we want to defeat Hillary Clinton and have a chance to change the trajectory of our country, we need to unite behind the Republican ticket. But Mr. DeSantis has since become an outspoken Trump defender on cable TV. This grabbed the presidents attention and earned Mr. DeSantis an endorsement tweet in June that helped him to a GOP primary victory over Adam Putnam, the popular but conventional Florida secretary of agriculture. Yet the cable TV hits have also gotten Mr. DeSantis into trouble. The day after the primary, he created a furor when he said that electing Mr. Gillum would undermine Floridas success: The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda. Mr. Gillum, who is black, denounced the comment as coded language, which the DeSantis camp called absurd. Mr. Gillum added this week that his opponent has given too much harbor to racists and xenophobes and anti-Semites. In one debate, Mr. Gillum denied that he was calling Mr. DeSantis a racist: Im simply saying the racists believe hes a racist. This week Mr. Trump clacked out a message on Twitter calling Mr. Gillum a thief. In a TV interview the same night, the president upgraded that assessment to a stone-cold thief. Asked to comment the following morning, in between rallies, Mr. Gillum is cool as a cucumber. The president should grow up, he says. Were adults, and I think that this moment requires adult conversations. Thief? If were stealing anything, its hearts and mindsand were going to win this election because of that.

Alexandra Ulmer,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela’s eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. But the quake’s depth - 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface - appeared to have mitigated the damage. Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] told Reuters the OPEC member’s refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuela is not in a good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis with medicine running short, hospitals barely able to function and some severe shortages of basics such as chicken and milk. The tremor - one of the country’s strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m. (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela’s picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and frightened people into dashing into the streets. “I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,” said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the coastal epicenter. “We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end.” Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. “There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,” said Rodriguez. Damage in Caracas was limited, but the quake did tilt the top five floors of an abandoned 45-story skyscraper known as the ‘Tower of David’, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. The tower, originally intended to be a bank center but abandoned since 1994 and later occupied by squatters for years, dominates Caracas’ skyline. It features in the U.S. television spy drama “Homeland”. Pictures after the quake showed the building’s top floors, which are unfinished, leaning sideways. Out east, the governor of Sucre called for calm. “Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,” said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro’s Socialist Party. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information. ANDES, CARIBBEAN HIT The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. Traffic jams formed on highways in Port of Spain, but there were no immediate reports of casualties there either. Colombia’s government said the country was unharmed too, although workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in the mountainous capital Bogota. “It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,” said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana. United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake’s depth would have dampened some of the shaking. “A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The Earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,” she said by telephone.

Peter Morici,"China is building a world-class navy to challenge the U.S.
Resolving differences on trade, investment and industrial policies by March 1, as Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have resolved, is a terribly ambitious goal considering the complexity of the issues. 
More importantly, however, Chinas bilateral trade surplus is at the epicenter of its efforts to achieve parity or surpass the United States as the pre-eminent global superpower.
This contest is waged in four theaters the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea and broader Pacific and Indian Oceans, the race for dominance in artificial intelligence, and most importantly, the standoff over trade.
Past U.S. presidents appeased Beijing by letting it enable, effectively unchallenged, North Koreas nuclear weapons and missile programs. Those now pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland, and Trump has responded by coordinating tough international sanctions.
Unfortunately, China and Russia have enabled North Korea to circumvent critical elements of those sanctions. That permits North Korean President Kim Jong-un to slow walk the denuclearization that was anticipated by the U.S.-North Korean framework agreement. 
Festering American preoccupation with the Korean Peninsula distracts attention from the South China Sea, where Beijings forces have taken possession, expanded and militarized islands in international waters, and violated the freedom of navigation and the sovereignty of neighboring states.
China is building a navy to challenge American sea power. That shakes confidence among our Southeast Asian friends, and it has established a naval base on the Horn of Africa and has taken possession of a vital port in Sri Lanka.
With the Belt and Road Initiative, China is financing a network of ports and rail connections stretching from China to Europe and duping developing nations, like Sri Lanka, into debt servitude. Importantly, it seeks an undisputed sphere of influence through island nations stretching from Taiwan to Sri Lanka and the Maldives and on to the Horn of Africa.
All of this takes hundreds of billions of dollars to buy, develop and as necessary illegally appropriate Western technology and hardware ranging from port cranes to fighter aircraft to artificial intelligence enabled hardware and software. Its substantially financed by Chinas elaborate trade and industrial policies designed to foster trade surpluses with the United States.
China closes its markets to competitive U.S. products with high tariffs and administrative barriers. American companies seeking to produce directly in China must hand over technology through joint ventures and by establishing product development labs that employ Chinese engineers.
Firms like Apple AAPL, -2.59%
 and Google 
GOOG, -0.34%
 , if wishes to return to the Middle Kingdom, must recognize Taiwan as a province of China, turn a blind eye to Beijings egregious human-rights violations, help enforce Chinas Great Fire Wall, and enable technologies, as needed, to build out Beijings population-monitoring and social-credit system. 
Now Google is balking at assisting the Pentagon with similar facial-recognition technologies.
China is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into accomplishing dominance in artificial intelligence and supporting computer hardware a technological ecosystem that will be the analog in this century to what water power and mechanized mills were in the 19th century and electrification and computerization were in the early 20th century.
Mastery of those technologies established British and then American industrial dominance and provided the wealth for strong armies and navies. Now Beijing is outspending America, outthinking the bureaucracy in Washington, and exploiting American apathy.
Recent polls show Americans dont see China as a threat. Yet, trade is the linchpin of Chinas strategy. Without the $360 billion bilateral trade surplus, China simply would not have the cash to finance all these adventures.
Beijing cant print yuan 
USDCNY, -0.0014%
 by borrowing such sums because even its own citizens dont want to hold yuan-denominated assets. Once they have made their money they want to invest in the West, making capital controls essential to the stability of Chinas fragile financial system and the international value of its currency.
Even with the best of intentions, conforming Chinas centrally directed capitalism to Western norms of free-market behavior, as was incorrectly presumed would evolve when it was admitted to the World Trade Organization, would require dramatic cultural changes among its state-owned enterprises and within the Communist Party. 
However difficult, those are made practically impossible by the central role that trade surpluses play in financing Chinas broader geopolitical ambitions.

Billy Steele,"Charlotte is a NASCAR city. While the official headquarters may be in Daytona Beach, Florida, and the governing body of stock car racing has offices in other cities, Charlotte is the epicenter of all things NASCAR. The Hall of Fame and a major portion of NASCAR's offices are downtown, and a lot of the race teams are headquartered nearby. Plus, Charlotte Motor Speedway is just a few minutes north, in Concord. So it makes sense, then, that Fox Sports would coordinate its NASCAR coverage from a facility just north of downtown -- the same spot where the broadcaster made its final preparations for the World Cup earlier this year. Inside the former home of the Speed Network, Fox Sports broadcasts its NASCAR Race Hub show every weekday. Think of it as a news hour for NASCAR. During the hour-long broadcast, hosts, commentators and experts analyze the previous weekend's action and preview upcoming races. The Race Hub studio needed a refresh this year, though, and Fox Sports Senior Vice President Zack Fields explained the network had some specific goals for the overhaul. Realism and versatility were at the top of the list. Unreal Engine allows production teams to expand their bag of tricks exponentially. ""In the past, virtual sets were used as a cost-saving venture, but with new technology -- specifically what we're doing with Unreal Engine -- the level of realism that you can achieve opens the doors to so much more,"" Fields said. ""You're not limited to a space, and you're not limited to graphics to convey storylines during your shows."" He noted that most of the work was behind the scenes, creating a custom application that can link what they need for television production to a video game engine. Fox Sports plans to start putting the new space through its paces in the lead up to the 2019 Daytona 500. That race is scheduled for mid February and is basically the Super Bowl of NASCAR -- even though it's the first race of the season. That's quite the debut for your production team's new crown jewel. The most impressive thing about this virtual space is that it looks like a normal studio. Having seen the current Race Hub set, if you told me this was just a redesign of that physical space, I would probably believe you. But it's the details that really make this a showpiece. In a demo reel that previews the studio, the virtual set itself looks massive -- much larger than it is in real life. The space allows Fox Sports to ""park"" 10 stock cars on set, which is probably about eight more than the actual studio will accommodate. When it's time to preview a specific event or venue, Fox Sports can easily put a section of the track -- Daytona International Speedway, for example -- with a race car rolling on it behind the host. A balcony around the the top of the virtual set gives producers even more perspectives to shoot from. The result is a regular-sized studio that's tucked into the corner of a building but appears to offer the space of an airplane hangar. In the future, if Fox Sports needs to move on to another show for the next hour, the whole thing can be swapped out in minutes, and without any literal heavy lifting. The virtual set itself looks massive -- much larger than it is in real life. So if a broadcaster is going to invest in its ""most advanced studio,"" why put it in Charlotte instead of its Los Angeles headquarters? A few reasons. First, NASCAR is a huge part of the network's coverage. There's racing content broadcast every single day. The second is available space. Fox Sports had the room in North Carolina to build out this 60-foot-by-60-foot production space. And last, the Race Hub set was due for an overhaul. ""It was the perfect spot for us to experiment,"" Fields said. He explained that the sport itself is very tech-heavy, which opens up all kinds of possibilities for production visuals. More specifically, where a 3D model of a dissected stock car may have been on a display before, now it will be just like a full-size car is on set with the hosts. Multiple cars can rise up through the floor and be not only on the set but also moved around easily -- a feat that's not easily achieved with actual, very heavy stock cars. Fox Sports can also bring a remote location to the set instead of having to send a team there. In the demo reel, there are examples of things like track elevations and examining specific sections of a track in lifelike, and life-size, detail. One minute analysts are explaining key parts of a 3D model, and the next they're standing on a track. ""It creates this seamless transition from the virtual set into the 3D world,"" Fields described.","It's no secret that Epic Games has enabled a number of gaming studios to create more-realistic visuals with its Unreal game engine.

Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports of damage except to a chimney on one of the Channel Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. in the Channel Islands region, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southwest of the mainland city of Ventura. Some bricks fell from a chimney at an 1860s ranch on Santa Cruz Island, but no one was hurt, said Yvonne Menard, spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it went into ""earthquake mode"" and firefighters from all 106 of its firehouses began surveys of their territories, including bridges, dams, large buildings and power lines. ""We currently have no reports of damage or injuries,"" spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the earthquake warning system under development for the West Coast gave about 10 seconds of warning before shaking arrived. Earthquakes of such size usually occur about once a year in Southern California, although the most recent one was in 2014, according to veteran seismologist Lucy Jones, recently retired from the USGS. The 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Santa Cruz Island is the largest in the chain of eight Channel Islands, five of which are in the national park. Most of Santa Cruz Island, including the historic ranch, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, which cooperatively manages the island with the Park Service.","CBS News Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California ABC15 Arizona LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports …",2018-04-06T03:09:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}",Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California - ABC15 Arizona,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/los-angeles-earthquake-magnitude-53-quake-strikes-off-california,https://mediaassets.abc15.com//photo/2011/09/19/earthquake_20110919135506_900_675.JPG,,Abc15.com,epicenter,1

Cara Anna / AP,"(JOHANNESBURG) — Health teams responding to Congo’s latest Ebola outbreak are attacked three or four times a week on average, a level of violence unseen in the country’s nine previous outbreaks of the deadly virus, the health ministry said Monday. The coordinator of the outbreak response, Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, spoke to reporters after a weekend marked by deadly rebel attacks and violent protests that suspended Ebola containment efforts in the epicenter of the outbreak. In one attack, two health agents with Congo’s military were killed by rebels in the first such deaths since the outbreak was declared Aug. 1. The next day, residents of Beni protested another rebel attack that killed 15 civilians by pelting aid groups’ vehicles with stones. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “outraged” by the violence against health workers and is calling on all armed groups to immediately stop attacks, his spokesman said Monday. The number of confirmed Ebola cases in this outbreak is now 203, including 120 deaths. The virus is spread by contact with bodily fluids of those infected, including the dead. Each suspension of Ebola containment work affects both vaccinations and the tracking of contacts of infected people. A deadly rebel attack late last month in Beni, the outbreak’s epicenter, forced work to stop for days while angry residents traumatized for years by conflict brought the community to a standstill. Since then many of the new Ebola cases have been in Beni, while aid groups have expressed alarm that the number of new cases overall more than doubled since the start of this month. In the week ending Sunday, 19 of the outbreak’s 22 new cases were in Beni. This is the first time an Ebola outbreak has occurred in Congo’s far northeast, where multiple rebel groups are active. Resistance by wary communities has been a major concern, with infected people slipping away and safe burials a flashpoint as families bristle at outsiders telling them how to say goodbye to loved ones. Bathe told reporters he regretted that some community members were putting themselves in danger. One group of youths in Beni recently stole the body of an Ebola victim on the way to the cemetery with the family’s consent, he said. After touching the corpse, one of the youths became infected and died.",Health teams responding to Congo's latest Ebola outbreak are being attacked three or four times a week on average,2018-10-23T02:23:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Health Workers Trying to Contain Congo’s Ebola Outbreak Are Being Attacked Weekly,http://time.com/5431613/health-workers-congo-attacks-ebola/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ap18294479963519.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1
Steve Guttenberg,"The two coolest audio products of the 21st century Apple/Beats No doubt about it, the Apple iPod is easily the coolest audio product of the twenty-first century. Introduced in late 2001 it wasn't the first portable digital music player, there were portable CD players like the Sony Discman in 1984, and they were definitely cool. Then Steve Jobs put his special spin on the iPod, ""To have your whole CD library with you at all times is a quantum leap when it comes to music."" It wasn't hyperbole, the iPod, Classic, Mini, Nano, Shuffle, and Touch really did change the way we listened to music. Though Creative and Diamond entered the market first, the 'Pods all looked and felt cool, and owning an iPod made you cool. Just as iPods were losing some of their luster Beats by Dre turned the related headphone market upside down in 2008. Beats may have been sold more as a fashion statement than for their sound, but in Beats wake came countless upstart headphone makers taking full advantage of the coolness Beats brought to the category. Headphones were, and remain, cool. I know it's hard to imagine now when many music lovers are more than satisfied with the sound of a single Bluetooth, Google Home Max, or Apple HomePod speaker, but there was a time in the last few decades of the twentieth century when not just audiophiles, but everyday folk's pride and joy was their home ""stereo."" In those days the coolest teenagers were the ones with a ""hi-fi"" with a turntable, CD player, amplifier, and two speakers. Original Beats Studio headphones Steve Guttenberg/CNET Audio's coolness boom exploded in the early 1950s, when a hi-fi was high tech. Owning a nice music system was a badge of honor that demonstrated you were a person who appreciated great sound. By the 1970s audio was so mainstream it was uncool not to have a great system at home or in your car. Music was at the epicenter of youth culture the way the internet is today, but that started to wane towards the end of the 1990s. Symptomatic of this trend is when Music Television, aka MTV, stopped playing music. And maybe that's why owning a ""cool"" audio system isn't happening so much anymore. Nowadays turntables are cool with a smattering of hipsters, teenagers, and die-hard audiophiles, but owning a great audio system isn't going to get admiring glances from friends and relatives. Owners of home audio systems may be small in number, but we're so cool we don't care if other people think it's cool, which is very cool.","The coolness of owning great audio gear waxes and wanes, but will music listening ever be cool again?",2018-03-10T18:47:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Remember when iPods and Beats were the coolest things around? - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/remember-when-ipods-and-beats-were-the-coolest-things-around/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/nZRV4Sb_4PeomYIt4oJxpcMiX84=/2018/03/08/338d5558-d7df-492b-9ee5-0e8f7f43de68/33192353-2-440-bt-4aaafg.jpg,,Cnet.com,epicenter,1

,"At a Glance The 7.3 quake was the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900. Buildings were evacuated Caracas, the capital city, The earthquake, felt throughout the Caribbean, happened at a considerable depth, which limited damage. A powerful earthquake shook eastern Venezuela on Tuesday afternoon, forcing residents in the captial city of Caracas to evacuate buildings to flee homes. The 7.3 quake – the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey – was felt throughout the Caribbean. But at a depth of some 76 miles (123 kilometers) it appeared to have caused only limited damage even near its epicenter a few miles off the sparsely populated Cariaco peninsula stretching into the eastern Caribbean. A similar-sized quake in the same area left dozens dead in 1997. Seismologist Lucy Jones, a research associate with the California Institute of Technology, said the earthquake’s considerable depth likely prevented a tragedy. “Shaking does die off at a distance,” she said, adding that the depth of the quake means there are likely to be fewer aftershocks. The quake was felt as far away as Colombia’s capital of Bogata. In Cumana, the biggest city near the quake’s center, supermarket shelves came crashing down. At a shopping center, a woman caught in the panic of people rushing out of the building fell on an escalator and injured herself. In Caracas, concrete fell from an unfinished office building. The quake also caused damage in Trinidad, which reported strong shaking. Power outages were reported across Trinidad, too. People ran into the street and gasped as large glass panes at one supermarket shattered and falling concrete smashed several cars. The quake also cracked walls and thousands of goods fell off supermarket shelves. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. The earthquake also was felt in Guyana, Barbados and Grenada.","The Weather Channel Strong Quake Rocks Venezuela But Causes Little Damage. Why?

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday, a hospital official told Metro TV in a report broadcast on Saturday. A tsunami up to two meters (six feet) high swept through Palu at dusk after the sleepy but growing tourist resort was rocked by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. “Bodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept by tsunami... but we are still collecting data,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman said on Saturday. Doctor Komang Adi Sujendra told Metro TV that 30 people were killed and their bodies taken to his hospital, adding another 12 injured needed orthopaedic surgery. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Nugroho declined to give an official death toll. The Palu area was hit by a lighter quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in the fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu. On Saturday, authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts without power and communications as the area was rocked by aftershocks. Metro TV played an amateur footage which showed water remaining from the tsunami, a collapsed bridge, large cracks in roads and buildings badly damaged. Tezar Kodongan, a resident of Palu who took one of the videos, told the TV station some of the city landmarks were broken. “There is no evacuation yet in the disaster area,” Kodongan added. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","July has been one for extreme heat around the world, but every locale pales in comparison to what’s going on at Death Valley in California. Already one of the hottest places on the Earth, the heat has gone into overdrive this July. Death Valley is in line to set a record for the hottest month ever recorded on Earth. Through the first 30 days of July, the average temperature there has been 108 degrees Fahrenheit. The forecast on Tuesday—the last day of the month—calls for a high of 120 degrees Fahrenheit and a low of 92 degrees Fahrenheit. If that holds, Death Valley will end July with an average temperature of 107.94 degrees Fahrenheit and a place in the history books for the hottest month reliably recorded anywhere (pending official review of course). It will take the spot of... Death Valley, which set the record last year with a July average of 107.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Hell will basically have to freeze over to keep the site from beating its previous world record. The temperature at Furnace Creek, the site of the weather station, would have to average 90 degrees Fahrenheit today. As of 10 a.m. local time, it was up to 107 degrees Fahrenheit, so I’d say that ship is rapidly sailing away. Measurements are taken once daily when a volunteer moseys out to the weather station near the Furnace Creek Visitor Center to check two thermometers that record the day’s high and low temperatures. The weather station has been functioning since 1961, though records for the area extend back to 1911 (the previous weather station was just 1,000 feet to the south). Of the five hottest months recorded at the site, four have occurred since 2005. Tourists have flocked to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America that’s also the epicenter of the extreme heat. Masochists have posed next to the visitor center’s digital thermometer and even gone for a jog, which sounds torturous. “We wanted to get to the hottest spot,” Oliver Anne, a French tourist, told the Law Vegas Review Journal. “The hotter, the better.” Well, you got it, buddy. But in all seriousness, the extremes at Death Valley are no joke. At least one visitor has died this month from the heat, according to the Review Journal, underscoring that you need to take care of yourself and heed warning signs in hot weather. July has been a month of wild heat waves that have engulfed the high Arctic, Japan, North Africa, and much of Europe. Scientists have already shown that climate change made the European heat wave more likely, and it wouldn’t be surprising in the least that the other heat waves are also linked to global warming. Rising background temperatures can amplify heat waves’ intensity and make them more common. The atmospheric setup has also helped bake in July heat in some locations, including Death Valley. The jet stream has gone wild this month, resembling a series of waves. The troughs in the waves allow cooler air from the north to dip down, but the ridges allow hot air to build up. That’s what we’ve seen in Death Valley “It’s similar throughout the desert Southwest,” Stan Czyzyk, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Las Vegas office, told Earther. “We’ve had a large ridge of high pressure over us for a good chunk of the month.” He noted that while the ridge’s intensity isn’t a record setter, it’s persistence for a whole month is what sets it apart and has helped Death Valley reach a new record. Some research has shown that climate change is making the jet stream wavier, though there’s been no specific research looking at the pattern this summer yet. As the calendar turns to August, it appears the waviness could finally break, over the Southwest at least. Czyzyk said this weekend could yield cooler temperatures that could even dip below average next week. So if you’re the masochistic type that would rather revel in the heat than beat it, you better get to Death Valley ASAP.","July has been one for extreme heat around the world, but every locale pales in comparison to what’s going on at Death Valley in California.

The quakes were well beneath the ocean and there were no initial reports of damage or injury. The NOAA reported that no tsunami was expected from the quakes. The two morning earthquakes struck two days after a magnitude 7.9 quake in the Gulf of Alaska, which resulted in a tsunami watch that was later canceled. The 5.8 earthquake struck at 8:39 a.m. about 115 miles west of Eureka, Calif., at a depth of 5 kilometers. The closest quake to shore came at 9:24 a.m. and had a magnitude of 5.0, according to the USGS. That one had a depth of 4 kilometers and was about 112 miles west of Ferndale. ""Historically this is a very active area, "" said Keith Knudsen, deputy director of the Earthquake Science Center at the USGS. He said the quakes occurred at ""the boundary between two plates that are moving relatively fast, past each other and we call this area the Mendocino Triple Junction, which implies there are three plates, and there are, but these particular quakes occurred in a boundary between two plates."" The USGS initially reported a third quake during the same hour with a 5.1 magnitude, but that turned out to be a duplicate report of the second, Knudsen said. He added that almost 150 people in the area reported light shaking. The operators of the Victorian Inn in Ferndale said nobody on staff felt the shaking, but there was some talk around town about it.

Tom McKay,"Facebook has been taking a lot of heat for myriad controversies in the US, including its jaw-dropping data privacy screwups and allegations it is maybe wrecking democracy by helping fuel online echo chambers. But as skeptical as many stateside are getting of Mark Zuckerberg and crew, the company’s role doing damage in other countries is beginning to attract more scrutiny. According to a Saturday report in the New York Times, participants on both sides of Sri Lanka’s ongoing tensions between the majority Sinhalese Buddhist population and the country’s Muslim minority have become intimately familiar with the way Facebook can be used to perpetuate conflict. While Sri Lanka’s long-running civil war between the government and Tamil separatists ended in 2009, in its wake ethnic persecution has grown to the point where the government was recently forced to declare a state of emergency. The situation is particularly bad because, as the Times detailed, for many Sri Lankans Facebook is for all purposes their primary portal to the internet, and the company has made little effort to act as a responsible gatekeeper: Time and again, communal hatreds overrun the newsfeed—the primary portal for news and information for many users—unchecked as local media are displaced by Facebook and governments find themselves with little leverage over the company. Some users, energized by hate speech and misinformation, plot real-world attacks. A reconstruction of Sri Lanka’s descent into violence, based on interviews with officials, victims and ordinary users caught up in online anger, found that Facebook’s newsfeed played a central role in nearly every step from rumor to killing. Facebook officials, they say, ignored repeated warnings of the potential for violence, resisting pressure to hire moderators or establish emergency points of contact. In the Facebook-fueled popular imagination, the Times wrote, one small town named Ampara became the “shadowy epicenter of a Muslim plot” to destroy the Sinhalese population. In one particularly notorious incident, a family of Tamil-speaking Muslims who ran a restaurant there became involved in a dispute where an angry customer believed that they had put sterilization pills in his food—almost certainly something he had seen in a viral Facebook meme. An angry mob beat the man running the register, Atham-Lebbe Farsith, and then “destroyed the shop and set fire to the local mosque.” Farsith now has to hide because he is recognizable to many from a misleading Facebook video suggesting he really did put a sterilization pill in the food. In other cases, Sinhalese extremists have posted photos of improvised weaponry to Facebook and subsidiaries like WhatsApp before deadly riots. While Facebook is sometimes compared to an absentee landlord in developing countries where it has displaced traditional media yet has little on-the-ground presence, this passage in particular makes it sound a bit more like a guy selling cigarettes to minors: But where institutions are weak or undeveloped, Facebook’s newsfeed can inadvertently amplify dangerous tendencies. Designed to maximize user time on site, it promotes whatever wins the most attention. Posts that tap into negative, primal emotions like anger or fear, studies have found, produce the highest engagement, and so proliferate. This sort of thing sounds exactly like what’s happened in Myanmar, where activists have accused Facebook of doing nothing to moderate content. As a result, the site is spreading disinformation and propaganda, building much of the furor behind the ethnic cleansing of the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Social media analyst Victoire Rio told BuzzFeed the company’s response was “grossly insufficient” and “only reinforces our belief that Facebook is not doing anywhere near as much as they should and could do to prevent the spread of hatred in Myanmar.” In Indonesia, the Times added, rumors of outsiders kidnapping children as part of organ-harvesting rings spread rapidly on Facebook, and as a result, “locals in nine villages lynched outsiders they suspected of coming for their children.” Similar rumors ended up with similar results in India and Mexico. When Sri Lankan researchers with the Center for Policy Alternatives and government officials asked for help, Facebook directed them to the reporting tool; it’s unclear how many Sinhalese-speaking moderators the site has, but 25 such positions have been unfilled since June 2017. “You report to Facebook, they do nothing,” Center for Policy Alternatives researcher Amalini De Sayrah told the Times. “There’s incitements to violence against entire communities and Facebook says it doesn’t violate community standards.” Sometimes, Facebook uses entire countries as testing grounds for changes to their platform—like in 2017, when the company rolled out changes to the news feed segregating posts from most Facebook Pages including media organizations in a separate feed in six countries including Sri Lanka. The result was plummeting engagement, and the Times writes one possible effect of that experiment was fewer people reading credible news even as attacks on Muslims in Sri Lanka were reaching a fever pitch. Even turning off Facebook doesn’t work: When the government blocked the site earlier this year as part of emergency measures, the Times wrote an estimated three million users simply turned to VPNs to gain access. While Facebook didn’t create ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, or elsewhere, it’s becoming clear that the company’s role as a gatekeeper for millions of internet users is also coming with responsibilities it is either ill-equipped to handle or simply wants to brush off. Even in the US, where it was founded, the company has been largely opaque about its rules and how it implements them, and it’s repeatedly punted when asked to do more content moderation or flag misinformation on the platform.

Rosie Perper,"Three people have died and four more have been injured following a strong earthquake off the cost of Indonesia's popular holiday destinations of Java and Bali islands on Thursday. According ot the US Geological Survey, the magnitude 6.0 quake's epicenter was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north-east of Sumberanyar on nearby Java island. The quake occured at a depth of 5.5 miles (9 kilometers), and a tsunami warning has not been issued. Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that victims were crushed by collapsed buildings while they were asleep. He added that the damage from the quake was minor. Bali is currently hosting the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. Over 19,000 delegates and guests are present, including Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. Tremors were felt on the holiday island of Bali in the capital city of Denpasar. People on the island were reported to have briefly panicked and fled their homes. The country is still reeling just two weeks after a devastating magnitude-7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi last week. Nearly 2,000 people were killed in the disaster, as rescue workers had to dig through mud, rubble, and debris for dead bodies using their bare hands. Around 5,000 people were thought to still be missing. The region has been hit by a string of several major earthquakes this year. In August, several major earthquakes on the island of Lombok, just east of Bali, caused widespread damage and killed hundreds of people. Indonesia is situated in the Ring of Fire, an area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. Earthquakes often rock the island nation, and it has some of the most active volcanoes in the area.","Three people have died and four more have been injured following a strong earthquake off the cost of Indonesia's popular holiday destinations of Java and Bali islands on Thursday.

Ed Cara,"Measles has just visited the Big Apple, and public health officials are warning the city’s small unvaccinated population to be on guard. Last Friday, the New York State Department of Health announced that an Australian tourist was confirmed to be carrying the viral disease days into their trip. Because exhaled measles can stay alive for up to two hours in the air or on surfaces, health officials have issued a precautionary alert for anyone who may have been exposed to the person as they traveled throughout the city and surrounding counties from February 16 to 21. The locations where people could have been exposed to measles are: La Quinta Inn, 31 W. 71st Street, New York, NY, between February 16 and the morning of February 19, 2018. Oasis Bible Tours at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 5th Avenue, New York, NY, the morning of February 16, and the evening of February 17, 2018. Watchtower Educational Center, 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY, between 12:30 p.m. – 6:30 p.m. on February 19, 2018. Best Western Hotel, 1324 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, from February 19 until 12:00 p.m. on February 20, 2018. Comfort Inn &amp; Suites Goshen – Middletown, 20 Hatfield Lane, Goshen, NY, from 4:30 p.m. on February 20 until 10:30 a.m. on February 21, 2018. Excel Urgent Care, 1 Hatfield Lane, Goshen, NY, between 8:00 a.m. – 11:30 a.m. on February 21, 2018. Symptoms of measles include fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, or runny nose; these typically show up 10 to 12 days after exposure. While measles is overall highly contagious, though, the risk for any one person to have contracted it from the tourist is “very low,” according to the NYSDOH. That risk is even smaller for people who have been vaccinated against it. Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, meaning that any native reservoir of the virus has been cleared out (the virus only infects humans). And according to data collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics, it’s estimated that nearly 95 percent of eligible people in New York have received the combination measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine, which is 97 percent effective against measles. The MMR shot is part of a series of required vaccinations needed for children to attend public school, but all states allow parents to obtain a religious or personal exemption. Unfortunately, the occasional case of measles continues to be imported into the states, including New York. In 2013, a outbreak spread across an orthodox Jewish community living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The original source—who caught it during a trip to London—as well as the 57 people who caught it were all unvaccinated. In 2015, an even larger outbreak spread across multiple states and involved more than 100 people, with the epicenter thought to be two Disney theme parks in California; it too spread mostly among the unvaccinated. That year also saw over 600 cases of measles in the US, the highest since it was formally booted out of the country. Things have been mostly quiet on the measles front in the US lately, but Europe has seen a worrying resurgence of cases recently. Last year, there were over 21,000 recorded cases of measles across the continent, a four-fold increase from the 5,273 cases diagnosed in 2016, which was a new low. Aside from problems with vaccine supply and health care infrastructure, it’s thought that a growing anti-vaccination sentiment has also contributed to the rise. Australia’s overall vaccination coverage rate is good, according to the country’s National Center for Immunization Research &amp; Surveillance. Most regions hover around 95 percent, which is optimal to provide herd immunity for those too young to be vaccinated or otherwise immunocompromised. But there are still pockets where coverage rates are below 75 percent. Australia also happens to be the homeland of antivax activist Stephanie Messenger, who in 2012 self-published a children’s book about the joys of a disease that once killed 2.6 million people annually: Melanie’s Marvelous Measles.","Measles has just visited the Big Apple, and public health officials are warning the city’s small unvaccinated population to be on guard.

Matthew Hughes,"Bloomberg is reporting that Microsoft has acquired GitHub, and will announce the deal on Monday. Github is an online service that allows developers to host their code in the cloud using the popular Git source management system, invented by Linux founder Linus Torvalds in 2005. In addition to being home to the overwhelming majority of open source projects, it’s also used by developers within companies to privately collaborate on software. It’s not inaccurate or hyperbole to call GitHub the epicenter of the software development universe. The site was last valued at $2 million in 2015, and it’s not yet known how much Microsoft paid for the site. It wouldn’t surprise me if it’s vastly north of that figure. Despite the company’s money woes and lack of CEO, Github holds a privileged position in the development world. Bloomberg reports that GitHub’s leadership chose to allow Microsoft to acquire it, based on the performance and leadership of Redmond CEO Satya Nadella, who has moved Microsoft beyond its “embrace, extend, extinguish” days. Under Nadella’s rule, Microsoft has enthusiastically embraced open source, with several of its projects released on Github under permissive licenses. It’s worked hard (and spent a fair bit of cash) on bringing Ubuntu and BASH to Windows, and has ported several of its popular applications to Linux and macOS, like SQL Server and Visual Studio. Rumors of the deal swirled last Friday. It’s not exactly clear how long Microsoft and GitHub have been in talks, or indeed, when the deal got inked. TNW has reached out to GitHub and Microsoft about the deal.

Michelle Mark,"President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable on immigration and the gang MS-13 in Bethpage, New York on May 23, 2018. Reuters/Kevin Lamarque President Donald Trump on Wednesday said his administration is working on a plan to withhold aid money from countries that he believes don't do enough to prevent their citizens from illegally entering the US. ""We're going to work out something where every time somebody comes in from a certain country, we're going to deduct a rather large amount of money from what we give them in aid — if we give them aid at all, which we may not give them aid at all,"" he said. Trump made the remarks during a roundtable discussion about immigration and the street gang MS-13 with law-enforcement officials in Long Island, the epicenter of MS-13 violence in the US. The president assailed US laws that allowed asylum-seekers and unaccompanied minors to stay in the US pending their immigration court dates — some of whom are MS-13 members, Trump said. At one point, Trump even accused foreign nations of encouraging their nationals to illegally enter the US. ""Many of these countries we give tremendous amounts of aid to,"" Trump said. ""You know, they'll let you think that they're trying to stop this. They're not trying to stop it — I think they encourage people from leaving. They don't want the people that we're getting in that country."" A view of the existing US-Mexico border wall. Trump wants to extend it across the entire border. Spencer Platt/Getty Images It wasn't immediately clear which countries Trump was referring to, whether he was speaking about MS-13 members specifically, or unauthorized immigrants in general. The White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn't immediately respond to a request for clarification. Trump's announcement comes amid controversy he sparked last week when he described some unauthorized immigrants as "" animals."" His supporters argued that his remarks had been taken out of context by the media, and that he was referring only to members of MS-13. ""These aren't people. These are animals, and we're taking them out of the country at a rate that's never been happened before,"" Trump said last week in California. He doubled down on the comment again at the roundtable on Wednesday, prompting cheers and applause from the audience. ""I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke,"" Trump said. ""They're not people. There are animals, and we have to be very, very tough.""","President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold aid from countries he believes don't prevent citizens from illegally entering the US.

Rusty Blazenhoff,"Daniel Contreras, the owner of El Guero Canelo restaurant in Tucson, Arizona, recently learned that his $3.50 Sonoran hot dog took one of the James Beard Foundation's five 2018 America’s Classics awards this year. The Sonora, Mexico native confessed to Tucson Weekly that he was unfamiliar with the James Beard Foundation (JBF) and its award prior to winning: ""First of all, like I told everybody else, I didn't even know who they were... I said, 'Well, I don't know who you are.' We miscommunicated because of my English, or I didn't understand exactly what they wanted from us. This is incredible what we have been honored."" The JBF writes that the ""honor is given to regional establishments, often family-owned, that are cherished for their quality food, local character, and lasting appeal"" and describe the winning dog as such: The Sonoran hot dog evinces the flow of culinary and cultural influences from the U.S. to Mexico and back. Decades ago, elaborately dressed hot dogs began to appear as novelty imports on the streets of Hermosillo, the Sonoran capital. Today, Tucson is the American epicenter, and Daniel Contreras is the leading hotdoguero. A Sonoran native, Contreras was 33 in 1993 when he opened El Guero Canelo. The original stand is now a destination restaurant, outfitted with picnic tables and serviced by a walk-up order window. Fans converge for bacon-wrapped franks, stuffed into stubby bollilos, smothered with beans, onions, mustard, jalapeño sauce, and a squiggle of mayonnaise. Contreras operates three branches in Tucson, one in Phoenix, and a bakery to supply the split-top buns.

Mark Kaufman,"When North Korea detonates nuclear bombs, it brings the devices into tunnels dug deep inside Mount Mantap, a granite peak over 7,000 feet tall. Mantap has now sustained six such detonations, with the last of which — set off on September 3, 2017 — moving the mountain more than 11 feet (3.5 meters), according to researchers who used space imaging technology, called synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, to map how much Mantap's surface shifted and then settled back down during the blast. They published their results in the journal Science on Thursday. Although this technique isn't yet used to rapidly detect attempts at secretive nuclear testing today, it could do so in the future. SEE ALSO: Extreme Arctic heat wave in 2016 wouldn't have happened without climate change ""World peace benefits from the adherence to internationally-negotiated nuclear-test-ban treaties that strive to promote the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,"" Teng Wang, lead author of the study and a tectonics senior research fellow at Earth Observatory of Singapore, said in an email. ""Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited,"" Wang added. ""This study demonstrates the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests, if any, in the future."" Wang and his team used data captured by the German imaging satellite TerraSAR-X to view the mountain before and after the explosion. The images aren't actual digital pictures of the mountain; instead, the satellite acts as a radar, bouncing pulses off the land below, which travels back up to the satellite in space, giving scientists detailed measurements — and how they changed after a powerful blast. The TerraSAR-X satellite. Image: dlr/esa The same satellite technology can be used to measure how the land deforms after earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, moving glaciers and other natural events, said Wang. A great advantage to this space imaging technique is that, unlike digital imaging, SAR can penetrate clouds and weather, to see what's transpired below. The fact that Wang could measure a massive chunk of Earth-bound rock moving horizontally over 11 feet is understandable, when considering how big the September 2017 blast was. Detonated around 1,500 feet below ground, according to researchers, it triggered a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, a strong class of temblor that causes violent shaking near the epicenter. ""This one was big enough that we saw it all over,"" Dale Anderson, a seismologist and specialist in nuclear nonproliferation monitoring at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said in an interview. ""It was picked up on the other side of the world."" (Above: A simulation of rock damage from a nuclear blast. Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Although the international community can't see what North Korea is doing under Mantap, modern detection technology — while not capable of observing the mountain move — can easily spot a large nuclear blast, and pinpoint its location. ""It’s very, very, very hard to hide one of these,"" Anderson said. As part of the international ban on testing nukes (which North Korea does not adhere to), an organization called the International Monitoring System (IMS) is measuring seismic waves ""24-7,"" said Anderson. This includes picking up movement in the rock at seismic stations around the world, as well as acoustic pulses the blast sends up into the air. Combining the two detection techniques can give scientists an accurate idea of where the shaking event came from, especially if the blast is big enough. ""Every Korean test we’ve ever heard has been big enough,"" said Anderson. And confirming that the blast is definitely nuclear, and not say, an earthquake, is also possible. Nuclear blasts release a gas called xenon, which can be picked up by detectors all over the world. Even under a mountain, the gases can seep out, said Anderson. (Above: A simulation of gas moving to the surface. Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Future nuclear blasts underneath Mantap will almost certainly be picked by the IMS, and Wang said space imaging technology can then be used to learn more detail about the event — like how deep it is, and how it affected the mountain. After enduring six nuclear blasts, one wonders how much more a mountain can take. President Donald Trump is meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on June 12, in discussions that might persuade the military commander to denuclearize the secretive, communist nation. Still, Mantap may continue to be used as a test site — if North Korea decides to continue its nuclear testing program. It takes a lot to topple a mountain. ""You're talking about a chunk of solid, confident rock that is 800 meters thick,"" said Anderson. ""You can’t just break that up with one shock."" ""You’ll eventually find a flaw and it’ll crack,"" he added. ""And if you smack it with a sledgehammer — a nuclear explosion — it might break a little quicker.""","When North Korea detonates nuclear bombs, it brings the devices into tunnels dug deep inside Mount Mantap, a granite peak over 7,000 feet tall.

Time,"One week after Papua New Guinea was rattled by a powerful earthquake, aftershocks have reportedly caused the death toll to rise to at least 67, while landslides have made the worst-hit highlands nearly unreachable. Dozens of aftershocks have added to the devastation inflicted by the initial 7.5-magnitude quake last Monday. Three particularly strong aftershocks bigger than magnitude 5 hit the Southern Highlands early Monday morning, the Guardian reports. All four regions struck by the quake remain under a state of emergency. Aid workers told the Guardian that the extent of the damage is still unknown due to the remoteness of the villages bearing the brunt of the quake. Thousands are thought to be trapped in isolated areas after landslides blocked roads to the worst-affected communities, making it all but impossible to deliver urgently needed supplies including food, water and healthcare. “Many places that have been struck are still inaccessible, except by walking in, so there is a huge supply issue in delivering aid,” Udaya Regmi, the country head of the Red Cross, told the Guardian. Regmi estimated that at least 500 people are injured and 127,000 are in need of immediate assistance. While earthquakes are a common occurrence in Papua New Guinea, which is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire where most of the world’s earthquake activity occurs, the latest tremors have been particularly catastrophic.

JIM FARBER,"Until then, they told her to dress neutrally at school, though at home she was allowed to wear “the most out-there, girly-girl outfits,” she said. In middle school, she was bullied. Then, she faced doubters in the medical community. “The first few doctors we went to told my parents, ‘Your kid’s crazy,’” Ms. Petras said. “They would ask gross, random questions, like ‘Are you attracted to your mom?’ It took us a year to find a psychologist who said, ‘It’s pretty obvious you’re a girl.’” By 14, Ms. Petras began to throw herself single-mindedly into songwriting, making demos on GarageBand, the music app. While her parents loved the cool of Miles Davis, and her older sisters were drawn to the antisocial force of heavy metal, Ms. Petras preferred the gleaming sheen and universal allure of pop. “It was a little bit of a rebellion,” she said. Her aspirations went beyond performing. More than a pop star, she pined to be part of the hit-making process as a writer and producer. While her classmates were studying trigonometry, she knocked on doors of local recording studios and created demos. Although she now says those demos “sucked,” they were enough to land her a “wack publishing deal,” she said, with Universal Germany while she was still in her teens. (The highlight was writing a jingle for a detergent brand.) All the while, she longed to be in Los Angeles, the epicenter of gloss. “A Disney Princess” Five years ago, a YouTube video she uploaded featuring her karaoke take on “Don’t Wake Me Up” by Chris Brown earned the attention of an obscure Los Angeles producer named Chris Abraham, who encouraged her to come over. Ms. Petras got three-month tourist visas and slept on studio couches, writing songs and networking tirelessly. Finally, in 2014, a new songwriting partner she had begun working with introduced her to the Stereotypes, the songwriting and producing team who won this year’s Grammys for song and record of the year for “That’s What I Like ” by Bruno Mars. Faded - Kim Petras ft. Lil Aaron (Official Music Video) Video by Kim Petras They gave Ms. Petras use of their studio at no charge and connected her to recording artists including JoJo and Fergie. While the song Ms. Petras wrote for Fergie wasn’t released, it created enough buzz to land her a publishing deal with BMG. The publishing company connected her to the producer Dr. Luke, who had been keeping a low profile in the wake of the 2014 allegations by Kesha that he had sexually abused her and kept her in contractual servitude. Ms. Petras and Dr. Luke began working on tracks, including “I Don’t Want It at All.” (While she has been criticized for working with him, she said that her experience “has been amazing. He’s been nothing but supportive.”) Dr. Luke introduced Ms. Petras to Mr. Rudolph, who fell in love with her immediately. “I’m in the star business,” Mr. Rudolph said, “and she’s a star.” He considered her transgender identity to be “a strong footnote, but a footnote” he said. “I wouldn’t have gotten involved if I didn’t think she was the real deal.” Likewise, many of her fans are drawn to her music first, before they know her personal story. They like the “fact that I’m unapologetically pop,” she said. “It’s very different from what’s in the mainstream now, which is more rhythmic. Also, they love that I’m serving looks in my music videos.” Celebrities have also been supportive. Charli XCX asked her to perform on a song, “Unlock It,” which also features the rapper Jay Park. And Paris Hilton leapt at the chance to play herself as a pivotal character in the video for “I Don’t Want It at All.” “As soon as I walked on the set I thought, ‘Oh my God, we look like sisters,’” Ms. Hilton said. “I always thought of myself almost like a cartoon character, like a Barbie doll. She’s iconic like that.” In the scenario for Ms. Petras’s forthcoming video for “Heart to Break,” she took a cue from some fans. “On the internet, there was talk about me as a trans Disney princess,” she said. “So we thought, ‘What would that look like?’” Should the video blow up, Ms. Petras would break fresh queer-pop ground. “I don’t care about being the first transgender teen idol at all,” she said, before taking a final spin on a seat swirled with candy cane colors. “I just want to be known as a great musician.” Two seconds later, she reconsidered: “On the other hand, that would be totally sick.” A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2018, on Page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: Princess of Gloss.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","An Indonesian man is pictured walking inside a damaged room in the Banyumas regional public hospital after a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Banyumas, Central Java, Indonesia killed at least two people. (Photo: Bayu Nur, EPA-EFE) JAKARTA, Indonesia — A strong earthquake shook Indonesia’s densely populated Java island on Friday night, killing two people and severely damaging dozens of homes near the epicenter. The magnitude-6.5 quake struck at 11:47 p.m. and was felt across the island, including about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away in the capital Jakarta, where office towers and apartment buildings swayed. Powerful tremors lasted as much as 30 seconds in places. Panicking people ran out of buildings in many areas and roads were clogged with motorbikes, cars and trucks as people fled coastal areas in fear of a tsunami. Ahmad Solihin, a food vendor in a coastal area of the Sukabumi region, said his village was jolted by a 20-second tremor that cracked walls in his home. He fled on his motorbike with his wife and two children after neighbors shouted that water was coming, he said. “People suddenly started running so I joined them,” said Solihin. More than 1,000 villagers in his area evacuated to higher ground and didn’t return until Saturday morning after authorities convinced them it was safe, he said. A 62-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman were killed in building collapses, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Damage was heaviest in the Tasikmalaya, Pangandaran and Ciamis regions of West Java Province near the epicenter. More than 40 houses collapsed and about 65 suffered severe damage, said Nugroho. The earthquake was about 91 kilometers (56 miles) deep and located just inland, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It triggered a tsunami warning for parts of Java’s coastline that was lifted about two hours later. No significant waves were reported. Several hospitals were damaged by the shaking and patients evacuated. Indonesia sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire” and has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Eighty percent of homeless people in Los Angeles live on the street or in public parks. Last year, voters approved a ballot measure that expects to raise about $4.7 billion in the next decade for affordable housing and homeless services.

Peter Burnett was the first governor of the State of California, ascending to the post on December 20, 1849. But his ignominious legacy is hardly known today. Mr. Burnett came from Missouri via Oregon, settling near Sacramento amid the Gold Rush. Just as he had done in Oregon, Mr. Burnett pushed to exclude blacks from the state. While he seemed to couch his argument in antislavery terms, he was merely “disguising” his “equal opportunity racism,” said William Deverell, a historian and the director of the Huntington-U.S.C. Institute on California and the West. “He was not particularly unusual at all at the time,” Mr. Deverell said. “That’s when the really vicious attacks on Native Americans started coming and gave way to genocidal violence. He was early opponent of the Chinese, which leads to the exclusion act. He really shows you can be antislavery and a racist to the core without any difficulty whatsoever.” Though he is included in fourth grade state history, Mr. Burnett’s name has largely been erased from the public sphere. His name was on a San Francisco preschool as well as an elementary school in Long Beach, but was recently taken down and replaced at both schools after reports of his views and statements resurfaced. “He talked in this undeniably ugly way about people, so we should talk about how we’ve honored him,” Mr. Deverell said. “These are not issues that are reserved for other parts of the United States without resonance in California.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Associated Press,"(TEHRAN) — Iranian state TV says a 7.2-magnitude earthquake has jolted the region near the border between Iran and Iraq. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the quake on its website, placing its epicenter at around 32km (19 miles) outside the Iraqi city of Halabja, and issuing an “orange” alert for “shaking-related fatalities and economic losses.” The semi-official Iranian ILNA news agency reported that at least 14 provinces had been impacted by the earthquake. Iranian social media was abuzz with posts of people evacuating their homes, especially from the cities of Ghasr-e Shirin (near Iraqi border) and Kermanshah. Faramarz Akbari, Ghasr-e Shirin’s governor, said that six people had died and scores more injured, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Esmail Najar, head of Iran’s National Disaster Management Organization, said “some injured people might be buried under the rubble in Ghasr-e Shirin”.

Megan Geuss,"Enlarge / A high-altitude nuclear detonation captured on decades-old film at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. reader comments 1 This week, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) released another 62 declassified nuclear explosion test videos on the lab’s YouTube channel. These videos follow an earlier batch of nuclear test videos that were released by LLNL in March. The videos depict atmospheric nuclear tests carried out by the US between 1945 and 1962. Often, the detonations were filmed by as many as 50 different cameras at different angles, locations, and frame speeds. Over time, the US military racked up some 10,000 films from 210 tests. The films sat in storage for decades until nuclear physicist Gregg Spriggs was asked to model the effects of nuclear explosions, according to an LLNL press release. Spriggs’ model didn’t correspond to information that was published contemporary with the actual tests in the 50s and 60s, so he started digging out old nuclear test films to reanalyze the explosions and fact-check his data against the manually-recorded historical data. In some cases, Spriggs found that the decades-old, manually-recorded data was off by as much as 30 percent. That spurred an initiative to reanalyze all of the nuclear test video footage available, in order to confirm that the nuclear yield of each test was accurately recorded. Accurate yield data (that is, data on how much energy a weapon releases) helps scientists certify the nuclear stockpile. “These are devastating weapons, and I hope they’re never used in war,” Spriggs said in the LLNL press release. “But the stockpile has been an effective deterrent for more than 70 years. My hope is that this project can help to make sure it stays viable into the future.” The video-scanning project has required the expertise of rare film expert Jim Moye, who cleans the films and scans them twice in a professional film scanner in order to capture the most exact gradations of color and black and white possible. Many of the films are already decaying after careless storage, so digitization will help preserve the database for future generations. The videos released this week include footage of the “Harlem Event,” a 1.2 megaton atmospheric detonation above Christmas Island in 1962. The video below shows how nuclear explosions can result in two distinct flashes of light. The first flash happens when the shockwave is formed, but quickly the superheated air around the blast epicenter “shields the light from inside the fireball,” according to LLNL. “As the shockwave cools to below 3,300 Kelvin, the air becomes transparent and the hot gasses begin to show through, creating the second pulse.” Measuring the time between these two flashes, as well as the darkest frame between the two flashes, can help calculate the blast’s yield. Similarly, the “Bighorn Event” (also a 1962 test over Christmas Island) shows a more distinctive fireball and mushroom cloud. “The speed at which the mushroom cloud rises and the height of the cloud can be used to calculate yield,” LLNL writes. Other metrics by which researchers can measure test yield is the glow time and speed of growth of the initial fireball created by the explosion. A video of the 1955 “Turk Event” released this week occurred just above the desert floor at the Nevada Test Site.",Tracking nuclear double-pulse phenomenon helps scientists determine explosive yield.,2017-12-17T22:00:38Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",More haunting declassified scans of nuclear weapons test videos released,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/more-haunting-declassified-scans-of-nuclear-weapons-test-videos-released/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/filmpreservation-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,epicenter,1
James Gagliano,"James A. Gagliano is a CNN law enforcement analyst and a retired FBI supervisory special agent. He also serves as an adjunct assistant professor at St. John's University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesAGagliano. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) The stunning news that surfaced a week after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was hard to digest. An armed Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) deputy, Scot Peterson, assigned as a school resource officer, was on duty on that February afternoon. And yet he remained outside of the freshman building during the slaughter. Peterson's lawyer claimed the way he acted was ""appropriate under the circumstances,"" and that he did not run into the school because he thought the gunfire was coming from outside. He further added that ""allegations that Mr. Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers are patently untrue."" Nonetheless, Peterson has since resigned and an investigation has been opened. It's important to remember that after the 1999 Columbine shooting, there were new protocols established to address an active school shooter. A review of the law enforcement response at Columbine concluded that arriving officers elected not to enter the school buildings until a SWAT team arrived and made entry some 47 minutes after the first shots were fired. In the business of saving lives, minutes -- and even seconds -- count. Awaiting the arrival and assembly of a SWAT team is therefore no longer the preferred practice. Instead, whoever is on scene is supposed to confront the shooter immediately, with the understanding that backup will be on the way. Peterson's failure to follow the immediate interdiction protocol shows that the lessons of Columbine have not yet been fully implemented and embraced. Now I know not every member of law enforcement is a hero. And just like in every profession, some are better suited for the ""business"" than others. But sound training also conditions officers to control their fears and act heroically. Tactics learned in law enforcement academies and in-service training contribute to this response conditioning. And in the almost 19 years since the Columbine shooting, law enforcement has reflected on the lessons learned from that massacre and adopted tactics to counter an evolving threat. What was so unique about Columbine was that it was wholly unexpected and involved attackers in a bucolic suburban setting -- like Parkland. And the police response was based on law enforcement's contextual understanding of hostage situations. In other words, law enforcement tactics in 1999 were still hopelessly rooted in the 1975 bank standoff tactics in Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Responding police agencies at Columbine assembled in staging areas and formed a standard police perimeter. Thinking at the time was centered on the theory of ""contain and negotiate."" What made Columbine unique in law enforcement annals was that the depraved killers were simply intent on racking up a large body count, with no real intention of surviving the attack. Therefore, containment became an archaic approach. And waiting for a SWAT team to arrive and interdict a barricaded subject became an outdated construct. Training in the early 2000s focused on the immediate coalescing of disparate arriving law enforcement elements into tactical formations that immediately moved toward the epicenter of danger. Local departments and state agencies began to train closely with their federal counterparts. And the new tactics became universally adopted. The FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, located within the US Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia, has hosted active shooter training for units like the New York State Police's Special Operations Response Team. And FBI SWAT teams frequently host local police departments to share ""best practices"" and to ensure seamless coordination -- known as interoperability -- when responding officers from different departments converge on a scene. In March 2014, the Police Executive Research Forum drafted another treatise in their ""Critical Issues in Policing"" series: ""The Police Response to Active Shooter Incidents."" Beyond the obvious acknowledgment that Columbine was the catalyst for tactical rethinking, it focused on an Associated Press accounting that highlighted the post-Columbine tactics shift: ""A deadly shooting at an Indiana grocery store could have been much worse if not for the quick actions of two police officers who relied on training that has become commonplace since the 1999 Columbine shootings. Cody Skipper and Jason Tripp arrived at the Elkhart store within three minutes and needed less than 60 seconds to fatally shoot a gunman who had killed two people and was threatening a third."" Responding Officers Skipper and Tripp skipped the first procedural step in the outdated ""contain and negotiate"" protocol -- establish a perimeter -- and moved immediately to confront the gunman. They didn't await arrival of a tactical team. While their actions assuredly presented more risk of danger to themselves, it undoubtedly saved lives. So now that local reporting from the Miami-Herald charges that a BSO captain who arrived to take charge of the scene in Parkland issued a command directive to ""form a perimeter,"" it may be indicative of department protocols that were not updated after Columbine. Sheriff Scott Israel, who actually hired the on-scene commander, Captain Jan Jordan, refutes that notion. He has stated he concurs with the national police consensus that places a priority on immediately confronting a shooter, rather than securing a scene. Israel also maintains that his department's sworn members are trained in these accepted practices. But the BSO dispatch log obtained by the Miami-Herald indicates that is not what occurred. And that's unconscionable and may have led to the loss of more student and teacher lives. Let's hope that the deep-dive investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement into the factors that contributed to this tragedy provides us some answers.

Sara Ashley O'Brien,"That's a fancy way of saying the two companies want a role in all of the ways you get from point A to point B. Ultimately, they don't really care how you get around, so long as you're doing it on their platform. Two recent moves underscore just how serious they are about this. On Monday, Lyft announced its acquisition of Motivate, the largest bike-share operator in North America. That followed news that Uber is launching a ""new modalities"" unit to lead its expansion into bikes, scooters, and more. ""There's no doubt both companies want to become full spectrum transportation providers,"" said Junfeng Jiao, an assistant professor of community and regional planning at University of Texas at Austin. Uber, which, at a valuation of around $62 billion is worth about four times as much as Lyft, leads the race so far. In April, it snapped up Jump, a bike-sharing service that operates in 40 cities. The company also has brokered deals with the peer-to-peer car sharing startup Getaround and with Masabi, which does mobile ticketing for public transit. It's all part of CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's plan to make Uber your go-to transportation service. The job of making that happen falls to Rachel Holt, who will lead the modalities unit. She made her name at leading Uber's US and Canadian operations. When she joined nearly seven years ago, Uber operated in just three markets. That number now stands at 630 worldwide. Khosrowshahi wants her to apply the same expansion strategies to these new ventures, starting with bike sharing. Holt told CNNMoney that Uber has ""aggressive plans"" to expand Jump's business. Aggressive is a loaded word for Uber, however, because the company's rapid expansion under founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick often saw it butting heads with regulators and municipal leaders. Khosrowshahi has taken a more tactful approach since taking over in August. Related: Lyft acquires Citi Bike parent company, Motivate Holt said she hasn't mapped out any benchmarks for growth, and says she believes cities will find Uber's embrace of other transportation options attractive. ""The more we can have a holistic solution to a city's needs, the better,"" she said. ""In many cases, we now have very, very strong relationships with cities. Having multiple options aside from just cars will continue to make those relationships even closer."" Uber, like Lyft, also sees e-scooters playing a big role in urban transport. The company has applied for one of five permits San Francisco (the epicenter of the e-scooter craze) will issue, but Holt says it is too early to say whether Uber will develop its own scooters or make a strategic acquisition to get in the game. The rapid infusion of cash into e-scooter startups all but requires Uber and Lyft to move into the space. Bird raised $400 million in four months and is now valued at $2 billion. Lime, another big player, hopes to raise another $300 million at valuation north of $1 billion, according to new paperwork filed in Delaware Tuesday. Related: Uber buys a bikeshare company as it looks to expand beyond cars Uber and Lyft watched those companies hit billion-dollar valuations far faster than they did, ""so they're paying attention,"" said Daniel Sperling, the founding director of the UC-Davis Institute of Transportation Studies and author of ""Three Revolutions."" Sperling said exploring new modes of transportation is ""well aligned"" with public interests and the companies' own long-term goals. ""It's part of playing a bigger role in a 'passenger-on-demand' service space,"" he said. E-scooters and bikes may seem like niche markets, but they help Uber and Lyft solve the so-called ""last mile"" problem, said Erick Guerra, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on urban planning. The last mile refers to helping people get from, say, a subway station or carpooling location to their final destination. Scooters and bikes are great ways of doing that, said Jonathan Levine, a University of Michigan professor of urban and regional planning. ""Policymakers should welcome the entry of big players into that market,"" he said. Of course, all of this depends upon Uber and Lyft playing nicely with regulators, city officials, and city residents -- many of who express disdain for the high-tech scooters and bikes already littering their streets. Any efforts to expand into new forms of transportation will need to be in tandem with conversations about safety, public access, and working with the communities that will be affected, Levine said. Assuming those conversations go well, you may one day soon ride a scooter to a train in the morning and hail a car home in the evening -- all within the same app. CNNMoney (New York) First published July 3, 2018: 3:25 PM ET",The two ride-sharing giants are racing to diversify beyond ride-sharing.,2018-07-03T19:25:50Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Uber and Lyft want to be about more than cars,https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/03/technology/uber-lyft-bikes-scooters/index.html,https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180703093336-lyft-uber-bike-share-780x439.jpg,cnn,CNN,epicenter,1

Alexis Levinson,"MIAMI Last week, 11 people were murdered during a baby naming ceremony at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Two people were killed in a grocery store in Kentucky by a man who had previously tried, and failed, to enter a predominately black church. A man sent at least a dozen pipe bombs to a media outlet and various public officials who had been publicly critical of President Donald Trump. South Florida often finds itself at the epicenter of chaos, political and otherwise, and the last week was no exception. It was here that the attempted pipe-bomber lived in his van, here where he was arrested last week, and here where he appeared in court on Monday. It was here where one of the intended recipients of one of those bombs, Sen. Kamala Harris, campaigned for gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum this weekend, a governors race that has been marked with allegations of racism. And here where another intended bomb recipient, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, reckoned with the recent spike in anti-Semitic violence at an event in her district, an area that is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the country. But in a political moment that has been defined by chaos, these events, though theyve invoked powerful emotions, seemed to have little impact on the political tides. On the campaign trail, there was still just one week left until Election Day. The future of the health care system still hung in the balance. Trump still had a political rally to go to. The show goes on. It will no doubt be a bitter week of politics leading up to the election, predicted Rep. Ted Deutch, who represents Parkland, where students were massacred in a school shooting earlier this year, toward the end of a Monday press conference at the Jewish Federation of Broward County, where Deutch, Wasserman Schultz, and other speakers mourned those killed and lamented political rhetoric that is too hot and too dangerous. A Sunday rally for former Rep. Ron DeSantis, the Republican gubernatorial hopeful, began with calls for justice for the victims of the Pittsburgh shooting. Minutes later, the crowd was chanting lock him up, after DeSantis turned his focus to criticizing his Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum. At a rally Monday afternoon for Gillum, a scuffle broke out around a protester holding a sign that read God Bless the NRA, a sign that Gillum supporters took great pains to block by holding up their own campaign signs. As former attorney general Eric Holder spoke on the stage, the game of cat-and-mouse with signs turned into a skirmish, and law enforcement officials intervened. The man, James Hammers, told BuzzFeed News after that he was there to protest Gillums stances on guns, gay rights, abortion, and taxes. The man is evil, and everyone who supports him is evil, he said. Another protester taunted Holder and Gillum with a megaphone as they spoke, asking them if they would denounce mob violence, and attacking Holder for his comment earlier this month that bent a Michelle Obama catch phrase into, When they go low, we kick em. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Holder scoffed from the stage. Why dont you cut out the fake outrage, my man? Many Democrats blamed Trump, saying his aggressive rhetoric likely inspired the perpetrators of these violent events. We all have a responsibility to turn the volume down and speak with compassion. Words can be weaponized, and vitriolic words can foment violence in a human powder keg, said Wasserman Schultz, standing next to Deutch Monday morning, as 11 candles burned in memory of those who died in Pittsburgh. They inform, inflame, and, I fear, can even trigger the horrific threats and violence that we are now seeing. The President of the United States, in particular, needs to understand that his words resonate and matter and reach further than anyone in the world, she added later. Ive been saying it for a long time, there are a lot of powerful voices frankly that I think are sowing hate and division among Americans. I think its irresponsible, and it is harmful to who we are as a country, Harris told reporters after a campaign event with Gillums wife, when asked if the presidents rhetoric was in part responsible for the events of the past week. Trump creates this atmosphere that allows the worst elements to think that they have a right to do things that are just horrific, Donna Shalala, a former Health and Human Services secretary who is running for a Miami-based House seat, told BuzzFeed News in an interview at her campaign office Monday. But its the atmosphere hes created, the culture that hes created, the lock em up rallies that he has, the fact that he says, yeah its all right to go beat someone up. Its not all right to beat anyone up. Last week, two members of the far-right mens group Proud Boys joined a planned Republican protest outside Shalalas office when House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi came to stump with her, and the scene turned aggressive, with protesters banging on the door of her campaign office. On Sunday, 250 miles north, shots were fired into the Volusia County Republican Party office. No one was hurt. Shalala said the distress she was hearing over the past week, and what role Trumps rhetoric may have played in it, was part and parcel with what voters had been telling her about Trump since the beginning. I have never been in Florida in a voting, in an election in which people said to me, 'Im voting the Democratic slate,' she said, adding: Im sensing that people have in their minds that we have to have a checkmate on this administration. In many ways, people seemed to process the horrific events of last week the way they have processed so much of the last year: as evidence to reinforce what they already believed to be true. Anything anti-Trump is good, said David Kaufman, leaving an early voting place in Miami. The violence of the past week hadnt impacted his decision in any way, he said. Hed already decided. Brad, who declined to give his last name, had a similar reaction. I usually just vote Republican, he told BuzzFeed News, and this year had been no different. The violence of the past week, if anything, served to reinforce what I think for instance, he said, that its important to support the police, something he saw as more of a Republican idea. Some Democrats went further than others, calling out Republicans for not doing enough to check this rhetoric out of the White House. I watched a lot of television this morning, and its so disappointing because the person who needs to be leading is not, but no one else is calling him on it either, R. Jai Gillum, the gubernatorial candidates wife, said at an event with Harris Sunday. I think that its a time for all of us to take a serious look at the state of our political division, said Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democrat challenging Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo in the neighboring Miami district. And I mean everyone should take personal responsibility in how they relate to each other. I think someone like Congressman Curbelo and the Republican Party, they need to take a hard look on what type of tactics theyre using in their campaign to instigate some of this political divide and violence. Pressed on her use of the word instigate, a verb that goes a step farther than many Democrats have gone in blaming Republican rhetoric for the violence, Mucarsel Powell elaborated: I think that anyone that uses hateful language against people they dont agree with politically can instigate the divide and the violence. Curbelo, in a statement to BuzzFeed News, also called for public officials singling out the president to pay attention to their rhetoric. ""Every citizen and the media have a role to play in addressing the violence in our politics. However, leadership starts at the top. Public leaders, from the President down to local officials, need to do better. Its why Ive called out and condemned things the President has said, as well as the actions of Democratic colleagues like the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for embracing bigotry and the segregation of America's Hispanic community, he said. I agree we should each take personal responsibility and look at how we relate to each other, but its disappointing someone calling for that would in the same breath launch a completely unsubstantiated and dishonest attack, he added, of Mucarsel-Powells comments. It's clear my opponent would contribute to the chaos and lack of civility in Washington. While I've been working to bridge the partisan divide, she's made it clear her preference is to exacerbate it for personal gain."" I think that anyone that uses hateful language against people they dont agree with politically can instigate the divide and the violence. Wasserman Schultz proposed concrete action to follow what had happened this week: social media companies, she said, needed to put regulations in place to shut down accounts of people expressing the violence-tinged anger that was found on the accounts of both the attempted bomber and the shooter. If they did not do so, she said, the government should step in. I have stood up for the First Amendment when it wasnt popular, on things that, on things that people criticized me for. But the people who run Twitter and other social media outlets have to make sure that they have standards in place that can take down the modern day equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater, Wasserman Schultz said. She highlighted Twitter as, she said, the worst actor in this with an absolutely outrageous, lax, unacceptable policy for take down. Our First Amendment means something, but we also have had the Supreme Court of the United States lay out limits, and I dont think that our social media explosion, our social media policies have adapted to adhere to those limits, she added. And they should. In a moment where horrors that might once have reconfigured the political landscape now often wash away in the stream of steady chaos, some wondered how long these terrible acts would even stay at the forefront. In Judaism, we never forget the names, said Rabbi Hector Epelbaum, who spoke at the event with Wasserman Schultz and Deutch. But, he said, he feared most people had already forgotten most of the names of those killed in Parkland, just 30 minutes away from where he was speaking Monday. That will be the most painful issue here, he said. Not to forget who they were. Not to forget who we are.","“The man is evil, and everyone who supports him is evil,” one Florida voter said on Monday.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Breaking news. (Photo: USA TODAY) TAIPEI, Taiwan – A strong and shallow earthquake struck off Taiwan’s east coast on Sunday night, but there were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.1 quake’s epicenter was 9 miles northeast of the city of Hualien, at a depth of just 4.9 miles. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones. Taiwan’s Central News Agency said the island’s earthquake monitoring agency registered seven tremors around that time, with the strongest recorded at a magnitude of 5.8 and a depth of 10 miles. Earthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage. However, a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people. In 2016, a shallow earthquake in southern Taiwan killed at least two dozen people.

Rosie Mattio,"September 24, 2018 3 min read Opinions expressed by Green Entrepreneur contributors are their own. The Golden State is the political and cultural epicenter of the legal cannabis movement. Though it wasnt the first state to legalize adult use (Colorado holds that distinction), its Cali that leads the way in terms of revenue and overall size of the market. In fact, California is the biggest legal cannabis market in the world -- larger than entire countries such as Canada and Uruguay, combined. The current trends that are expanding east and internationally, like chic edibles and instantly potent vaporizer pen kits, all started on the left coast. Here are the three west coast trends influencing the cannabis world today. Related: California Unleashes a Massive Market for Legal Cannabis 1. Craft &amp; Small-Batch Products Farm-to-table isnt just a food trend. Whether for health, quality, or ethical reasons, people want to smoke farm fresh cannabis, too. More and more consumers desire a tangible connection with the cannabis flower and care about small farm values such as sustainability, craftsmanship, organic principles, and hands-on cultivation techniques -- ideally, using plenty of real California sun and soil. These brands will build in value over time as the trend continues to shift toward all-natural foods and cannabis. 2. Luxury Lifestyle In contrast to the bespoke craft cannabis movement, are brand names who exploded onto the scene with unique and expensive items that score big points in the style department. These products are meant for, and in fact, often created by, the upper echelon of cannabis consumers. Hollywood and Silicon Valley types may not frequent the popular storefront dispensaries, but luckily, home delivery is legal in California and perfect for those who wish to make their cannabis purchases incognito. Related: The Evolving Cannabis Market Offers Limitless Opportunities 3. Beachy Branding Artistic elements like palm trees, surfboards, driftwood, and bright pastels have always screamed California - now these aesthetics are dominating the cannabis industry. Brands are embodying the beach and surf culture in order to become synonymous with the west coast mentality. Calivas palm tree-clad packages dominate the Bay Area and much of southern California, and walking into its dispensary home base in San Jose feels much like entering a surf shop. Cold fizzy drinks are also a big hit year-round with the California crowd, like the fruity, low-calorie natural beverages from Mood33, and California Dreamin' low-dose sodas. Not every California resident has access to the ocean, but with these products, they can easily feel the vibe.

Nick Douglas,"Futurist Amy Webb has led the Future Today Institute since today...was the future. That sounds less profound than we hoped, but Webb’s work is profound. Since Webb founded it in 2006, Future Today has analyzed trends in culture and technology for clients including Microsoft, American Express, Univision (Lifehacker’s current parent company), the White House, and the Federal Reserve. She’s also published two books and given the TED talk “How I Hacked Dating.” We talked to her about the perfect carry-on bag, differences between media technology around the world, and the method her Institute uses to efficiently break up their work day. Location: NYC Current Gig: Quantitative futurist, professor of Strategic Foresight at NYU Stern School of Business, founder of the Future Today Institute One word that best describes how you work: Methodically Current mobile device: Samsung S9 Current computer: Mac Pro First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. In sixth grade, I joined our middle school Future Problem Solvers of America team, and without realizing it I began my work as a futurist when I was just 11 years old. In college I took a multidisciplinary course of study, which included economics, game theory, political science, computer science and music. After graduating, I worked as foreign correspondent in China and Japan and spent my 20s living at the epicenter of emerging technologies like smartphones and haptic screens, and I was seeing early, nascent successes with machine learning. When I moved back to the U.S., I had a difficult time fitting back in to a traditional newsroom environment. I was convinced that news needed a radically different business model to sustain quality journalism—but I grew tired of apathy towards emerging tech, so I quit. I secured seed funding to start an R&amp;D lab for news and media, and my focus was on exploring and building new digital distribution techniques. As my team experimented with new prototypes, I became interested in much broader topics beyond journalism—like how the third era of computing (AI) would impact every facet of everyday life, how technology influenced the geopolitical balance, and how our data might become a primary driver of the economy. I wanted to model and map plausible scenarios for what that future might look like, and that’s when a colleague pointed me to the work of early futurists like Robert Jungk and Alvin Toffler, and of the quantitative modeling developed by Olaf Helmer and Nicholas Rescher. I took classes in strategic foresight, read everything I could get my hands on, and pivoted in 2006, when I started the Future Today Institute. I’ve been working full-time as a quantitative futurist ever since. I now teach foresight at NYU’s Stern School of Business, and my students are incredibly bright and creative. I also write—I’m finishing my third book now. It’s a manifesto about how the “Big Nine” tech titans are shaping the future of AI. (They are Google, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba.) My most recent book, The Signals Are Talking, explains my foresight methodology and explains how to use the tools of a futurist to see over the horizon. Take us through a recent workday. Every day at work is different—sometimes I’m at the office, but often I’m on the road—so I’ll offer you two recent workdays. On the road: One of our clients is a global petroleum company, and I worked on-site with a team of 15 people to map near-future risk/opportunity scenarios. We began the session with a deep dive into the Future Today Institute’s forecasting methodology and an explanation of the different dimensions of disruption. Then we mapped weak signals—issues that help us identify emerging changes own the horizon. That was followed by intensive hands-on work. The session lasted about seven hours. I caught a red-eye home after we finished. At the office: I’m completing my next book. On book writing days, I get to my office by 7am and write until 4pm, without taking any breaks. Then from 4pm - 7pm I’m in meetings and answering email. How do you focus for 9 hours without breaks? The way I stay focused for so long—I think—is a combination of the brown noise, my earphones, and the exercise ball I sit on instead of a regular chair. I get up to use the washroom, of course, and I usually snack on nuts and dried fruit. Turning off my phones and keeping social media and email locked away have meant a tremendous surge in productivity. I don’t believe in multitasking. In my case, the quality of my work is degraded when I try to do more than one thing at a time. Knowing that there won’t be outside interruptions—tweets, texts, Slack pings—has allowed me to center my entire focus on just one, singular task. What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without? I listen to brown noise on Spotify. I’ve experimented with different sounds and music, and because I’m more sensitive to higher frequencies, brown noise helps me focus intensively. It’s amazing how well it works. I listen on Jabra Elite 65t bluetooth noise cancelling earbuds. When I’m writing, I use the Desktop Curtain to block out all distractions. Because of my intense travel schedule, I spent many years searching for the perfect bag—one that could carry all my gear, plus an extra pair of shoes and a water bottle. For me, Tumi Sheppard Deluxe Brief Pack is just right. It has a sleeve that lets me secure it to my suitcase, which means that I’m no longer carrying anything heavy on my back. What’s your workspace setup like? I have two monitors—one vertical, one horizontal. Everything that’s office or communication-related (Slack, calendar, email) goes on the vertical monitor and stays active. All of my writing happens on the horizontal monitor. My office is covered in Idea Paint. We converted one entire wall, top to bottom, into a whiteboard surface. Many of the other surfaces are made of glass, allowing us to write with whiteboard markers wherever we need to, whether that’s on the windows, tables or chairs. What’s your best shortcut or life hack? It’s something I learned from Ben Franklin: get the big, gnarly hard work out of the way first, when your mind is fully charged. Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work. Our workdays are divided into 20-minute units, and we use math to set every part of our schedules. We keep telephone calls/video calls to 1 unit, and most of our administrative meetings are 2 units. Certain strategy work takes 12 units. We’ve found that blocking out the day in units has resulted in much better and more realistic time management. The 20-minute system is something that I developed for myself in college. I worked two jobs and was at one point attempting five majors, so I had to make every single minute of every day count. (I even had to optimize my sleep, because during my junior year I was only able to get four hours at a time.) I found that dividing the day into hours didn’t allow me to get everything done—I’d either set my expectations way too low or too high. The hour convention works well for groups who need to tell time, but I don’t think it works as well for productivity. For example, I learned that if I have 40 minutes rather than an hour to complete a task, I’m likely to focus and work harder. Meetings that last an hour tend to include a lot of wasted, unproductive moments. The 20-minute unit system is definitely an adjustment for people who work with me. If I have 40 minutes rather than an hour to complete a task, I’m likely to focus and work harder.﻿ Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them? Our team is distributed—we work out of spaces in many different cities and don’t have a central physical hub. Collectively, we can’t function without our director of operations, Cheryl Cooney. She is the engine that keeps me, and the Future Today Institute, running. She manages and executes all of the decisions that don’t require my direct involvement. How do you keep track of what you have to do? We have a three-tiered system of delegation: immediate, the next few days, and longer-term. We allocate in advance the number of units required to complete all of these tasks. We’ve experimented with various task management software, like Trello and Asana, but ultimately I’ve found that a combination of Slack, Google docs and a physical notebook works best for me. How do you recharge or take a break? I break a sweat daily—usually spinning or jogging. Paradoxically, wearing myself out exercising is the best way to recharge. I also try to get outdoors at some point during my work day, to take a walk to just sit in the sun for a few minutes. What’s your favorite side project? I consult on TV shows and movies, helping talented show runners, writers, producers and production staff see the future. Most recently, I worked with Beau Willimon and his team on The First, which is his upcoming series on Hulu and portrays members of a team of astronauts as they become the first humans to visit Mars. It’s set in the year 2031 and it stars Sean Penn and Natascha McElhone. What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend? I just finished Borne by Jeff VanderMeer and am currently reading The Power by Naomi Alderman. They are both terrific. Who else would you like to see answer these questions? Michio Kaku. What’s the best advice you’ve ever received? My mentor, MJ Ryan, taught me to work incrementally. Mountains are climbed by taking a series of steps. With each and every project, I need to think about all of the steps first, without losing sight of the summit. She’s trained me to think about the present and future simultaneously. What’s a problem you’re still trying to solve? My goal is to democratize the tools of futurists, and to get every decision maker to think more about the farther future.

View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) New York City's recent decision to place a one-year cap on new for-hire vehicle licenses is a sad example of government favoritism for the yellow taxi industry against fair-market competitors like Uber and Lyft. This will hurt poor and minority riders and entrepreneurs, and subject New Yorkers, like myself, further to the subway system's depressing 70,000 delays per month. What's happening in New York City right now is a case study that could spawn global copycats, as Europe, China and cities like Austin, Seattle and San Francisco target ride-share technology. New York City is an example of how innovation is endangered by overzealous government regulations shielding incumbent businesses, supposedly in the name of protecting customers. Ostensibly the cap is to give New York City time to temporarily study the industry. But if the cap never ends, then we shouldn't be shocked; as Ronald Reagan would tell us, the closest thing to eternal life is government bureaucracy. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned to improve the lives of poor and everyday New Yorkers, who deserve much better than this pay-to-play The taxi industry has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to de Blasio's campaign and has also donated to members of the City Council, including Rubén Díaz Sr., chairman of the city's Committee on For-Hire Vehicles. Commenting on this support back in 2012, de Blasio said, ""I am obviously going to go out and raise money for a campaign from a wide variety of sources; other candidates are going to do the same."" Díaz, meanwhile, has said that this support will not affect his work, stating, ""I am not for sale, I am not for hire, and I am not for lease."" The big problem with a cap on app-based drivers like Uber and Lyft is their incredibly high turnover -- Lyft estimates the annual industry churn is at least 25%, for example. Drivers who quit can't be replaced, which would mean fewer drivers, longer wait times for customers, and a spike in rider fees. For immigrants and people of color -- many of whom rely on these ride-sharing apps to supplement their income -- the opportunity to manage their own schedule and support their families just got smaller. City leaders say that the cap will help improve congestion (even though many of them opposed a proposal for congestion pricing), yet customers hurt most by sparser car availability are those New Yorkers living in the outer boroughs -- where there is less traffic and where people of color are more likely to live. For example, US Census data shows Manhattan is just 18% black, compared to 34% of Brooklyn and 44% of the Bronx. Manhattan is just 26% Latino, compared to 56% of the Bronx. Jared Meyer, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability, had access to proprietary Uber data showing app-based rides are a lifeline for people in the Bronx and Queens. FiveThirtyEight reported on data for 4.4 million Uber rides showing a pickup location, and 22% started outside of Manhattan, compared with just 14% of the 88.4 million traditional taxi rides. ""The question to ask with each new regulation is: who is actually being protected -- the public or special interests?"" Meyer wrote in his book, ""Uber-Positive: Why Americans Love the Sharing Economy."" ""De Blasio's misguided attacks on ride sharing threaten the growth of a system that has achieved what yellow taxis were never able to -- expanding transportation options for low-income outer-borough New Yorkers."" As The Wall Street Journal pointed out, ""civil rights groups and Rev. Al Sharpton oppose the for-hire cap. The New York Urban League and the state's NAACP note how hard it once was for minorities to hail a yellow cab or get a return taxi to the Bronx. Most for-hire vehicles are hailed via smartphone, so drivers can't easily discriminate."" Their sentiment was confirmed by panelists during a congressional debate held by Silicon Harlem, a tech an innovation hub in Harlem, an epicenter of African-American culture and history, where, in 2016, I helped co-moderate a congressional debate. During the debate, speakers like Former Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV (son of civil rights pioneer Adam Clayton Powell Jr.) pointed out that many people in the district do not own cars, allowing for tech startups like Uber to serve clientele in African-American and Latino communities that were underserved by the previously undisrupted cab system. During the debate, Keith Wright, another former New York State assemblyman and vocal proponent for civil rights, praised Uber's colorblind call service, and he railed against his inability to catch a cab due to driver bias. It's never too late for the city I love to right its wrongs, preferably before other cities follow suit and learn the hard way that squeezing innovators creates many negative unintended consequences. These consequences hurt the most vulnerable among us.",New York City's recent decision to place a one-year cap on new for-hire vehicle licenses is a sad example of government favoritism for the yellow taxi industry against fair-market competitors like Uber and Lyft.

Raya Jalabi and Parisa Hafezi,"A magnitude 7.3 earthquake killed more than 300 along the Iran/Iraq border. The earthquake trigger landslides that hindered rescue efforts. The head of Iranian Red Crescent said more than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter. A man reacts following an earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah, Iran November 13, 2017. Tasnim News Agency/Handout via REUTERS BAGHDAD/ANKARA (Reuters) - More than 300 people were killed in Iran when a magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday, state media said, and rescuers were searching for dozens trapped under rubble in the mountainous area. At least six have died in Iraq as well. State television said more than 336 people were killed in Iran and at least 3,950 were injured. Local officials said the death toll would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran. The earthquake was felt in several western provinces of Iran, but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah, which announced three days of mourning. More than 236 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border. Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. Rescuers were laboring to find survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television. At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. Dancing buildings A man walks past a damaged building following an earthquake in Darbandikhan in Sulaimaniya Governorate, Iraq, November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Ako Rasheed The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured magnitude 7.3. An Iraqi meteorology official put its magnitude at 6.5 with the epicenter in Penjwin in Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran. Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured. Iraq's health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district's only hospital was severely damaged. The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital. ""I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,"" said Majida Ameer, who ran out of her building in the capital's Salihiya district with her three children. ""I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"" Similar scenes unfolded in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region, and across other cities in northern Iraq, close to the quake's epicenter. Cold weather A wounded boy is treated following an earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah, Iran November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tasnim News Agency Electricity was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. The Iranian seismological center registered around 118 aftershocks and said more were expected. The head of Iranian Red Crescent said more than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter. Hojjat Gharibian was one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, who was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin. ""My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,"" Gharibian told Reuters by telephone. Iran's police, the elite Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij militia forces were dispatched to the quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said some roads were blocked and authorities were worried about casualties in remote villages. An Iranian oil official said pipelines and refineries in the area remained intact. Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Hospital severely damaged On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan, 75 km east of the city of Sulaimaniyah in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region. More than 30 people were injured in the town, according to Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Rasheed told Reuters. The district's main hospital was severely damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said. In Halabja, local officials said a 12-year-old boy died of an electric shock from a falling electric cable. Iraq's meteorology center advised people to stay away from buildings and not to use elevators in case of aftershocks. Turkey and Israel Google Maps Residents of Turkey's southeastern city of Diyarbakir also reported feeling a strong tremor, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties there. Turkish Red Crescent Chairman Kerem Kinik told broadcaster NTV that Red Crescent teams in Erbil were preparing to go to the site of the earthquake and that Turkey’s national disaster management agency, AFAD, and National Medical Rescue Teams were also preparing to head into Iraq. AFAD's chairman said the organization was waiting for a reply to its offer for help. In a tweet, Kinik said the Turkish Red Crescent was gathering 3,000 tents and heaters, 10,000 beds and blankets and moving them toward the Iraqi border. ""We are coordinating with Iranian and Iraqi Red Crescent groups. We are also getting prepared to make deliveries from our northern Iraq Erbil depot,"" he said. Israeli media said the quake was felt in many parts of Israel as well. In a statement, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said, ""My condolences to the people of Iran and Iraq over the loss of human life caused by the earthquake.""

Emily Canal,"Silicon Valley may be the epicenter of the tech industry, but Austin is a more attractive location for workers eager to increase their earning power. Tech employees in Texas's capital received the largest average salary increases in the U.S. between 2016 and 2017, according to a new report by the job search marketplace Hired. The data showed that tech workers in the city made an average of $118,000 annually in 2017, a 7 percent jump from the year before. Workers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. were close behind with a 6 percent salary increase in the same time span, Hired found. ""A couple of things are happening in Austin, a low cost of living, no income tax, and you already had a tech ecosystem there,"" Hired CEO Mehul Patel told Recode. He added that these factors have encouraged companies like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox to invest more in the area and increase average pay for employees. Bay Area companies still pay the highest wages--Hired found the average annual tech salary there was $142,000--but they lag behind when adjusted for cost of living. That's why many workers are looking to other cities where their dollars go further.

Megan Molteni,"The United States might still be home to the global epicenter of technology and innovation, but when it comes to things like voting machines, air traffic control, and sunscreen, the US might as well be running Windows ME. Yep, to find some of the most outdated sun protection products in the world, look no further than the shelves of your local American drugstore. For years, the US Food and Drug Administration dragged its heels to do something about that, even as Europewhich treats sunscreens as cosmetics as opposed to over-the-counter drugsembraced new kinds of solar radiation-stymying schmears, sticks, and sprays.
But no longer!
On Thursday, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced that the agency is finally beginning a process to update the way it regulates sunscreens, in an effort to bring them in line with 21st century science. The US has not approved any new photoprotective molecules, the active ingredients in sunscreen, also known as UV filters, since the Clinton administration. In the meantime, new research has raised concerns about how some of these active ingredients affect the human body and in the environment. Since the initial evaluation of these products, we know much more about the effects of the sun and about sunscreens absorption through the skin, Gottlieb said in a released statement. Todays action is an important step in the FDAs ongoing efforts to take into account modern science to ensure the safety and effectiveness of sunscreens.
For now, the new regulations are just proposals. The public will have 90 days to submit written comments, which the agency will then evaluate before making the rules final. But there are some big changes that could have significant implications for sunscreen manufacturers come November when the FDAs deadline for establishing its updated industry guidelines comes due.
Chief among the changes is the FDAs proposal to re-evaluate the 16 currently approved ingredients on the market. The agency has now classified only twozinc oxide and titanium dioxideout of the 16 as meeting its standards for GRASE, or generally recognized as safe and effective. The agency named PABA and trolamine salicylate as not safe for non-prescription use. And for the remaining 12, even though some of these filters have been in use for decades, the agency feels there isnt sufficient evidence to grant them GRASE status. To prove that they are, the FDA is asking sunscreen-makers to submit additional data, including new tests to measure how the body absorbs those ingredients into the bloodstream and what effects they might have on various tissues, especially over many, chronic applications.
Thus far theres been no indication that any of these 12 UV filters currently on the market are unsafe in humans, says Henry Lim, a dermatologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and the former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. He stresses that people shouldnt panic and dump all their tubes in the trash. Sunscreen, he says, is still an important tool for limiting exposure to ultraviolet rays, a major risk factor for skin cancer. But because of the different nature of these UV filters the FDA wants companies to submit more data from absorption studies.
Different how? Well, the thing youre paying for when you buy a bottle of sunscreen are the molecules that scatter and absorb UV radiation emitted from the ball of hot gas and plasma at the center of the solar system. In order to fend off frequencies that can damage your DNA and lead to cancer-causing mutations these molecules have to be able to block both UVA and UVB wavelengths (about 320-400 and 290-320 nanometers, respectively). These kinds of molecules come in two flavors: organic and inorganic.
Inorganic filters are opaque particlestiny, microscopic chunks of minerals that sit atop your skin in a protective layer, absorbing and reflecting back photons in both the UVA and UVB ranges. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are both inorganic filtersthats why they are almost impossible to rub in and leave their users plastered with a ghostly, sticky pallor.
Organic filters on the other hand can exist in either liquid or solid forms. Their chemical structures allow them to be absorbed into your skin, where they then absorb photons through aromatic rings that dissipate the solar energy in the form of heat. Some organic filters only absorb UVA frequencies, and some only absorb UVB, so different types are frequently combined to achieve broad-spectrum protection. A few filters absorb both types of light, making them among the most widely used ingredients. Among them is oxybenzone, which has become controversial recently for its links to endocrine disruption in animal tests and coral bleaching in laboratory studies.
Oxybenzone is one of the 12 organic UV filters the FDA is asking manufacturers to test further to prove theyre safe and effective in humans. Edgewell Personal Care, maker of Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreens said in a statement emailed to WIRED that it supports the efforts of the FDA and looks forward to working with the agency to ensure we provide consumers with smart choices for sun protection that also meet all relevant regulatory guidelines. Johnson and Johnson, which owns Neutrogena, voiced similar support in an email from a company spokesperson. Bayer, which owns Coppertone, did not respond to requests for comment.
In addition to the proposed regulations on product ingredients, the FDA is also asking manufacturers to submit more data on new forms of sunscreen, like SPF powders, wipes, body washes, and shampoos, before determining if those too are safe. And theyre requiring that all sunscreen products display their active ingredients on the front of the packaging, similar to other over-the-counter drugs.
But what exactly does all this mean for you? In the long-run, the updated rules should lead to more and better choices, by evening the playing field between established companies that have dominated the US market for decades, and foreign sunscreen-makers hoping to get their next-generation UV-filtering molecules approved here. Its great for consumers that the FDA is finally standardizing the industry and holding manufacturers feet to the fire, says Yales David Leffell, one of the nations leading dermatologists.
In the meantime though, hes not changing any of his advice to patients. Skin cancer is still the number-one form of cancer in the US, with more than five million Americans treated for it each year. And while there is evidence that wearing sunscreen decreases your risks of the disease, fewer than 15 percent of men and 30 percent of women in the US regularly use it. Leffell says that in the last few years hes seen an uptick in his patients asking for inorganic sunscreens, and hes happy to make recommendations. But at the end of the day the best sunscreen is the one you dont mind putting on, he says.

Bryan Clark,"Nestled on the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville is a gritty, yet often picturesque representation of middle America. It’s got star power in droves and offers affordable living sure to attract refugees from either coast — or those fleeing parts of middle America for greener pastures. It’s vibrant, rich, and perfect for both savvy singles and young families. What it’s not is the next Silicon Valley. Neither is Columbus, Reno, or Denver. Seattle? Nope. D.C.? Not a chance. Detroit? Nuh uh. Austin, Dallas, Orlando, Raleigh-Durham, Chicago… ditto. Silicon Valley rose to prominence over decades. A perfectly stirred melting pot of top universities, eager financiers, shared idealism, and a desire to connect with the best and brightest minds in the tech sector led many a young dreamer to pack their bags and head west on a pilgrimage typically reserved for actors moving to Los Angeles, or gamblers hoping to strike it rich in Las Vegas. As the legendary epicenter of tech grew in reputation, so did its success stories. It was Wall Street in the 1980s, save the designer suits and with only a fraction of the cocaine. Over time, increasing amounts of money made in The Valley began to stay there. Financiers opened up shop on Sand Hill Road in the 70s, starting with KPCB and Sequoia Capital in 1972, and paving the way for dozens more in the coming decades. Sand Hill road became home to wealthy entrepreneurs who struck it rich, staying long enough (they hoped) for lightning to strike twice. And it often did. To this day, over 40 percent of domestic venture capital investments happen inside an area just under half the size of Los Angeles county. The Valley has grown from roughly 200,000 people in the 60s to over three million as of 2015. And while some will ultimately migrate elsewhere — citing the housing shortage, the ever-increasing cost of living, or just a desire to move on — their vacancies (and then some) are increasingly filled from all corners of the globe. It’s created a predictable, if difficult roadmap for young entrepreneurs: start with an idea, move west, secure funding, exit via IPO or acquisition, start your own incubator or VC firm. And if you aren’t in Silicon Valley currently, as the cliché goes, you’re probably in “the next Silicon Valley,” even if you don’t yet know it. Except, of course, none of these cities realize — or perhaps willfully ignore — just how far the gap is between them and the epicenter of technology. Nashville, for example, saw its moment in the sun in the 70s. A population increase of over 160 percent faded over the decades, and the city currently grows at about one percent a year. You’ll find similar numbers in other “next” cities, like Columbus, Reno, or Chicago, each growing at a rate of one to two percent a year, and (often) experiencing a double digit boom in the number of tech jobs. Even this, though, is misleading. Tech job growth in many of these locations would have to continue in the double digits for the better part of a decade to match current numbers on the West Coast — and that’s if you assume the region fails to add any tech jobs of its own. Another frequently-mentioned “next” city is New York. According to a 2017 study, the city is home to more than 390,000 tech workers. San Jose, a city in the heart of The Valley with about 12 percent of New York’s population, had about 310,000. A not-at-all scientific search on Indeed shows that Austin, Denver, and Seattle (combined) offer just under the same number of full-time tech jobs found in Palo Alto, a city with a population of just 67,000. And depending on where you draw the boundary — the geographic boundary referencing Santa Clara County, or the metonymical one including the entire Bay Area — the numbers go from stark to unbelievable in a hurry. So, for all the “next” Silicon Valley’s out there, it’s time for a reality check. Seven percent growth in the tech sector? It’s on par with the national average. That Silicon Valley wunderkind coming home to start his own incubator? A great story, but not exactly Sand Hill Road or even Y Combinator. Your coding bootcamp, that handful of funded startups, the newly-opened maker space? Again, more a sign of the times than a prophetic vision of future success. We get it; your city is great. Low cost of living paired with an up-and-coming tech scene begs the comparison to stalwarts who could be on the verge of stagnation, or even decline. But, you’re decades away from being “next.” So, let’s stop with the comparisons. At least for now.","Nestled on the banks of the Cumberland River, Nashville is a gritty, yet often picturesque representation of middle America.

Julie McCarthy,"The Donggala District Prison was torched by rioting prisoners one day after the double earthquake and tsunami disasters on Sept. 28. Donggala is close to the epicenter of the earthquake, and rattled prisoners wanted a way out. Noele Mage/NPR It's not every day you see freed prisoners walk back into the arms of their jailers. But about 80 inmates from Indonesia's Donggala District Prison are doing just that. They assembled this past week on the patchy grass of the prison grounds and counted off for prison head Safiuddin. The diminutive warden's powers of persuasion worked for this group, but not for all of the 360 prisoners who had been serving time in the old jailhouse when an earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia on Sept. 28. Donggala lies close to the epicenter of the earthquake, where the shaking was the most violent. Rattled prisoners rioted to get out. The disasters killed more than 2,000 people across the country. Thousands more are believe to be missing, and the government says it will halt its search for any more victims starting Thursday. The true death toll may never be known. Warden Safiuddin says that as tensions escalated inside the prison, he pleaded for patience but was met by a ""band of inmates"" who ""could not be controlled."" First, one cellblock was torched. Then prisoners set fire to the football field out back. After that, they returned to the prison again to burn another cellblock. ""Some were wearing ninja masks and shouting to attack the prison officers,"" Safiuddin says. The inmates devolved into ""anarchy,"" he adds. He decided to throw open the doors and let them out, rather than risk ""all sorts of casualties."" ""It was a tough decision,"" Safiuddin says one he made out of concern for the safety of his officers whose lives were under threat. Safiuddin acknowledges the escapees were animated mostly out of worry for their families, and rumors. Word had spread that inmates at other prisons had already been released to check on their loved ones. On Sept. 30, the day after the fire, Safiuddin addressed an emotional gathering of about 260 prisoners who had stayed. ""I cried, the prisoners cried,"" he recalls. He excoriated them, saying, ""We are all in trouble now."" The rioting and burning had made the prison uninhabitable. He told them they were all free to go and visit their families, on the condition they come back and regularly report on their status. About a quarter of the prisoners check back every other day, as they await assignment to another prison. On this day, Safiuddin asks these self-reporting inmates, ""Are you ready to be transferred?"" The inmates shout back: ""Ready!"" The warden is part preacher, part tough-love coach. ""Encourage your fellow inmates to turn themselves in,"" he says. ""Serve your sentence, and live out your life without worry,"" he exhorts. The Donggala High Court Judge is on hand with a sterner message to the inmates: ""Don't think if you run, you can hide,"" he warns. Donggala is a medium-security prison. There are no murderers or rapists. In fact, there are no felons at all. These morning assemblies are studies in casualness, with prison guards standing around swapping cigarettes with the returning inmates who have been convicted of minor offenses. Small-time corruption is a common one. Mohammad Taris, 49, was convicted of corruption. As a village chieftain, he falsified receipts for item such as chairs and kindergarten toys, but now says he's determined to ""obey the law, and with a clear conscience and without pressure from anyone."" He plans to report back to the prison even though he's free. Noele Mage/NPR Mohammad Taris, a stocky 49-year-old with a quick smile, was the village chief when he falsified receipts for things such as ""chairs and kindergarten toys."" Mohammad says he has checked in with his grown sons, and is determined to serve out the remaining seven months of his sentence. Given the chance for freedom, most people would take it and never look back. Not Mohammad. ""I want to obey the law. Obey the law,"" he repeats for effect. ""With a clear conscience, and without pressure from anyone, I will report here."" Prisoner Arifudin, 49, said he dutifully reports back in because ""it was better to fully serve"" his sentence. He has one month left on his prison sentence for underage marriage. A female self-reporting prisoner, Lili Setioningsih, was convicted of stealing from the school where she worked. The 37-year old mother says that a sea of mud carried her house away in the district of Sigi. Her children have been moved to her parents' home, far away. She's appealed to the warden to ease her ""trauma."" She wants him to ""find a prison where I can serve out my time closer to my children. It's all up to him,"" she says. The warden, who is listening to our conversation, leans in and quietly assures her: ""It will be done."" Perhaps a fresh start in the making, from the ruins of Indonesia's twin disasters.","Prisoners at the Donggala District Prison rioted as the earthquake and tsunami hit last month.

Matthew Hughes,"Earlier today, Le Journal de Montreal reported that the Quebecois government will lift its ban on the sale of electricity to cryptocurrency miners, which has been in place since March, 2018. Instead, Quebec is looking for a more measured relationship with the mining companies that have fled to Canada’s second-most populous province in search of cheap electricity. Quebec is blessed with a supply of low-cost electricity, thanks to Hydro-Québec’s network of 63 hydroelectric power stations. This (and the crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in China ) has attracted a steady flow of would-be bitcoin miners. Unfortunately, the demand for electricity wasn’t sustainable. Earlier this month, a Hydro-Québec spokesperson told the CBC that the cryptomining scene was using around a quarter of its capacity. In order to protect other homes and businesses on the network, Hydro-Québec suspended all new applications from cryptominers, as well as additional requests for power. The new regulation lifts this moratorium, and instead seeks to work with these companies. Cryptominers will get their electricity, but there’s a small caveat. During peak times, Hydro-Québec is permitted to do “forced load shedding.” This means it’ll cut off power during the 100 to 300 hours a per year when the Quebec power grid is stretched to capacity. This deal makes sense for a couple of reasons. Firstly, cryptomining is good for the economy. If a new data center opens, it creates jobs — not just for those who operate it, but also for those who build it. By playing nice with miners, Quebec has positioned itself as the epicenter of this brand new industry, right at the beginning. But it has ensured that this doesn’t come at the expense of homes and other businesses. But also, Quebec produces more electricity than it can reasonably use. The province is a bit of an oddity, insofar as it’s a net exporter of electricity. It, for example, provides New England with a huge chunk of its electricity needs. Doesn’t it make more sense for that electricity to be used on economic activity within Québec? And finally, there’s a big environmental plus. Quebec’s power generation is almost entirely based on renewable sources of energy. Given the choice, I’d rather see bitcoin come from clean, emissions-free energy. Wouldn’t you?

Patrick Howell O'Neill,"The Americans hack the Russians, the Russians hack the Americans, this is the song that never ends. But what comes next on our merry-go-round?
On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that U.S. Cyber Command hacked and shut down the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) during the U.S. midterm elections in November. The IRA is that notorious troll factory U.S. officials say is dedicated to supporting Russias global geopolitical goals with online information warfare.
You might remember the IRA from previous indictments such as Robert Mullers 2018 prosecution against 13 Russian individuals and three companies allegedly involved in a plot to interfere with the 2016 U.S. elections.
Now that the 2020 campaign cycle has started, the best way to understand last years U.S. attack against the IRA is to look at the United States shifting its strategy and rules in cyberspace: That means its now easier for the U.S. military to engage in offensive hacking that sends a message.
Rob Joyce, a senior cybersecurity advisor at the National Security Agency and previously the White House cybersecurity coordinator, underlined the policy in an interview on Thursday with CyberScoop about the Trump administration opening the door to more offensive cyber operations by the U.S. military.
We have to impose costs in a visible way to start deterrence, Joyce said. We have to go out and try to make those operations less successful and harder to do.
In the language of politicians and spies, deterrence is an action designed to discourage. In this case, the new rules are meant to discourage attacks against the United Stateslike, for instance, the interference in the 2016 election.
But beyond the basics, the story leaves a Mt. Everest worth of questions. The Post articlewhich is based on leaks from several unnamed U.S. officialsincludes cheerleading from Senator Mike Rounds who credits U.S. Cyber Commands attack with preventing serious cyber-incursions.
That doesnt make a lot of sense on its face, given that the IRA carries out information warfare rather than actual hacking resulting in intrusions. At this point, its impossible, by design, for the public to decipher what the latest American actions actually meannot to mention how Moscow might ultimately react.
In the short term, Russia has responded in a variety of telling ways.
Russias Federal News Agency (FAN), made globally famous in a 2015 New York Times exposé about its army of troll propagandists, seemed to confirm an American offensive and called it unproductive and unprofessional.
Asked about the U.S.-claimed attack, a prominent Kremlin spokesman said cyberattacks are constantly carried out from U.S. territory against various Russian organizations. The spokesperson didnt confirm or deny the attack, but he did argue in general that U.S. attacks against Russia justified Moscows tests of disconnecting its internet from the world as part of a sovereign internet plan.
FAN is not a particularly famous name inside the United States. Government-owned outlets like Sputnik and TASS get more exposure while the IRA is seen as an epicenter of Russian information warfare.
Think of FAN as a little brother. The organization has operated in the same building as the IRA, raising questions about the relationship between the two organizations that may just be different bureaus of the same operation. The New York Times has reported that the two are intimately connected. FAN publishes and pushes what can only be described as transparent pro-Kremlin trolling desperate to get coverage inside the United States.
FANs history includes sensationalist and homophobic complaints about the FBI recognizing LGBTQ employees, offices with pictures of President Donald Trump next to the Confederate flag, and frankly bizarre attempts to organize rallies at the White House.
In other words, theyre trolls eager to provoke a reaction, and there is little or no effort to hide it.
The Post article notes that the IRA was denied internet access on the day of the 2018 midterms but, when it comes to influence operations, its the preceding months and years that matter most. Still, its hard to beat the optics of hacking an enemy on Election Day, and the recently revealed back and forth is genuinely something weve never seen beforeeven if no one outside of U.S. Cyber Commands Ft. Meade headquarters really understands what it all means yet.
I believe that signals indicating one country making a cyber operation against targets at another country, together with the subsequent signals coming from sources in another country confirming such operations would be an unprecedented event in the history of cyber conflicts, Dr. Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher and advisor, and research associate at Center for Technology and Global Affairs of Oxford University, told Gizmodo via email.
In addition to delivering messages to adversaries in Moscow, the U.S. intelligence community is intent on delivering one to the American public. NSAs Joyce, in his recent interview, touted how well his colleagues had handled 2018 and signaled more to come in the lead up to 2020.
Were pretty proud of delivering a midterm election that was free of malfeasance and interference, and were already working pretty hard on the 2020 [election], the NSAs Joyce told CyberScoop, emphasizing the NSAs partnership with agencies including U.S. Cyber Command and the FBI. [W]eve said the time has come that we have to alter the field and not just stand back and wait for opponents to probe us.","The Americans hack the Russians, the Russians hack the Americans, this is the song that never ends.

Ed Cara,"If using the law to corral antivaxxers doesnt work at first, try, try again. At least, that seems to be the lesson learned by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. On Tuesday, he declared a state of emergency and mandated residents of the Williamsburg neighborhood, where an outbreak of measles has been raging since last fall, get vaccinated for the viral disease. Those who choose not to will risk the penalty of a $1,000 fine.
The declaration is the second made by a local government in New York State in response to the outbreak, following one issued by officials in nearby Rockland County this March. That declaration came with a decree that minors could not enter most public spaces in the county so as long they remained unvaccinated, for up to 30 days. But reluctant parents whose children attended a school so far unaffected by measles soon attempted to file an injunction that would lift the ban. Last week, the judge hearing their case agreed with them, stating the number of cases in the countryover 150 confirmed cases currentlydidnt legally merit the need for the countys emergency order.
New York Citys order, officially issued by the citys health commissioner, Oxiris Barbot, takes a different tack than the public ban in Rockland. It will require every unvaccinated person who lives or works within Williamsburg, an area of Brooklyn spread across four zip codes, to get vaccinated for measles through the combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine within the next 48 hours (unless they have proof of already having had the disease or are medically exempt). Parents of unvaccinated children will be held responsible for getting them the shot. The order is set to remain in place until at least April 17, when the next New York City Board of Health meeting is scheduled to be held, though they might decide to extend it further.
This is the epicenter of a measles outbreak that is very, very troubling and must be dealt with immediately, the mayor said at a press conference in Williamsburg announcing the order. At last count, there have been 285 diagnosed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens, primarily among the Orthodox Jewish community.
Though the order applies to anyone living in Williamsburg, health officials will (for now) only reach out to people who might have come into contact with infected individuals and confirm their vaccination history. Those found unvaccinated will then be told to get the shot. Rocklands ban came with the potential threat of six months jail time and/or a $500 fine, since it would be considered a misdemeanor. Under New York City law, violating this order would instead incur a maximum $1,000 fine.
Both outbreaks in the state are thought to have originated from Israel (the disease was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000). Its not the first time a recent measles outbreak has circulated almost entirely among the Orthodox Jewish community in New York. While the religion as a whole does not shun vaccination, certain rabbis do discourage the practice, often having been influenced by anti-vaccination propaganda.
At the conference, Health Commissioner Barbot said they had received reports of measles parties, events where parents intentionally expose their healthy children to a measles-infected person. But the evidence that these parties have ever really existed is shaky and anecdotal at best. On the other hand, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin did recently claim that he exposed all nine of his children to a chickenpox-infected person. Chickenpox is another preventable disease thats starting to bubble back up through outbreaks in the U.S.
What we do know for sure is that while the fast-spreading measles usually causes a mild flu-like illness and distinctive rash, it can sometimes lead to serious neurological problems and even death. These risks are especially heightened among vulnerable populations like the very young who havent received their first MMR shot. Typically, the first of two doses is given at 12 to 15 months of age, though Rockland county officials have recommended that kids as young as six months get vaccinated in affected areas. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are no less than seven ongoing outbreaks of measles, spread across five states, in the U.S. right now. And the current tally of cases (465 and climbing) is already the second largest number of cases reported in a year since the disease was formally wiped out in 2000.","If using the law to corral antivaxxers doesn’t work at first, try, try again.

Alex Morrell,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch has had a rough year in investment banking, as revenues have declined and group head Christian Meissner announced his departure in September. But the company believes they've diagnosed the problem and are on their way to correcting it. The solution, according to CEO Brian Moynihan: adding bankers to win back middle-market mergers-and-acquisitions revenues in the US, an area the bank overlooked and lost market share in. Speaking at a financial conference on Tuesday, Moynihan said his firm is ""adding some capacity"" to go after the higher end of middle-market investment banking, an area where the bank wasn't claiming as much of the market as he thought it should have. Read more: A wave of senior departures, lost market share, and a 20% drop in fees: A dismal year in investment banking at Bank of America Through the first nine months of 2018, investment banking revenues declined sharply, falling 20% from $2.7 billion to $2.1 billion. That led Moynihan and CFO Paul Donofrio to call out the division on second- and third-quarter earnings calls, saying ""we can do better."" The US market was the epicenter of the pain, particularly in M&amp;A. While the bank crushed the competition in IPOs, it fell to 8th on the league tables in US M&amp;A fees through the first three quarters, down from fourth in 2017, according to Dealogic. That puts them behind smaller competitors like Barclays, Jefferies, and Credit Suisse. Moynihan pinpointed the dwindling market share in the US on mid-size transactions, saying the firm left a gap in its investment banking coverage. ""What we observed I think largely was as we really fine-tuned the quote customer list, coverage list, we may have left a hole in the United States. So we've been feeding back into that hole,"" Moynihan said. While the firm's coverage of the higher end middle-market deals improved elsewhere in the world over the past five to seven years, it fell by the wayside in the US. Moynihan said Matthew Koder, Meissner's replacement as head of the corporate and investment bank, is working on filling out that team to steal back their fair share of deals. ""We've got to come back and take our deserved share out of the US. That's where the opportunity is and they're after it. And we feel good — we're seeing it come through,"" Moynihan said.","Bank of America Merrill Lynch is adding bankers to capture more middle-market deals in the US, CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday.

Back Story Photo Credit Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images On this day in 1961, the 23rd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was approved by the required three-fourths of the states, giving Washingtonians the right to vote for president and vice president for the first time in more than 160 years. “The United States finally gave its capital the vote today,” The Times noted on its front page, with a hint of impatience. The amendment granted representation to the District of Columbia in the Electoral College, where states are given electors based on population. Although the District’s population ( estimated around 700,000 in 2017 ) is larger than that of some states, it is given no more electors than the least populous state, which is currently Wyoming. At the time, the push to give the vote to the district, with its large African-American population, became caught up in the civil rights movement. The amendment was opposed in the South, where Tennessee was the only state to ratify it. Democrats have since been able to count on the district’s three electoral votes, which have been cast for each of the party’s presidential candidates, starting with Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Although the district’s residents have a say at the White House, they lack a full voice in Congress, where their representative does not have full voting rights.

Drawing on satellite image analysis and interviews with Rohingya eyewitnesses, Amnesty said that Rohingya mosques and homes have been bulldozed “at an alarming pace,” and new infrastructure, including roads, helipads, and military bases, are being build in their place. “What we are seeing in Rakhine state is a land grab by the military on a dramatic scale,” Amnesty’s Crisis Response Director Tirana Hassan said in a statement. “New bases are being erected to house the very same security forces that have committed crimes against humanity against Rohingya.” The report follows previous accounts by Amnesty and other rights groups who have documented the demolition of Rohingya villages at the epicenter of recent violence, prompting concerns that evidence of human rights abuses are being concealed before they can be properly documented. “Myanmar’s authorities are erasing evidence of crimes against humanity, making any future attempts to hold those responsible to account extremely difficult,” Hassan said. Since Aug. 25, more than 671,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh, after the military launched a campaign of violence on the Rohingya population that the U.N.’s top human rights official strongly suspects includes “ acts of genocide.” Myanmar’s government, which argues that the operations were a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya militants, has requested “clear evidence” that atrocities have occurred. Read more: Rohingya Refugees: Myanmar’s Crisis Is Bangladesh’s Burden According to Amnesty’s report, satellite images reveal that Myanmar’s military is flattening Rohingya villages and building new security infrastructure, including three military bases. One base is allegedly being built in Inn Din township, where a Reuters special report revealed a massacre of 10 Rohingya men and boys in September by military forces and local Buddhist villagers. The new developments also include a “transit center” intended to house returning Rohingya refugees, that was built on top of a burned-out village, Amnesty said. Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a repatriation agreement in January that would see hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees returned within two years. But rights groups have criticized the deal as “alarmingly premature” and raised concerns that repatriated Rohingya will be detained in interment camps similar to those in the center of the state, where some 120,000 Rohingya have been confined since waves of sectarian violence in 2012. “This makes the voluntary, safe and dignified return of Rohingya refugees an even more distant prospect,” Hassan said. “Not only are their homes gone, but the new construction is entrenching the already dehumanizing discrimination they have faced in Myanmar.”","Amnesty International called the construction a ""land grab on a dramatic scale""",2018-03-12T08:49:09Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Myanmar Is Building Military Bases on Torched Rohingya Villages, Rights Group Says",http://time.com/5195201/myanmar-military-bases-rohingya-amnesty/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-909653162.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1
Agustinus Beo Da Costa,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on Saturday, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach. Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town on Friday, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in news briefing in Jakarta. Hundreds of people were preparing for a beach festival to celebrate Palu’s anniversary. The festival was due to start Friday night. Some people climbed six meter (18 feet) trees to escape the tsunami and survived, Nugroho said. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” with thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, a bridge washed away and the main highway to Palu cut due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency has been widely criticized for not informing a tsunami had hit Palu on Saturday, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu and on Saturday authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts. The disaster mitigation agency has not been able to get any information from the fishing town of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake 27 km (16 miles) away. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid. The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in. Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said no command center for disaster recovery has been created yet. The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

STEFANOS CHEN,"The rental market, which makes up roughly three-fourths of the borough’s housing, peaked in 2014, when units leased for a median $2,936 a month, according to a Douglas Elliman Real Estate report. The median rent has since fallen more than 10 percent, to $2,632 in February, as existing units vied with new competition. To grease the skids, developers have ramped up their marketing, often offering concessions to fill units quickly, said Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser who prepared the report. Developers’ reliance on concessions “is probably the worst-kept secret in the rental market,” said Mr. Miller, who found that 47.5 percent of Brooklyn rentals offered some form of sweetener in February, a record high. In the same period last year, just 15.7 percent had concessions. On average, renters received the equivalent of 1.4 months of free rent, with most of the concessions on one-year leases, Mr. Miller said. The incentives were most common in three of the borough’s most expensive neighborhoods — Dumbo, Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene — each of which offered concessions on more than 80 percent of known leases in January. The analysis doesn’t capture the whole market, Mr. Miller said, because unlike sales, leases are not public record and developers are motivated to keep their numbers close to the vest. “Developers want to maintain their listing prices, and then futz with the numbers behind the scenes,” said Paul Johansen, an associate broker with CORE Real Estate. “A couple years ago, there were no concessions whatsoever.” That hasn’t deterred builders from moving forward with thousands of new units, most of them geared toward the luxury market. In 2017, more than 5,700 rentals hit the market — the most units in a year since 2008, said Nancy Packes, the real estate consultant. And the future pipeline shows no signs of slowing: About 6,100 units are expected this year, followed by almost 9,600 in 2019. Ms. Packes, whose clients include Brooklyn developers, said the surge in supply is cyclic, with the glut clearing out by 2019 or 2020. “They’re looking at the trees, not the forest,” she said about growth skeptics, noting that demand remains strong, fueled by a strong job market and population growth. For renters accustomed to Manhattan prices, Brooklyn can still seem like a relative bargain. After concessions, the median rent price in Manhattan was $3,168 in February, Mr. Miller said; in Brooklyn, it was $2,632. Eileen Norton, 28, who works for IBM’s Watson Health division, is in a two-year lease at the Hub for a one-bedroom apartment, where she lives with her boyfriend Kevin Gallagher, 29, an accountant. The couple effectively pays around $3,350 a month, after calculating the two free months of rent. (Smaller one-beds started at $3,000.) They also received five months of free amenities — including the pool and gym — that typically cost $75 a month, per person. Almost 90 percent of the Hub’s market-rate apartments are studios or one-bedrooms and seem geared toward young professionals, which could explain why the children’s playroom was impeccably clean, and empty, on a recent tour. Photo 325 Kent, a 522-unit rental building in South Williamsburg designed by SHoP Architects. Credit Adrian Gaut In Manhattan, where she lived for five years on the Lower East Side, “I could barely find a one-bed in the same price range, with amenities that could compete,” she said. Her new rental has a washer/dryer, expansive city views and welcome perks, she said: “It’s my first apartment in New York with an actual coat closet, which is amazing.” In spite of high demand for Brooklyn housing, the new supply remains heavily skewed toward luxury apartments. Overall, New York City had a rental vacancy rate of 3.63 percent, which qualifies as a housing shortage, according to the city’s latest Housing and Vacancy Survey. New York has remained below 5 percent rental vacancy since at least World War II, said Moses Gates, the director of community planning and design for Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. But in the luxury segment, apartments priced at $2,500 or more had a vacancy rate of 8.74 percent, which was “at or approaching” a record high, Mr. Gates said. While the full survey, including a breakdown of Brooklyn vacancy rates, will not be released until summer, there already are signs of a shift at the top of the market, he said. “We’re at or close to an inflection point, same as we were in 2007,” he said, referring to the recession, when luxury prices flattened and high-end development stalled. Still, Brooklyn is sprawling, and some developers are testing markets farther afield. In South Williamsburg, the former 11-acre Domino Sugar refinery site includes 325 Kent, where more than half of the 522 units have been leased since last summer. The waterfront development is about a 15-minute walk to the nearest subway; the copper-and-zinc structure with a hollow doughnut core, developed by Two Trees Management and designed by SHoP Architects, has studios for $2,620 up to two-bedrooms starting at $5,520. (A leasing fact sheet on the premises recently offered a reduced rent, based on two months free for a 14-month lease.) Pablo Marvel, 25, a co-founder of Nova Concepts, a real-estate marketing and tech firm that uses drone photography, moved into a studio apartment in the project in September. “I still feel like people think Manhattan is the epicenter of New York, which is simply not true,” he said. While his office is in the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard, he said he uses the building’s waterfront common areas, complete with Ping-Pong and pool tables, as a satellite office. Kate Treen, a spokeswoman for the project, said about 40 percent of residents work from home. To entice renters, the building also offered six to 12 months of free parking, which typically costs $350 a month, and will begin shuttle service to the nearest subways. (L train service will end for more than a year beginning in 2019.) In Red Hook, a neighborhood along the East River that lacks direct subway access, the developer Sanba has built a 22-townhouse complex of four-bedroom homes ranging in price from $2.95 million to $3.41 million. After a year and a half, the development, called King and Sullivan, has three remaining houses for sale, asking more than $1,100 a square foot, a record for the neighborhood, said Mr. Johansen, the CORE agent who is selling there.

Eric Mack,"On March 17, the streets will run green as revelers flood city centers, pubs and just about everywhere else to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. It's a celebration of all things Irish that's rooted more in the Irish diaspora, especially in North America, than on the Emerald Isle itself. For centuries, Boston has been thought of as the epicenter and originator of St. Patrick's Day celebrations, but a new discovery reveals that the holiday was celebrated much earlier on another end of the continent, and in a language not typically associated with St. Paddy's. Recently discovered records from Spain's archives of the American colonies yielded a single curious entry: gunpowder expenditures for shooting off cannons during a 1601 St. Patrick's Day celebration in St. Augustine, Florida. ""It was certainly a surprise,"" said historian J. Michael Francis from the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg, who uncovered the document. ""It did not register the first time I saw the name 'San Patricio,' the Spanish name for St. Patrick. After a few seconds it actually hit me that there was a St. Patrick's Day parade/procession in St. Augustine in 1601. Even more surprising was that the document identified St. Patrick as the patron saint of the city's maize fields."" The spanish celebration of the Irish priest pre-dates the first celebrations in Boston by more than a century. The archives also suggest that they were likely introduced to the colonies in modern day Florida by an Irish priest from Spain named Ricardo Artur. So when you raise your Guinness amongst the verdantly clad throngs to honor good friends, good cheer and St. Patrick himself, don't forget to add Father Ricardo to the list.","Boston has been celebrating St. Paddy's for centuries, but another city started the tradition even earlier, and in a different language.",2018-03-17T15:45:52Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","The Surprising History of St. Patrick's Day Was Just Revealed (Sorry Boston, It Started Somewhere Else)",https://www.inc.com/eric-mack/the-surprising-history-of-st-patricks-day-was-just-revealed-sorry-boston-it-started-somewhere-else.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_147318339_349785.jpg,,Inc.com,epicenter,1

"Lena H. Sun and Kristen Millares Young, The Washington Post","OLYMPIA, Washington - Anti-vaccine activists packed a public hearing Friday to oppose a bill that would make it harder for families to opt out of vaccination requirements for measles, mumps and rubella amid the state's worst measles outbreak in more than two decades.
An estimated 700 people, most of them opposed to stricter requirements, lined up before dawn in the cold, toting strollers and hand-lettered signs, to sit in the hearing, which was so crowded that staff opened up additional rooms to accommodate the crowd. Many gathered outside for a rally afterward.
Anti-vaccine activists, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine conspiracy theorist, claimed that health officials are covering up vaccine dangers. Some said their children had been injured or sickened by immunizations. One falsely said the majority of people diagnosed with measles have been vaccinated.
When Washington Health Secretary John Wiesman debunked those claims, some members of the audience murmured in disapproval.
""I want to remind you that the MMR vaccine is extremely safe and highly effective,"" Wiesman told lawmakers. He said that ""all reputable scientific studies have found no relation between measles and autism,"" before outlining the potential harms of the highly contagious respiratory virus, which can be fatal in small children.
Wiesman urged lawmakers to pass the bill to eliminate personal or philosophical exemptions, noting the current outbreak, which has sickened at least 56 people in Washington and Oregon, is more alarming than the state's three previous ones.
""This one is larger and infecting people faster than in recent history,"" he said. ""In states with tighter exemption laws, there is less suffering, fewer hospitalizations and more deaths averted.""
The bill, which would still allow existing exemptions for medical and religious reasons, is sponsored by Rep. Paul Harris, R-Vancouver, who represents Clark County, the epicenter of the outbreak just north of Portland. He said he expects the bill to reach the House floor by the end of the month. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate.
Harris said chances for passage are better this year than three years ago, when a similar effort failed. He cited overwhelming support for a high level of community immunity to protect children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems who can't get vaccinated. But groups on the extreme ends of the political spectrum are opposed.
""This issue activates both my far right and my far left,"" he said.
The Pacific Northwest is home to some of the nation's most vocal and organized anti-vaccination activists. That movement has helped drive down child immunizations in Washington, as well as in neighboring Oregon and Idaho, to some of the lowest rates in the country, with as many as 10.5 percent of kindergartners statewide in Idaho unvaccinated for measles. That is almost double the median rate nationally.
Most of those infected in the current outbreak are unvaccinated children under age 10, health officials said. The outbreak has prompted a huge increase in the number of people getting vaccinated in Clark County, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The average number of immunizations has gone up from about 200 a week on average, to more than 1,000 during the last two weeks of the month, Wiesman told reporters later.
""The challenge we face is that most people haven't seen this, the effects of an outbreak,"" he said. ""If you travel the world, people will line up for this vaccine, because they have seen it.""
A new report Thursday by the World Health Organization warned of a worldwide surge in measles cases in 2018, with 15 times more measles cases in Europe last year than in 2016. For the first time, the WHO listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global threats of 2019.
Washington is one of 17 states that allow personal or philosophic exemptions to vaccination requirements, meaning virtually anyone can opt out. But outbreaks across the country are prompting lawmakers in several states to weigh tightening immunization requirements. In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown told reporters Thursday the legislature will likely look at ways to strengthen legislation, but didn't offer specifics.
Lawmakers in other states are monitoring what happens in Washington because they are also ""facing an increase in vaccine hesitancy among concerned parents and an increase in advocacy by anti-vax groups,"" said Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
One activist who spoke Friday, Mary Holland, who teaches at New York University law school and said her son has a vaccine-related injury, warned lawmakers that if the bill passes, many vaccine opponents will ""move out of the state, or go underground, but they will not comply.""
That sentiment resonated with Nicole Wilson, 32, who is pregnant and said she has no intention of vaccinating her unborn child. ""Me and my boyfriend were already thinking about it,"" Wilson said about moving out of state. She said her 1-year-old daughter was vaccinated against her wishes.
""I'll tell you something. They are not going to change our minds,"" Wilson said.

News18.com,"New Delhi: Rebel BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha's entry into the Congress has been delayed after tussle over seat sharing intensified between Congress and regional giants in Bihar on Thursday.Veteran Congress leader Ramdeo Rai has reportedly told the top brass that the seat-sharing arrangement was not in the grand old party's favour. He said that RLD and other regional parties should not undermine Congress in coalition politics.
The development comes a day after the Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat, represented by former test cricketer Kirti Azad who recently quit the BJP and joined the Congress, emerged as the new bone of contention in the Mahagathbandhan, with the RJD stating that it wished to field its veteran leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui from the seat. 
 State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha, when approached with queries about the RJD's claim, had said Darbhanga was an ""important seat"", but a final call will be taken by the party's high command. 
The Congress had last won the seat way back in 1980. Elaborating further on the party's dilemma, Congress leader Rishi Mishra - whose grandfather Lalit Narayan Mishra was a minister in Indira Gandhi's cabinet and is said to be the tallest leader in the Mithila region where Darbhanga falls claimed that Maithil Brahmins in the constituency are traditional supporters of his party.""Darbhanga can be called the epicenter of Mithila region and Maithil Brahmins have traditionally been Congress supporters. We must respect their sentiments.
""If a Maithil Brahmin like Kirti Azad does not fight from Darbhanga, what is the point in fielding him from some other region,"" he said.
Mishra's statement came in the wake of unconfirmed reports that the Congress was mooting to give Azad a ticket from Dhanbad in the neighbouring state of Jharkhand, if the RJD remained adamant on Darbhanga.
Kirti Azad's father Bhagwat Jha Azad was a veteran Congress leader, who served as as the chief minister of the state for a brief but eventful tenure in the 1980s.
Interestingly, former Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni - whose six-month-old Vikassheel Insaan Party has been allocated three seats within the Grand Alliance - was also said to have been initially keen on Darbhanga, which has a sizeable Nishad population.
Commenting on the developments, Azad said he was hopeful of being fielded from Darbhanga, which has traditionally been a Congress seat. I have been a sportsperson and when I see the wickets in front of me, I always aim at them. However, I am unable to see the wickets in politics right now, he said.","Shatrughan Sinha's Entry Delayed as Congress, RJD Spar Over Seat-sharing Formula News18 Veteran Congress leader Ramdeo Rai has reportedly told the top brass that the seat-sharing arrangement was not in favour of the grand old party and also...

Megan Johnson,"It's perhaps the most Instagram-drenched event in the world: The Coachella Music and Arts Festival, which takes place this weekend in Indio, California, is the epicenter of festival style. And while most concert goers will be focused on everyone from Lorde to DJ Khaled taking the stage, it turns out that the the iconic event will influence a whole lot more than the flower crown industry. It could affect real estate, too. According to data recently released by Homelight, Palm Springs homeowners who list their home in April will sell their property for more than 11% above the yearly average. The long and narrow Coachella Valley, which includes the towns of Indio, Palm Springs, Coachella and more, is synonymous with midcentury design, sun-drenched deserts, and Old Hollywood. Palm Springs has long been an iconic destination, ever since the days when Hollywood studios basically owned their actors, and wouldn't allow them to be more than two hours away from the studios. ""Different hotels and spas and resorts started popping up where the hollywood elite would go away,"" says Byron Lohman, a real estate sales agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices CA Properties. ""Palm Springs started to bloom and grow because of Marilyn Monroe and Frank Sinatra and everyone that was coming out to get away from LA."" In the present day, April music festivals like Coachella and Stagecoach are the biggest events that draw tourists into the Coachella Valley- and many of them end up staying. Since it generally takes about four months to close on a home in Palm Springs, homes that are listed in April and close in July will sell for more than 11% above the yearly average, according to Homelight. ""What we find as agents is that when people come in… they are really event focused. But they get exposed to the environment, the beauty, the culture, the brand,"" says Lohman. ""That's what the people do. They come for these events, they get exposed. They don't buy when they're there, but they call you the next week."" Lohan says the typical buyers are either young people, or those in their middle 40's and 50's that are looking to get away from Los Angeles, San Diego, or San Francisco and find homes to vacation rent out until they're ready to retire.

ejohnson@politico.com (Eliana Johnson),"While Brett Kavanaughs Yale pedigree was a key reason President Donald Trump tapped him for the Supreme Court, his years as an undergraduate there have become a source of heated controversy. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images When Yale Law School put out a press release this summer congratulating Brett Kavanaugh, class of 1990, on his nomination to the Supreme Court, hundreds of students and alumnae expressed outrage. In an open letter, they blasted the institution for praising Kavanaughs professionalism and service to the law school while overlooking what they described as the true stakes of his nomination. Story Continued Below Is there nothing more important to Yale Law School than its proximity to power and prestige? they wrote, describing Kavanaughs nomination as an emergency and a threat to democratic life. The law school, among the nations most prestigious, had issued similar pro-forma statements congratulating other prominent alumni on their accomplishments, including Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor when she was nominated to the high court by President Barack Obama in 2009. But the protest elicited by the anodyne statement about Kavanaughs nomination was a preview of what was to come. In recent weeks, a school long known as a breeding ground for activists has emerged as the epicenter of the Kavanaugh resistance. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Yales role in the Kavanaugh story goes all the way back to 1982, when the law school hosted a three-day symposium that gave birth to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization that has been influential in shifting the countrys judiciary to the right. It was the Federalist Society, which boasts ties to four of the nine Supreme Court justices, who put gave President Trump the list of potential nominees from which Kavanaugh was selected. A resulting irony is that, while Kavanaughs Yale pedigree was a key reason Trump tapped him for the high court, his years as an undergraduate there have become a source of heated controversy including allegations of sexual misconduct by a fellow student, Deborah Ramirez and the current student body at the law school, which is more attuned to politics, a locus of major protest against his nomination. ""What gives it a special turn of the screw is that hes a double Yalie and that so much of the attention has turned to Yale itself with the Deborah Ramirez allegations, said Akhil Amar, a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School. Amar, who penned a New York Times op-ed in support of Kavanaughs nomination shortly after it was announced, has since called for an investigation of the sexual assault claims against the judge. Allegations that another Yale Law School professor and Kavanaugh friend, Amy Chua, who ran Yale Law Schools clerkship program for several years and recommended several clerks to Kavanaugh from that post, told students the judge preferred attractive clerks and advised women to dress in an outgoing manner for their interviews with him have poured gasoline on the fire, said Amar. He defended Chua from accusations that he argues stemmed from the immaturity and oversensitivity of some law school students. You go to law school and this is the transition from carefree college days to the real world of work and youre blaming the law school for the unfairness of the real world. Chua, best known for her 2011 book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, has categorically denied the allegations against her. Law School Dean Heather Gerken in a memo told faculty members and students that the school is investigating allegations of faculty misconduct raised by recent news reports. After the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer graduates of Yale Law School and Yale College, respectively published Ramirezs account on Sunday, dozens of law students contacted their professors demanding that they cancel classes on Monday in order to allow them to protest Kavanaughs nomination. Several complied. This is what faculty support for, and solidarity with, student organizing looks like, law student Dana Bolger wrote on Twitter, tagging James Forman Jr., a professor of criminal law and criminal procedure. She included in her tweet a screenshot of an email Forman sent to the class. I just received a request to cancel class on Monday, Forman wrote. I understand that some students want to go to D.C. to protest or otherwise engage with the Kavanaugh hearings. Criminal Law will be canceled. Forman did not respond to a request for comment. Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science, declined to cancel his classes, telling students in an email shared with POLITICO that he makes a sharp distinction between his own progressive political activities and his role as a university professor engaged in encouraging all my students, regardless of their politics, to engage in free-ranging academic discussion and research. The idea that there should be an organized effort to close down classes is something that I very deeply oppose, and that was what they were trying to do, and some very substantial number of the faculty did indeed close down class, Ackerman said in an interview, though he added that he has been impressed thus far by the tone and tenor of conversation on campus. More than 100 students traveled to Washington in recent days, descending on the Senate and the Supreme Court to register their complaints. On campus, more than 260 Yale Law School students nearly 40 percent of the student body participated in a sit-in on Monday, according to the New Haven Register. They covered the walls of the school, as well and the buildings exterior, with signs have reading #StopKavanaugh, #IStillBelieveAnitaHill, and YLS is a model of complicity. Students are furious. For far too long, YLS has played a key role in funneling abusive, exploitative men into ever greater positions of power, Bolger said in an email. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a 1973 graduate of the law school and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, rallied the protesters Monday evening, praising the courage and strength of Kavanaughs female accusers. They have stepped forward knowing that they faced a nightmare of public shame, false accusations and even threats to their safety, Blumenthal said. He called on Sen. Chuck Grassley to put the brakes on the nomination and called for an independent investigation into the allegations. There are students very upset about the very serious and credible allegations that have been made. And some are deeply unhappy about views, both legal and jurisprudential, Blumenthal told POLITICO on Wednesday. The campus outrage hasnt been limited to students. Before the second and third allegations against Kavanaugh emerged, 40 percent of the law school faculty, including two former deans, signed an open letter demanding a full investigation into the allegation leveled by Christine Blasey Ford. With so much at stake for the Supreme Court and the nation, we are concerned about a rush to judgment that threatens both the integrity of the process and the publics confidence in the Court, the letter said. Some questions are so fundamental to judicial integrity that the Senate cannot rush past them without undermining the publics confidence in the Court. This is particularly so for an appointment that will yield a deciding vote on womens rights and myriad other questions of immense consequence in American lives. Even professors who initially praised Kavanaughs nomination have since backed off. In a Yale Daily News op-ed published Monday titled ""Second Thoughts on Kavanaugh,"" Amar wrote, I believe that these accusations deserve the best and most professional investigation possible even if that means a brief additional delay on the ultimate vote on Judge Kavanaugh, and even if that investigatory delay imperils his confirmation. In an interview, Amar told POLITICO he spent half of his Constitutional Law class this week taking questions from students about his position on the Kavanaugh nomination. The many connections to the university has only intensified interest on the grounds. The story has taken a very decidedly Yale-ish turn, he said.

Jason Parham,"Summer is a time of intense polarities, of feverish abandon and earned languor. There’s heat and purpose waiting to be seized in those unexpected, life-altering summer nights: on the dancefloor, at the bar, among friends. There’s equal chill, though, in the loss and grief that surface: historically, fatalities spike during hotter months. Yet summer, at its glowing core, is a time of auspicious breakthroughs, and the best albums released across June, July, and August rattled with justifiable discovery. Excavating personal triumphs and public traumas, kindling love and sexuality, contending with struggle both emotional and economic. Discovering, ultimately, what it means, to shape yourself. This year has been an especially promising moment in music, a reminder that the gold rush of creativity from artists as varied as Sunflower Bean, Nipsey Hussle, Young Fathers and others won’t soon let up. It’s also a year marked by pure volatility. Artists no longer hew to industry conventions; fall no longer heralds the most attention-commanding records. Pop giants like Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Kanye West all issued albums this summer. Drake and Cardi B were the two most-streamed artists on Spotify, with nearly 1 billion spins between them. And the ascendant California artist Doja Cat released the summer’s surprise viral hit, with “Mooo!” ; amassing more than 10 million views on YouTube since dropping just three weeks ago (she later came under fire after defending past homophobic language in a tweet). And in such transformative times, these six albums are perhaps the truest anomalies marking an era of Peak Music. The Internet, Hive Mind Steve Lacy is one of this generation’s most adept experimentalists—his SoundCloud-released teen-rock psalm “4Real” was one of 2017’s more gutsy propositions—and his work on The Internet’s fourth full-length, Hive Mind, is infused with the same daredevil spirit. Alongside prodigious frontwoman Syd and producer Matt Martians, Lacy helps the R&amp;B collective innovate on the static, laid-back funk they’ve made their signature sound by simplifying their form into an even more cohesive symphony of earnest soul. The album doesn’t squirm as much as its predecessor, the Grammy-nominated Ego Death, but that’s actually a treat: track by track, the melodies coalesce into a groovy sum. “Come Over” is a lurching, bass-heavy slow burner about a cat-and-mouse game of love, while “Next Time/Humble Pie” and “It Gets Better (With Time)” writhe with subdued righteousness (they’re perhaps the two standout tracks on an otherwise standout album). Today, a smattering of on-the-rise artists, particularly on SoundCloud, have built an aesthetic on fragmentation—piecing together dark disparate sounds, doing away with neat genre formulations—but The Internet are proof that reinvention need not be predicated on novelty or risk, but can simply be a matter of honing what you do best. Ariana Grande, Sweetener Last May at Manchester Arena in England, 22 people were killed when a terrorist detonated a bomb during an Ariana Grande concert. The singer’s just-released fourth album blossoms, resilient and rising, from the horror of that day. With production from Pharrell and longtime collaborator Max Martin, and guest features from Missy Elliott and Nicki Minaj, Grande soars, fashioning an album heavy on uplift and love. “When life deals us cards, makes everything taste like it is salt,” she sings on the title track. “Then you come through like the sweetener you are to bring the bitter taste to a halt.” A meld of plinking keys, dense synths, and candied hooks, the album derails where her three previous kept right on track: it’s still decidedly empowerment pop, but it feels less manufactured for radio play thanks to Pharrell’s spaced-out ruses (particularly on “Borderline” and “R.E.M.”) and the somber, passion-sick “Better Off.” Grande fittingly bookends the album with eulogies to the Manchester victims, and in doing so, delivers her most vulnerable record to date. Buddy, Harlan &amp; Alondra There’s a boom happening out west. California is quickly developing some of music’s most promising young talent. Los Angeles’ Top Dawg Entertainment alone has a chokehold on the charts thanks to Kendrick Lamar’s triumphant reign with DAMN. —which won him a Pulitzer Prize; the first for a rapper—the Black Panther soundtrack, and Jay Rock’s unrepentant Redemption. There’s also the aforementioned soul-collective The Internet and gangsta rap traditionalist Nipsey Hussle, whose album Victory Lap is easily one of 2018’s best. Add the bang and boogie of YG (LA), Mozzy (Sacramento), Kamaiyah (Oakland), SOB x RBE (Vallejo), and Nef the Pharaoh (also Vallejo) with the R&amp;B brilliance of Miguel and Ty Dolla Sign and you’ve got a new age renaissance on your hands. Then there’s quasi-newcomer Buddy, the 24-year-old Compton emcee whose debut, Harlan &amp; Alondra, bumps, shakes, bounces with regional pride. With unapologetic zeal, Buddy pays homage to black LA, past and present, through a stew of g-funk, soul, and breezy rap hymns (“Find Me 2” and “Shine” carry the force and grace of gospel songs). The album’s most politically charged paean, the ASAP Ferg-featuring “Black,” summons the ghost of Trayvon Martin and the Black Panther Party into a message of true urgency. “Just another black man trying to stay out the casket,” he raps. But it’s the album’s insistence on locality—its title is a homage to the two streets Buddy lived on for a time—that is paramount to its success. In doing so, the young rapper is attempting to reorient our gaze, from down South, the unofficial epicenter of hip-hop, back west, where the genre’s being injected with new life. Jorja Smith, Lost &amp; Found London export Jorja Smith first came to international renown via More Life, Drake’s 2017 project of diasporic synthesis. But, really, the 21-year-old R&amp;B prodigy is much more than the two features she was allotted on the rapper’s wobbly experiment. Smith is a true descendant of Amy Winehouse, with the swagger of Miseducation -era Lauryn Hill, and her cauldron of deep soul on Lost &amp; Found, the singer’s beyond sensational debut, is obvious and expansive. Across 12 tracks, Smith swings her powerful, satiny falsetto like a hammer. The thematic landscape she traverses is just as impressive, spanning heartbreak (“Tomorrow”), state-enacted persecution (“Blue Lights”), juvenile abandon (“Teenage Fantasy”), and self-worth (“On Our Own”). For an album of such calculated beauty, Smith never once oversteps her boundaries, coloring within them with the radiant gloss and confidence of contemporaries like Rihanna, H.E.R., and SZA. Blood Orange, Negro Swan The polydirectional artist Dev Hynes—he’s a singer, multi-instrumentalist, director, and producer—understands the gravity of now better than most. The burden of the moment, if you’re black or queer or a woman or poor or any other identifier that white supremacy needs to smash out for its own survival, is a constant one. Hynes, working under the title Blood Orange, has faced these worries and injustices all his life, growing up in East London, and being exposed to them as a black queer person who moves through a world that does not always understand his body, his intention, or his work. The work on Negro Swan, though, continues Hynes’s career-long expedition into the communities that have built him, and cushion him. The album’s skeletal core deals with how one manages trauma, and one of its smarter plays is to cocoon songs with audio from author, TV writer, and activist Janet Mock, who speaks in short bursts about family, the power of images, and the importance of “showing up.” One early track, “Jewelry,” finds Mock flipping an insult—telling someone they are “doing the most”—on its head, asking: “But why would we want to do the least?” Negro Swan is Hynes’ sixth album, his fourth as Blood Orange, and it unfolds as mostly minimalist, downtempo fare. It’s a quiet, curious thing that answers as many questions as it asks. It’s a record about healing and getting through the day, about hope and defeat and trying to figure it out even when you don’t know where to begin. In this sense, it may end up being the year’s most vital, even if most don’t realize it yet. Nicki Minaj, Queen Breakthrough and reinvention are what Nicki Minaj has aimed for steadily throughout her career. And while the summer’s top albums are linked by the very same pursuits, perhaps with conflicting results, Minaj’s is perhaps the most stark—and the most surprising for where it ended up. For years, despite being one the most gifted rappers in the game, she was considered second-rate by some (mostly male) veterans. Still, the awards, the nominations, and the praise flooded in. The Barbz, her faithful online fanbase, held her down, often to the scorn of public approval. And Minaj’s stature grew; she became a solar system unto herself—a certified hitmaker, a trusted collaborator, and an unforgiving shit-stirrer. Queen, her fourth studio album, reckons with all of this. Which is to say, it’s an album about the drama of being, and what that brings with it. Of all the albums on this list, Queen is the least impressive—though “Barbie Dreams,” “LLC,” and lead single “Chun-Li” are soaked with characteristic Nicki wit—but, it’s what the album symbolizes in the abstract that lends it extra weight. Both the lead-up to its release and its fallout were sullied by social media theatrics and a shady promo run. The occurrences helped to expose another side of the star: she didn’t just play the role of villain anymore, she was the villain. What, then, does it mean to use your identity as an instrument of persuasion, for harm or actual good or even your own means? It’s a question that requires tough truths. The pursuit of breakthrough is not a guarantee, either. Much of the harsh criticism that surrounds Queen is born of our own failed expectations for Minaj, and how we hoped she would mature creatively. But Queen, as a whole, represents Minaj’s evolution into who she wants to be—someone who, whether we approve of it or not, does things just as she sees fit.

Daniel Brown and Michelle Mark,"Border Patrol agents spoke to Business Insider about their patrols in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for migrants and drug smugglers along the southern border. Business Insider/Daniel Brown MCALLEN, TEXAS — Every day, Border Patrol agent Chris Seiler says he hears astonishing stories of hardship from the people he arrests crossing the US-Mexico border. ""It's part of the job,"" he said. Border Patrol agents brought Business Insider on a six-hour ride-along on Monday in the heart of Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings along the entire US-Mexico border. It was a quiet shift with no arrests, but the agents emphasized they usually have multiple encounters with migrants, smugglers, or both. The Rio Grande Valley has the highest number of Border Patrol arrests along the entire US-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2017, the area accounted for a whopping 45% of all Border Patrol apprehensions. Many of the migrants who cross the border in the valley have been traveling through Mexico for days or weeks, and have endured horrific conditions. Seiler, the special agent in charge of the Rio Grande Valley Sector's special operations detachment, ticked off a list of common stories he's heard. ""Non-potable water, zero to no food, sexual abuse, raping, robbing, pillaging,"" he said, adding that the smugglers who guide the migrants have little concern for their welfare. ""Anything [smugglers] want to do, they can."" Seiler said he feels bad for many of the victims he encounters — especially those who have been raped or abused — but they have to arrest the migrants regardless. And since most of the crimes they hear of take place back in Mexico, there's little they can do to find the perpetrators. ""You see these people come across, and they live very tough lives,"" he said. ""But our job, the execution of our duties, is to keep you safe."" Border Patrol agents take a boat down the Rio Grande River in McAllen, Texas. Business Insider/Daniel Brown Seiler said agents do take note of any information they can regarding crimes against migrants, and they pass it to their counterparts in Mexico. But it's often a dead end. Further complicating the investigations is the fact that many of the victims have little to no details to offer about their assailants. They often report vague descriptions like ""a 28-year-old Hispanic"" who may have attacked while the migrants were being held in ""a house south of the border."" ""That's the information I have, and we have no jurisdiction over there,"" he said. ""You can't report it — the guy's a ghost."" The sector that Seiler and his colleagues patrol has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, as the epicenter of the Trump administration's border crackdown. President Donald Trump's recently halted ""zero tolerance"" policy culminated in the separation of thousands of migrant families, most of whom still haven't been reunited. Seiler said he's well aware of the media attention being focused on the migrants — but he wants Americans to understand what Border Patrol agents face, too. He said many agents are affected by the stories they hear and the things they witness — especially the dead bodies they pull out of the Rio Grande River to identify. ""They talk a lot about the aliens and the things the aliens go through every day,"" he said, referring to unauthorized immigrants. ""But the piece they're missing is everything the agents go through.""

""When you get the interview, do your homework and research the company. Look at their website, Instagram account, blog, Facebook and Twitter."" It seems obvious, but for Nader it bears repeating. ""Make sure when you're going for that dream job, your appearance is on-brand,"" he adds. ""You'll win major bonus points walking into the interview, looking like you know what the company's image is."" Last, but not least, attitude and work ethic count. ""Don't be a clock-watcher,"" he advises. ""The manager sees everything. [Stay] that extra 30 minutes if you have to; it's not going to kill you. There are always more potentials that want the job you've got.""

Does the word over-achiever come to mind? Wait, she's created her own brand of fake eyelashes, too. So if it didn't initially, we're betting it does now.

ROBERTA SMITH,"It was a demanding process, which Mr. Rollins oversaw from beginning to end. The authors he selected were challenging and included Shakespeare, Daniel Defoe, Lewis Carroll and Malcolm X. Digesting their writings could take weeks, and arriving at a a suitable motif, a process they called jammin’, could take months. Some books were put aside for years and returned to later. The individual variations that the students made had to pass muster with the group as a whole before being added to the large paper-covered canvases. Their first series remained their best known: densely wrought compositions of convoluted golden horns whose intricacies could evoke lattices, weapons or bodies. They were inspired by the trumpets played by angels in the final chapter of Franz Kafka’s “Amerika.” Equally distinctive, and almost as popular with museums, were the gold-trimmed red capital A’s inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter.” The group covered pages of “The Red Badge of Courage” with widely spaced images of wounds, and of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” with densely arranged petal-like blurs of color. For George Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” they painted farm animals with the heads of world leaders. Their texts often had contemporary relevance: Their interpretation of Gustave Flaubert’s “The Temptation of Saint Anthony,” for example, with red-soaked suggestions of diseased cells, resonated with the AIDS crisis. Their work was part of the widespread experimentation in the 1980s in combining form and narrative, usually using aspects of Conceptual and Minimal art. The alluring grid and hazy textures of the book-page surfaces paralleled the painting-collages of painters like Philip Taaffe, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Julian Schnabel. And the collective structure of the group presaged the growing interest in combining art and social activism. Timothy William Rollins, a loquacious man whose speech sometimes assumed the evangelical cadences of the preachers he listened to while growing up in Maine, and later in Harlem, was born on June 10, 1955, in Pittsfield, Me. He was the oldest of four children of Carlton Rollins, who worked in shoe and furniture factories, and the former Charlotte Imogen Hussey, a hospital ward clerk. Photo Mr. Rollins at the FLAG Art Foundation in Manhattan in 2016. Credit FLAG Art Foundation Mr. Rollins, who once said he considered himself “a city kid in a country body,” drew and read voraciously as a child. (Emerson, Thoreau and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were heroes.) With money from part-time jobs, he amassed a comic-book collection that he would sell to attend art school in New York. TimRollins part1 Video by GrDrtube In 1973, Mr. Rollins entered a new art program at the University of Maine at Augusta, where he read everything he could find about the New York art world, including an essay by the prominent Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth, who was teaching at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. In 1975, after Mr. Rollins earned an associate’s degree in art, his application to that school was accepted, and he moved to New York. In short order he was studying with Mr. Kosuth, who was then at the height of his Marxist fervor and teaching the merits of collective politicized action. He was also working as Mr. Kosuth’s assistant, a job he called “my real education.” In 1979, Mr. Rollins and Julie Ault, a classmate from the University of Maine, along with Marybeth Nelson, Patrick Brennan and Beth Jaker, founded Group Material, which operated a small gallery in the East Village. He also studied art education at New York University. Mr. Rollins and his students started exhibiting in 1981 in Group Material’s gallery, initially identifying themselves as “Tim Rollins and 15 Kids From the South Bronx.” (The number would vary.) The students chose the name Kids of Survival in 1982 as invitations to exhibit began to increase. In 1985, the cohort unveiled the first “Amerika” painting in a group show at the Gladstone Gallery in SoHo. Grace Glueck, writing in The New York Times, called it the “coup” of the exhibition. In 1985 and 1986, the group had solo shows at Hostos Community College and Fashion Moda in the Bronx and at Jay Gorney Modern Art, which was then in the East Village. Within a few short years, Tim Rollins + K.O.S. exhibited in the Venice Biennale, at Documenta 8 in Kassel, Germany, and at two Whitney Biennials. The “Amerika” paintings had their own show at the Dia Art Foundation in Chelsea. In 1984, Mr. Rollins received grants to establish the Art and Knowledge workshop, an after-school project in a community center near I.S. 52, with students from other schools sometimes participating; attendance was predicated on maintaining a C average. Photo “The Scarlet Letter: The Procession” was inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel. Credit Studio K.O.S. and Lehmann Maupin He gave up his teaching job in 1987, and the group moved to its first rented studio in 1989. A documentary, “Kids of Survival: The Art and Life of Tim Rollins + K.O.S.,” directed by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, was released in 1996 and won an Emmy. In later years the group consisted of six longtime members: Mr. Abreu, his brother Jorge, Robert Branch, Ala Ebtekar, Ricardo Nelson Savinon and Benjamin Volta. They conducted workshops in schools across the country and around the world, with Mr. Rollins, collaborating with students to make paintings for exhibitions in local museums. Mr. Rollins and K.O.S. were not without controversy. Some people in the art world accused him of being a white interloper using Hispanic and African-American youths as a publicity vehicle. When they left Mr. Gorney in 1991 for the Mary Boone Gallery in SoHo, the epicenter of hot ’80s art stars, Mr. Rollins’s more collectively minded friends accused him of selling out. Indeed, the group occupied a strange position: Their collaborative working method opposed the idea of art stardom and individual authorship, yet they were embraced by the art market. Sometimes the issues were more personal. In an article in New York magazine in 1991, several former members of K.O.S. accused Mr. Rollins of being emotionally abusive, and of spending too much money on himself. Mr. Rollins said they were retaliating for being kicked out of K.O.S., and several current members defended him. Mr. Rollins never married, although he had a long-term relationship with the singer Kate Pierson of the rock group the B-52’s. He is survived by his mother; his brother, Ronny; and his sisters, Carlene and Cindy Rollins. Mr. Rollins was highly motivated from an early age. He said that when he was about 5 he wrote a note to his parents: “Dear Mom and Dad, when I grow up I’m going to be an artist, a teacher and a scientist. Don’t get in my way.” Continue reading the main story","Mr. Rollins devoted almost all of his career to an unusual combination of art-making and teaching, and to the group known as Tim Rollins + K.O.S.",2018-01-08T22:42:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Tim Rollins Dies at 62; Turned Bronx Teenagers Into Art Stars,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/obituaries/tim-rollins-dies-at-62-turned-bronx-teenagers-into-art-stars.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/03rollins-obit2/03rollins-obit2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,epicenter,1

Vanessa Romo,"Rescuers are seen entering a building that collapsed onto its side from an early morning 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, Wednesday, Feb. 7 2018. Tian Jun-hsiung/AP A series of earthquakes is rocking Taiwan, leaving two dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Associated Press, which cites Taiwan's Premier William Lai. The temblors started late Tuesday night, toppling buildings, destroying one bridge, and buckling paved streets along the island's eastern coast. The quakes continue to jolt the area near Hualien County through early Wednesday morning. The latest AP tally reports 144 people are injured. Four buildings have collapsed and one bridge has been damaged, Taiwan's National Fire Agency told ABC News. The largest quake so far was reported at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday night local time, registering at 6.4 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey. The Central Weather Bureau, which tracks seismic activity in Taiwan, reported the epicenter of the earthquake was at sea about 18.3 kilometers north of Hualien City. The Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. According to ABC, ""there were over 100 guests in the hotel at the time of the quake, and at least three people remain trapped, the department said. Firefighters are continuing to deal with gas leaks and fires as a result of the quake."" And, the AP says, Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel is tilting. Compilation footage posted to Twitter by the China Global Television Network shows a building tilting on its side over a line of cars parked along the street. People can be seen running down the street, carrying ladders to climb over the rubble and reach people still inside the collapsed building. Another clip shows the damage caused inside a store. A handful of employees race out of frame as merchandise is shaken off the shelves and onto the ground. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, says the temblors have continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday. There have been three aftershock quakes over 5.0 so far. And, he added, these are just the latest in a series of quakes that began last week. The AP reported the 6.4 temblor followed one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien, which lies along the famed ""Pacific Rim of Fire"" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia. This is a developing story. Some facts reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene.

"Sarah Rahal, Mark Hicks","Amherstburg is east of Grosse Ile. (Photo: USGS) A small earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and southeast Michigan on Thursday night and sent startled residents outside and online looking for answers. A magnitude 3.6 quake originated near Amherstburg, Ontario, just across the Detroit River, about 15.5 miles south of Detroit, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was felt at least 40 miles away in parts of Downriver and Dearborn. After the rumbles radiated across the region, those who felt it posted reaction on social media and websites, some saying they thought it was lightning, an explosion or a crash on an interstate. “It was so weird &amp; scary!” one user wrote on Twitter. “I heard a boom noise and then 3 seconds later I felt a tremor beneath my feet.” The temblor occurred about 8 p.m., said Ian Lee, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “They’re relatively rare, but it’s not the first time there’s been an earthquake in the area,” Lee said. The last earthquake that struck Michigan — not counting the 2.0 quake that followed a meteor strike in Metro Detroit in January — was a 4.0 in Galesburg, near Kalamazoo on May 2, 2015, he said. The USGS considers 3-3.9 a minor earthquake, “felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings,” according to its website. “Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck.” Soon after the first trembling began, comments on CSEM-EMSC, an independent scientific organization and provider of real-time earthquake warnings, flooded the site. “It was loud like thunder that kept rumbling not a lot of shaking just vibrating,” said a post from Amherstburg. “Very loud, dogs freaked. Lasted maybe 30 seconds total,” said another post. Remarks from Woodhaven said residents felt the quake in their homes. Residents from Trenton reported shaking for 30 seconds. “I’ve been in a few Earthquakes from the Michigan fault line,” another post said. “This one felt different. We could hear it coming, before we felt it, which I don’t ever remember hearing before. Wife actually commented: “What’s that noise?”... then we felt the tremor go through the house.” The relative rarity of a quake alarmed many area residents. One user likened the shaking to feeling “like someone hit the store with a truck.” Another wondered if the rumbles came from the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in southeast Michigan. “The epicenter was a few KM from our house,” the user tweeted. “Very sharp and loud initial Bang. Followed by a minute or two of low booms and rumbles. Thought Fermi 2 blew up.” The Monroe County plant is run by DTE Energy Co. The facility was not affected by the temblor, said Je’well Pearson, a utility spokeswoman. “It’s all quiet over here.” Thursday’s heaving was the second uncommon disturbance to ripple through southeast Michigan in 2018. The meteor hit Earth around 8:10 p.m. Jan. 16, sparking a 2.0 magnitude earthquake in the Detroit area, the USGS reported. Meteorite hunters soon went on a spree to find pieces of the fireball. srahal@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2vw7OT6","The Detroit News Magnitude 3.6 earthquake hits near Windsor The Detroit News A magnitude 3.6 earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and Downriver in Michigan on Thursday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

JESS BIDGOOD,"“The Democratic Party is not behind him pushing him up the hill to victory, because they don’t have a wagon for him to ride in right now,” said Mark Kennedy, a former state Supreme Court justice and erstwhile chairman of the Democratic Party. “He’s got to do it all by himself.” To win, analysts say, Mr. Jones needs to galvanize black voters’ support and try to pick off moderate white Republicans repulsed by Mr. Moore. Mr. Jones’s supporters are trying to make headway in counties that voted 65 percent or more for President Trump. Even as some polls show Mr. Jones gaining support — and perhaps, after the allegations, opening a lead — he faces stiff odds. “He knows that if he wins,” said Parker Griffith, a former Alabama congressman and an unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor in 2014, “it will be by the skin of his teeth.” The path to victory for Mr. Jones would most likely run through places like Shelby County, which contains Helena, which supported Mr. Moore’s opponent, Luther Strange, in the Senate primary. “That’s turf that has been Republican,” said Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster based in Alabama. “Shelby County and the Jefferson County suburbs would have been the epicenter of where Doug Jones can find voters against Roy Moore that just have not been in play for Democrats in a generation.” Photo Elena Mason, 34, center, spoke with two Democratic canvassers, Andrea Porter, left, and Beth Mulvey, outside her home in West Anniston, Ala., on Sunday. Credit Audra Melton for The New York Times And so on Saturday, a group of about 17 canvassers organized by the county’s Democratic Party took it upon themselves to go and find some. “For so long, in this area, if you were a Democratic in a social setting, you just kept your mouth shut,” said Doug Hoffman, the vice chairman of the local party, which he said has grown from a handful of members two years ago to 120 paying members now. “Democrats are finally, at last, out here in the suburbs.” Wending his way through a winding subdivision, Mr. Hoffman, clad in a Doug Jones T-shirt and practical loose walking pants, found a willing listener in Samuel Davis Jr., 53, an employee of the Birmingham Waterworks. “You got one of those big signs I can put in my front yard?” Mr. Davis asked. He planned to support Mr. Jones despite reservations about the accusations against Mr. Moore. “This could have come out long before,” Mr. Davis said. “You had to really question what motivated people to come out.” But other canvassers, like Bill and Becky Murphy of nearby Chelsea, met more resistance, like the Republican who shut the door with a quick “sorry.” And there was Sandy Chatfield, 68, a registered Republican who had voted for Mr. Strange in the primary but had decided to vote for Mr. Moore despite the allegations. “They do give me some pause, but I’m not going to blanket throw him under the bus,” Ms. Chatfield said, adding, “I just think it’s not worth losing the Senate.” Mr. Hoffman, meanwhile, was methodically handing his business card to every receptive voter he met, urging them to join the Democrats for meetings or a monthly social at the Margarita Grill (where, he promised, they could “talk politics and feel comfortable.”). “This thing,” he said, referring to the buzz around the special election, “is a gift to Democrats to get organized.” In recent decades, the state Democratic Party has been known more for its dysfunction than for decisive victories, with the party’s influence now mostly limited to some local governments, including mayor’s offices in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The Democratic Party’s problems in Alabama track with the broader shift in the South’s political leanings and loyalties. But as Republicans have taken over Alabama politics, the Democratic Party has done little to help itself. Photo A sign for Mr. Jones across the street from Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in Gadsden, Ala., on Sunday. Credit Audra Melton for The New York Times An intraparty feud in the mid-1980s helped a Republican to win the governor’s office. (That governor, Guy Hunt, ultimately appointed Mr. Moore to a circuit court judgeship in 1992.) The kingmaking, Democratic-backing Alabama Education Association, a group once so powerful that its longtime leader was known as “Governor Hubbert,” saw its influence collapse. Corruption investigations and convictions gave Republicans ammunition to complain about Democratic self-dealing in Montgomery, the capital. And although Republican factionalism now draws most of the attention in Alabama, the state’s Democrats have long held a reputation as a fractured bunch beset by rivalries and fiefs. As Democratic activists warned that the party had become sclerotic and disorganized, the electoral defeats piled up. Since 1995, Democrats have held the governor’s office for just four years, and in 2010, they lost complete control of the Legislature after 136 years. Four years later, no Democratic nominee to be a constitutional officer, including governor and attorney general, won more than 41 percent of the statewide vote. Democrats did not even put up a nominee for the United States Senate seat that Mr. Jones could now seize. The party’s weakness has left the Jones campaign without some of the resources candidates in other states can take for granted. “There’s just no data in the database,” said Daniel Deriso, the former operations and field director for the campaign for Randall Woodfin, the mayor-elect of Birmingham. “They had to build it all from the ground up. Others here, like State Representative Anthony Daniels, blame national Democrats for treating Alabama like “flyover country,” and they have been working to build infrastructure and capitalize on emerging progressive currents on their own. “Doug Jones should be up by 20 points,” Mr. Daniels said. “Until the Democratic Party nationally starts looking at the South, and focusing on rebuilding the South, then they’re going to see a blood bath in places they may feel are competitive, like right now.” Mr. Jones’s campaign is trying to compete in other places where Democrats do not typically make a strong showing, like Anniston, a city of 22,000 in the eastern part of the state where the campaign opened an office last week. “I don’t know what will happen,” said Cyndy Porter, 70, an independent voter who had never canvassed for a candidate before she went out for Mr. Jones there this weekend, “but we’re trying.” Back in Helena, some of the Democrats were glad to at least be in the game this time. “This is a backyard fight,” said Jerry McDonald, 67, one of the canvassers. “This is Alabama versus Auburn. Pick your side, we’re slugging it out.” Alan Blinder contributed reporting from Birmingham, Ala., and Alexander Burns from Austin, Tex.

Asia Times staff,"The extent of the death and destruction wrought by a twin earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi will become more clear on Tuesday as authorities and rescue workers reach affected areas that until now have been inaccessible due to broken infrastructure. Authorities provisionally put the death toll at 844 on Tuesday, a figure based largely on destruction in the capital of Palu. Reports indicate that figure will likely rise dramatically as rescuers reach outlying areas of the islands, including communities that were closer to Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake’s epicenter. Authorities have said they fear whole communities may have been swept away by a tsunami which dramatic video footage taken by residents showed crashing into coastal areas of the capital, Palu. The killer wave has devastated infrastructure, leaving affected areas without electricity and fuel. As of Tuesday, nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of stricken areas, Reuters reported. Also on Tuesday, some of the dead were taken to a mass grave for burial. Grieve for the people of Central Sulawesi, we all grieve together, President Joko Widodo said on Twitter late on Sunday. Vice President Jusuf Kalla had said earlier that the death toll could rise into the “thousands.” Rescuers are expected today to reach Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which have been cut off from communications since Friday, agencies reported. The districts have a combined population of 1.4 million, the reports said. The situation in the affected [Donggala] areas is nightmarish, Jan Gelfand, head of an International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies office in Jakarta, said in a statement. The city of Palu has been devastated and first reports out of Donggala indicate that it has also been hit extremely hard. While rescuers endeavor to locate and provide assistance to survivors, Widodos government is scrambling to show a competent and prompt response amid rising questions about its failure to warn residents of the incoming tsunami. News agencies reported that dozens of people were trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in Palu. On Monday, Widodo told reporters rescuing those trapped people was a priority. The evacuation is not finished yet, there are many places where the evacuation couldnt be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive, Widodo said to reporters. He said the government was sending “as much food supplies as possible” by military transport aircraft from the national capital. On Tuesday, a navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time was due to be deployed to help with the evacuation. State-owned oil and gas company Pertamina started distributing diesel fuel to crucial facilities like hospitals and electricity company PLN, as well as for search and rescue operations in Palu and Donggala, the Jakarta Post reported. But hard questions are rising in particular over why the meteorological and geophysics agency, known as BMKG, issued a tsunami warning soon after the quake hit, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Officials have claimed that the tsunami warning was still in place when the killer wave hit coastal areas. Videos of the wave as it hit Palu taken by residents in high rise buildings showed people on the beach and beachside roads apparently unaware as the massive water surge approached. Those images harked to the December 26, 2004 tsunami caused by an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra that killed 120,000 people in Indonesia, largely in the northern Aceh province. The lack of early warning systems contributed to the high death toll in that disaster. Other critical questions surround why warning systems established in the wake of that disaster appear to have failed to warn citizens on Friday. NDMAs Nugroho told reporters that none of the tsunami buoys used to detect the waves had been operational since 2012 due to a lack of funding. Widodos government is bidding to appear more responsive in the disasters aftermath, so far with mixed results. On Sunday, the president visited a housing complex smashed by the quake while calling on survivors for “patience” as assistance started to trickle into affected areas that were still being rattled by aftershocks. I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications, he said. He assured residents that the ruins would be rebuilt, according to reports. The Jakarta Post said in a commentary that while disaster-related authorities say public awareness campaigns on natural disasters have continued for years, including in Central Sulawesi, it was evident in how easily buildings collapsed that leaders and city planners had not implemented earthquake-resistant building codes and standards. At the same time, there are risks that the disasters aftermath could tilt towards anomie amid rising reports, including videos posted to social media, of widespread looting. Television images showed scores of residents shouting were hungry, we need food as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while footage from elsewhere showed people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall, Reuters reported. Internal Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses that suffered from looting would be compensated. The apparent official condoning of looting is raising hackles with local retailers who claim that at least 40 damaged outlets have been affected. We are concerned about the government’s arrogance in allowing people to loot goods from retail outlets in Palu and Donggala, without [first] coordinating with their owners or management, or with the association, said Roy Nicholas Mandey, chairman of the Indonesian Retailers Association, according to local reports. Local residents had also stolen fuel from the trucks of state-owned oil and gas giant Pertamina, according to reports. Tjahjo has since denied he made any statement condoning looting as a means to distribute goods to affected populations. On Monday, a witness quoted by Reuters said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while a stream of residents headed out. One aid worker quoted anonymously by Reuters spoke of growing lawlessness and threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel. The state energy company, Pertamina, said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesias logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tons of rice. On Monday, Widodo authorized the country to accept international assistance to deal with the aftermath, according to a tweet by Indonesia’s Investment Coordinating Board. It was not immediately clear what types of assistance the government will allow. Widodo’s government shunned outside assistance after an earthquake devastated the eastern island of Lombok earlier this year. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, meanwhile, said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah (US$37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported. But Widodo’s government will likely need to reach much deeper into its coffers to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe that increasingly risks being exacerbated by lawless chaos.

Shinichi Saoshiro,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, gaining a firmer footing after a week of heavy losses, although increasing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West have fanned geopolitical concerns and capped gains. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.25 percent, crawling away from a 19-month trough touched on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei bounced 0.6 percent following a decline of nearly 2 percent the previous day. The disappearance in Turkey earlier this month of a Saudi journalist critical of Riyadh has provoked an international outcry against the oil-rich kingdom, which has rattled its financial markets. U.S. President Donald Trump has sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia over the case, potentially straining the relationship between the strategic allies. “The focus of the markets has turned to the Middle East due to the Saudi incident. And with U.S. stocks still struggling, other equity markets will have a difficult time bouncing convincingly,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The United States has been the epicenter of the recent market tumult, with Wall Street shares being hit by higher Treasury yields. U.S. shares will have to find their feet first.” Saudi Arabia’s riyal currency retreated overnight to 3.7525 to the dollar - its weakest in two years. Wall Street shares were dragged down overnight by a retreat in technology shares amid lingering worries over high U.S. bond yields. [.N] The Dow has lost 4.5 percent this month, pulled away from record peaks, as long-term Treasury yields soared to their highest level since 2011. Higher yields are seen eroding the allure of equities. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.15 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index was last up 0.1 percent. Data on Tuesday showed China’s factory-gate inflation cooled for a third straight month in September amid ebbing domestic demand, pointing to more pressure on the world’s second biggest economy as it remains locked in an intensifying trade war with the United States. Perceived safe havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc have found supported following the hit riskier assets have taken. The dollar traded at 111.95 yen, not far from a one-month low of 111.625 brushed overnight. Against the dollar, the Swiss currency stood at 0.9882 franc after advancing 0.5 percent the previous day. The euro was little changed at $1.1574, after rising 0.2 percent the previous day. Sterling was at $1.3145, having bounced from a one-week low of $1.3080 plumbed on Monday amid a stalemate over the post-Brexit status of Britain’s land border with Ireland. Currency market focus was on the U.S. Treasury’s semiannual currency report due later in the day, with investors waiting to see Washington’s view on China after media reports last week that the department has not labeled Beijing a currency manipulator. “It is clear that China does not meet the criteria of currency manipulator based on the current assessment, as the country’s current account surplus as a percent of GDP has fallen below 3 percent,” wrote strategists at OCBC Bank. China’s yuan was a shade weaker at 6.924 per dollar in onshore trading. In commodities, tension between the United States, the world’s top oil consumer, and Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest producers, pushed up crude prices on concerns about supply. [O/R] Brent crude futures rose 0.3 percent to $81.00 a barrel, stretching gains from Monday. Safe haven gold was at $1,225.51 an ounce, in striking distance of a near three-month high of $1,233.26 scaled on Monday.","Asian stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, gaining a firmer footing after a week of heavy losses, although increasing tensions between Saudi Arabia and the West have fanned geopolitical concerns and capped gains.",2018-10-16T03:48:27Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Asia stocks edge up but Saudi tensions limit gains,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/asia-stocks-edge-up-but-saudi-tensions-limit-gains-idUSKCN1MQ02J,https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181016&t=2&i=1315151116&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE9F021,reuters,Reuters,epicenter,1
https://www.facebook.com/jlachenbach,"Yes, that was an earthquake. It wasn’t much of one. People conceivably have sneezed harder than the violence produced by Thursday afternoon’s earthquake. But it was unusual, centered in the normally quiescent state of Delaware, and it could be felt as far as the nation’s capital and its Virginia suburbs. The tremor occurred at 4:47 p.m., centered about 6 miles northeast of Dover, Del., and about 5 miles deep. The U.S. Geological Survey gave varying estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude, at one point rating it as high as a 5.1 but later downgrading it to a 4.1 — a modest event that did not appear to cause any damage, much less fatalities. The Delaware Emergency Management Agency told the Dover Post that there were no reports of damage or injuries. Geophysicist Dale Grant of the USGS said an earthquake in Delaware is “exceptionally rare.” The earthquake was felt across a broad swath of the Washington-New York corridor, and into the Hudson River Valley and parts of Connecticut and Long Island, according to the USGS “Did You Feel It?” page. Almost everywhere, the shaking was reported by residents to be either “weak” or “light.” In comments posted to The Post’s Capital Weather Gang blog, people in and around Washington reported rattling windows or the sense that a big truck had just passed down the street. A reader in Hyattsville wrote, “ My toddler and I looked at each other like ‘what was that?!?’ House shuddered for about a second, 3 shakes. At first I thought the mailman had thrown a big package onto our porch (nope). Then I thought maybe a tree branch had fallen in our backyard (nope). The street was quiet, so not construction or a big truck or a low plane flying overhead. I correctly deduced it must have been an earthquake!” [ Magnitude 4.1 earthquake near Dover, Del., rattles Mid-Atlantic ] Closer to the epicenter, the earthquake was more dramatic. A reader in downtown Dover wrote, “ felt house shake violently….thought it was a gas explosion.” The magnitude scale is logarithmic, and a 5.0 magnitude event is 10 times more powerful than 4.0. The Aug. 23, 2011, earthquake centered near Mineral, Va., which damaged the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral, had an estimated magnitude of 5.8, and was one of the three strongest quakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the last century. There is no known fault associated with this earthquake. The hazard maps produced by the USGS do not show Delaware having a significant seismic hazard. Those maps may have to be revised as a result of Thursday’s tremor. There has been debate, sometimes quite acrimonious, within the scientific community about the usefulness of hazard maps, because earthquakes often happen in places of no known seismic hazard, or the ground shakes with greater intensity than had been imagined. The East Coast has a limited history of major earthquakes, but experts say that citizens should not assume they are free of seismic hazard. Charleston, S.C., was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1886 that killed 110 people. Indeed, New York City is considered highly vulnerable over the long term because so many masonry structures lack the kind of reinforced steel that is required in places with more of a known earthquake risk.

Right after that key vote, MEPs will fan out across Europe, returning to their home countries to start campaigning for the May elections. This timing is crucial, because it means that MEPs are really interested in whether their actions will cost them support from voters.

If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that your vote depends on their vote: the 2019 Pledge, brought to you by Epicenter Works, calls on MEPs to publicly pledge to reject Article 13. 44 MEPs have signed it so far, and work has just begun.
The pledge's website lets you enter your country and your phone number and it will connect you with MEPs who have not yet taken the pledge and let you talk to them about why it's important that they do.
This is a key juncture, a moment when the fate of the internet itself hangs in the balance (and not just in Europe). It's also a moment when your voice really counts. Not one of these MEPs is going to campaign for re-election on the basis of their work to pass the Copyright Directive, but they know that their opponents will be out their campaigning to unseat any MEP who voted to destroy the internet.

Emily Sullivan,"A total picture of the destruction from last week's earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia remains unclear, despite days of efforts to aid the living and recover the dead. The Central Sulawesi local government has declared a 14-day state of emergency as those efforts continue. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck along the coastal district of Donggala on Friday, causing at least 1,200 deaths and displacing tens of thousands more. Most of the known dead are from the city of Palu, and many areas thought to be hard-hit by the disaster have yet to be assessed for damage and deaths. The U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction says in all up to 1.6 million people may have been affected by the earthquake and tsunami. The country has also suffered a series of aftershocks, according to the United States Geological Survey. Several jolts some as strong as 6.0-magnitude hit Sumba, an island hundreds of miles away from Sulawesi, on Monday. More than 60,000 Indonesians have been displaced by the quake and tsunami, Chief Security Minister Wiranto told reporters on Monday. The country's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, known as BNPB, is working to assist the displaced with shelter, hot meals and other aid. Relief coordination posts will be set up ""soon"" in the regencies of Palu, Donggala, Sigi and Parigi Mouton, according to the Jakarta Post. The agency has set aside the equivalent of $37.6 million in relief funds and declared a state of emergency through Oct. 11. By declaring that emergency, ""it will be easier for both the regional and national government to mobilize personnel, logistics, equipment as well as money to fulfill the needs of the affected area and people,"" BNBP spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the Post. Meanwhile, many regions remain at a standstill. The country's central airport where many have camped out is unusable and aid must arrive to the hardest-hit areas by truck, slowing down efforts. Many gas stations in Palu have sustained heavy damage, and residents trying to leave the area are stuck waiting for gas. Some survivors outside of Palu are intercepting aid trucks to plunder supplies and other essentials as aid begins to trickle in, according to the Post. As NPR has reported, local and military officials arranged for a mass burial site for victims in Palu, overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies. ""Most of the deaths resulted from people being buried under rubble or being struck by the tsunami,"" reported the Jakarta Post. Others were buried when quake-loosened soils lose their cohesion a phenomenon known as liquefaction. Hundreds of people remain buried in mud in the Palu neighborhood of Petobo, according to the Associated Press. Rescue teams are attempting to dig them out. Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla told The S outh China Morning Post the final death toll may rise to the ""thousands"" once other regions outside of Palu are assessed such as Donggala, close to the quake's epicenter, where relief workers have been unable to reach. In a video by The Guardian, the region is strewn with devastation. Fallen buildings have flattened many cars as well. ""We have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying,"" said Jan Gelfand, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Country Cluster Support in a statement. ""There are more than 300,000 people living there. This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,"" said Gelfand.","Communications are still down to some of the hardest-hit regions on the island of Sulawesi.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Students participate in a training program to take shelter from an earthquake at a school in Seoul, South Korea, Nov. 16, 2017. (Photo: YONHAP, EPA-EFE) SEOUL, South Korea – A 5.4 magnitude earthquake that was South Korea’s second-strongest in decades damaged infrastructure, injured dozens of people and left about 1,500 homeless, officials said Thursday. No deaths have been reported since the quake rattled the southeastern coastal region around the port city of Pohang on Wednesday afternoon. As of Thursday morning, 1,536 people had been forced to evacuate their homes and 57 people were injured, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety said in a statement. More than 1,000 houses and dozens of other buildings and cars were damaged or destroyed, and cracks and other damage were found in military facilities, bridges, port facilities and water supply facilities. Media images showed crumbled walls piled on damaged cars, broken windows and cracks in buildings. The quake also forced the education ministry to put off the university entrance exam for one week because some buildings chosen as test venues had cracks and students in the southeastern region were displaced from their homes and complained of anxieties. The annual test administered by the government is a huge national event in South Korea, where diplomas from top colleges often guarantee better jobs and spouses. It’s the second-strongest quake in South Korea since the country officially began monitoring them in 1978. The biggest quake occurred in September 2016, when a 5.8 magnitude occurred near the ancient city of Gyeongju, which is close to Pohang. That quake also caused injuries but no deaths. South Korea’s state-run Korea Meteorological Administration said the epicenter of Wednesday’s quake was inside Pohang while the U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered about 9.3 kilometers (5.8 miles) northwest of the port city. The shaking was felt in Seoul, more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) away. South Korea has relatively little seismic activity, unlike neighboring Japan.

http://www.facebook.com/Q13FOX,"SEATTLE — Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone. An earthquake is coming. You have 15 seconds – at most – before it hits. How much could you really prepare for in 15 seconds? A lot, says Douglas Given, United States Geological Survey’s Early Warning Coordinator. “Early warning, of even a few seconds, would give you a jump on protective action,” Given says. “There are lots of situations where a few seconds or even tens of seconds of warning is enough to get out of harm’s way.” How does it work? USGS's Shake Alert Early Warning system is rolling out this year in Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Using a network of 850 sensors, the Shake Alert Early Warning system will detect an earthquake at one seismograph, then send warnings to other areas before that same earthquake can hit a few miles away. The initial roll out will give warnings to some governmental and transportation agencies, but the ultimate hope is to have an sent to cellphones in the area. It's not an earthquake predictor, Given says, but a way to know a few seconds early that a potentially destructive earthquake is coming. ""The amount of time you get depends on your distance from the earthquake,"" Given says, noting that locations further away from the epicenter will have more warning time. Given and other researchers started building Shake Alert in 2006. They hope to put 1,675 sensors down, and have a comprehensive warning system for the entire West Coast. This year's launch will serve agencies capable of utilizing an automatic system, such as one that could immediately shut off heavy machinery or slow trains. ""There are hundreds of things that can done with an automatic system,"" Given said. 'This can help reduce mass casualty events' San Francisco's rapid transportation system, BART, has been using Shake Alert since 2012, Given says. When an earthquake is spotted, BART almost instantaneously slows down its trains through a computer system. With research showing trains have a tendency to derail during an earthquake, this automatic application may save hundreds. ""They saw the value of (Shake Alert) very early on,"" Given says. ""This can help reduce mass casualty events. There are all sorts of applications for early warning."" But the idea of the Seattle resident getting a text alert - notifying them that an earthquake is coming - is about 3 to 5 years off, Given says. A personal early warning system is blocked by the speed in which alerts can be sent. Working with the cell companies and agencies like FEMA, it would still take almost a minute to send out mass warnings. Too long for an earthquake warning, Given says. ""One of the specific limitations of our limited public roll-out is the ability to do mass notifications to the public fast enough,"" Given says. ""It's not an unreasonable expectation, it's just not possible to do it yet."" How much warning will we ever get? Given says USGS is working with FEMA and the cell industry to reduce delays. A pilot project for individuals is in the works at a few agencies in Los Angeles. Given was not sure which companies and agencies in Seattle signed up for the early warning system, noting it would be ""a number of technical and industrial users."" He knew of at least one water company that planned to use the Shake Alert system in Seattle, shutting down certain pumps to prevent against damage. Given was clear to remind people this isn't earthquake prediction, it's just ""very rapid detection."" Ten or 20 seconds seems about the best warning we can get, as a sort of earthquake prediction seems is almost impossible, Given says. ""You're not ever going to get 10 minutes,"" Given says. The USGS will host a free public lecture on the Shake Alert system in California Thursday night, and it's available on live-stream.","SEATTLE -- Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone.

Tyler Durden,"There is a new Gold Rush 2.0 currently underway across the world, and prospectors have their eyes set on Winnipeg City in Manitoba, Canada. In 1848 through 1849, the news of gold quickly spread around. People from Hawaii and Latin America were the first to hear the breaking news. Next came the rest of the U.S., Europe, Australia, and China in 1849, as the peak rush was seen in 1852, after gold reserves became harder to mine. The buzz around bitcoin is similar, although information dissemination is now much quicker and as the euphoria of bitcoin mining spreads across the globe, many cryptocurrency players have started their descent onto Manitoba in search of cheap power for their digital mining operations. The gold rush ushered in the development of California in the 1850s and ultimately it became a state. Roads, churches, schools, and entire towns were built, to house the gold miners who sought nothing more than to extract the yellow metal from the foothills. A similar fate may await one Canadian city. CBC News has learned that international investors have had interviews with “commercial real estate companies, economic development organizations, cryptocurrency industry players and Manitoba Hydro,” who view the area as a “top-tier location” to open up a mining shop. CentrePort Canada, North America’s largest inland port, offers 20,000 acres of cheap commercial land in Winnipeg, says early interest from Asian investors and South American companies who want to mine cryptocurrencies is currently underway. CentrePort president and CEO Diane Gray said, “we’ve had inquiries from very large non-Asian companies, some of which have roots in North America and are looking to expand significantly.” “They’re having site visits and meetings with Manitoba Hydro and whomever else they feel are relevant to their decision-making process. So I would say strong interest, but still speculative.” Is the next bitcoin boom area in Manitoba? The environmental downside in mining cryptocurrencies is that it requires a tremendous amount of energy (See: Each Bitcoin Transaction Uses As Much Energy As Your House In A Week ). CBC explains why a bitcoin transaction consumes a lot of energy, furthermore highlights North America’s cheapest cities for electricity costs in 2017. Here, Winnipeg City in Manitoba, Canada ranks number one, while Toronto ranks last. New York is not too far behind Toronto, ranked number 19. In lieu of a central banking authority controlling transactions involving cryptocurrencies, a public digital ledger controlled by a network of users records every virtual-currency transaction. However, this record-keeping process requires computers around the globe to solve complex mathematical problems and then verify the output. When this is complete, the transaction and the solved equation is added to what is called a “blockchain” as a permanent record. People who purchase these specialized math-solving computers around the world don’t do it for free. Their reward is payment through the creation and issuance of new bitcoin. They become, essentially, tech-era gold miners — hence the term “bitcoin miners.” Interesting facts about Bitcoin mining and electricity consumption: In the past month alone, Bitcoin mining electricity consumption is estimated to have increased by 29.98% If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining will consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020. Estimated annualized global mining revenues: $7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion) Estimated global mining costs: $1.5 billion USD (£1.1 billion) Number of Americans who could be powered by bitcoin mining: 2.4 million (more than the population of Houston) Number of Britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: 6.1 million (more than the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Bradford, Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon, Coventry, Leicester &amp; Nottingham combined) Or Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Bitcoin Mining consumes more electricity than 12 US states (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming) Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption is set to explode. In this context it's easy to figure out why bitcoin miners have Manitoba, and Winnipeg, in their crosshairs: the area hosts cheap energy through hydroelectricity, along with the “lowest average annual temperatures of major North American cities”— just perfect for cooling computers with cheap energy. Ryan Behie, vice-president and managing director for CBRE Winnipeg says, more than a dozen groups are looking at commercial properties in the area for setting up bitcoin mining operations. “The issue is that this commands a tremendous amount of power, so much so that in my discussions with [Manitoba] Hydro about what they can offer in terms of power at any particular locations in the city of Winnipeg, there are few, frankly, if any sites that work.” Bob Antymniuk, senior director of sales and leasing with Capital Real Estate, says his team of experts have canvased areas in Manitoba, and Winnipeg, but “there’s not many of those types of buildings that have the types of power requirements that these guys want.” Antymniuk indicates the infrastructure in Manitoba, and Winnipeg is severely lacking the requirements for bitcoin operations, but we must add, this is the perfect time to enter before the rush starts. On the other hand, Manitoba Hydro officials aren’t convinced bitcoin mining operations in the region need the extra power upgrades—yet. Officials are unsure if cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, and actions by the power company today could be premature. “The key difference lately has been the magnitude of the requests to establish dedicated bitcoin and cryptocurrency farms,” said Manitoba Hydro spokesperson Bruce Owen. “ To put the potential consumption into perspective, the cryptocurrency requests coming into Manitoba Hydro recently are for the equivalent electric consumption of about 1,900 average Manitoba hom es.” One local cryptocurrency insider says, there are more than 20 mining operations of different sizes throughout the area. It’s hard to put an exact figure on the number because many want to remain anonymous. Nick Burley, chief operating officer of Fiber Hosting, a Winnipeg web hosting company said, “if it ends up turning into a situation where it does become concrete for the long term, we will risk giving up our early lead in the industry to other players around the world, which will unfortunately [mean losing] out on job opportunities for Manitobans in high-tech jobs.” According to CBC, Burley, himself a bitcoin miner, estimates about 100 skilled miners are employed in the province, and many more are coming with an infrastructure that is in need of an upgrade. “If it is seen that Manitoba is too slow to react to the demand, then it could be a situation where we lose competitiveness in that space.” Nevertheless, Manitoba, and Winnipeg could be in the beginning stages of a new gold rush, however this time the expansion is north and it’s digital, as the hunt for cheap energy and cold climate is top on every bitcoin miner’s mind.","There is a new Gold Rush 2.0 currently underway across the world, and prospectors have their eyes set on Winnipeg City in Manitoba, Canada.

Jonathan Shieber,"CrossCut Ventures, a Los Angeles-based seed investment firm has just closed its fourth (and largest) fund with $125 million in new cash. It’s been a long road for the firm’s three co-founders, who have been investing in Los Angeles since 1997. In that time they’ve seen the city’s technology scene evolve in fits and starts, but now, with companies like Snap, Dollar Shave Club and Oculus bringing billions of dollars down from Silicon Valley, a wave of investor interest has followed — and with their new fund they stand to reap the benefits. “We’ve been looking for that since 2008,” which is when the firm launched its first institutional investment vehicle, says Brian Garrett, a co-founder and managing director at CrossCut. “we are now in a place where those tentpole companies, like Snap, and Oculus, and Dollar Shave Club … we can build those companies here.” Indeed, the seed stage investor has already had success with its previous investment vehicles, which have put $50 million in capital to work behind 70 companies that have raised $1.3 billion in follow-on funding. And 66% of those investments were made in companies based in Los Angeles. “Los Angeles is capturing the attention of institutional LPs, which is leading to the virtuous cycle of innovation. Tech companies have hired thousands of people and brought a ton of talent down here and those people will go off and start their own businesses,” Garrett says. Indeed, CrossCut had set out to raise only $100 million, but there was so much interest from limited partners — the funds that back venture firms — that the venture firm hit its hard cap for fundraising at $125 million. The firm has certainly come a long way from the $5 million it raised for its first vehicle in the dog days of 2008 as the global financial crisis was taking its toll on economies around the world. The entire CrossCut Ventures team: (from right) associate Sarah Moret; Clinton Foy, managing director; Brett Brewer, co-founder and managing director; Brian Garrett, co-founder and managing director; Rick Smith, co-founder and managing director; Michael Tam, associate From that small, first fund, things grew slowly and steadily for the partners at CrossCut, Garrett said. The firm’s second fund, raised in mid-2012, was a modest $16 million, and it raised a significantly larger fund in 2014 as the Los Angeles market as it exists now was beginning to take shape. The increasing investment pools in some senses mirror the pace of acceleration of the Los Angeles ecosystem, but in those early days, the CrossCut founder said things were not necessarily that rosy. “Here’s the story,” says Garrett. “[CrossCut co-founder] Rick Smith and I left cushy venture jobs to start Crosscut… I had no savings and bought a new house in the Pallisades with a big mortgage.” Then the bottom fell out of the economy. “There wasn’t a fee stream coming off the fund,” Garrett said. “I was consulting with anyone who would help me around strategy and business development… and got pulled in with a public company turnaround… a lot of what we were trying to do was replicate venture models in Brazil.” The company was called Que Pasa and Garrett helped it raise an $11 million PIPE. That deal, ultimately led to an acquisition. Meanwhile, another CrossCut co-founder, Brett Brewer had gone to a company in Kansas City called AdKnowledge. While still working with CrossCut, Brewer helped AdKnowledge raise $40 million from TCV and scaled the business to $300 million in revenue, Garrett told me. “We were the largest seed fund in LA at the time at $5 million we were running this thing out of coffee beans on nights and weekends,” Garrett said. In fact, the firm’s latest addition as partner, Clinton Foy, actually began at CrossCut as an unpaid venture partner back in 2014. “We brought him in as a partner ahead of fund three not even sure we were going to raise fund three. Foy has brought eSports, gaming, and mobile streaming experience to the partnership — and has already scored a pretty big win as the co-founder of the Immortals e-sports team. The first fund has now returned 4 times its money from 18 investments — 11 of which netted positive returns. And the firm’s second fund is one-third returned with a paper valuation at nearly 5 times its money, given the fair market value write ups of the deals in the portfolio, Garrett said. There are currently 32 companies in the portfolio and 12 of those investments were made in the last year. Typical check size for the new CrossCut fund will be potentially as much as half of a $2.5 million to $3.5 million dollar round, but the firm doesn’t want to stray too far from traditional early stage seed investing, according to Garrett. However, at nearly two times larger than any other seed fund in town, the firm has a bit more dry powder. As with previous vehicles, the fund will primarily look to invest in Los Angeles and Southern California, but it will look elsewhere too — as long as the potential investment has some need to tap the Los Angeles market, the firm is interested in taking a look. Los Angeles, could, however, occupy a more central place in the investment thesis given the activity from startups that exists here. Indeed, the appearance of new investment firms coming in at later rounds have made the city’s venture scene more robust, and brought a new attention to the companies coming out of LA. Investors like Mark Suster at Upfront Ventures have been beating the drum for Los Angeles as an epicenter for technology investment for a number of years. Through the Upfront Summit, which his firm launched a few years ago, Los Angeles investors and entrepreneurs have had a marquee showcase to pitch all of the things that Los Angeles can offer to a tech company — and the opportunity that exists for investors, Garrett said. But Upfront, which has been in Los Angeles since 1996, and other investment firms like Greycroft Partners, which established themselves in Los Angeles more recently (and, in the case of Greycroft, have offices in other geographies from which to commit capital) have managed to provide the later stage capital that was the oxygen the local ecosystem needed. For Garrett, the presence of a broader investment base is great for a firm like his, which need later stage investors to fund their portfolio companies past a Series A round (which is the time that CrossCut will tap out to let other investors lead). “What happened is that the ecosystem believed that there were next generation businesses to be built,” said Garrett. “For us it was Ophir [Tanz] at GumGum and Jason [Nazar] at DocStoc and David Lee.” That was around 2008 to 2011, right before Upfront Ventures began to really publicize Los Angeles as the hot new place to go for tech startups, according to Garrett. “I will fully then say that Mark Suster created a lot of awareness and a megaphone and a spotlight that got shone and we have been a great beneficiary of his outward efforts,” he said. These days, the firm’s investment interests are as diverse as the Los Angeles ecosystem it supports running the gamut from artificial intelligence, to blockchain technologies, to gaming and eSports. The firm has also backed companies in automation, “big data”, digital marketplaces, and software as a service. “I was CrossCut’s very first investment as they formed the fund back in 2008. It’s been amazing to watch their success and growth. They have quietly and humbly built one of the best reputations in VC by working tirelessly on behalf of their portfolio companies.” says Jason Nazar, founder of DocStoc (sold to Intuit) and now a co-founder of Comparably. “They deserve a lot of credit for catalyzing this ecosystem and were the first to recognize the opportunity and build a fund and brand around it.” At this point, for CrossCut and Los Angeles, the important thing is the solid foundation on which new startups are being built. “It’s a perfect storm of a lot of factors,” said Garrett, but the Los Angeles tech scene now has grown and “contributes to this idea that tis will not be a hyped and busted ecosystem.” Companies like Tesla and SpaceX have reinvigorated Los Angeles manufacturing, aerospace, and automotive industries, while young data scientists from the University of Southern California are doing amazing work around big data, Garrett said. “It’s a ten year story arc, right now there’s no branded money down here that is being built to catalyze innovation that has the ability to build a viable standalone investment firm in Southern California.” That’s an opportunity for a firm like CrossCut, with its new capitalization, to stake a pretty large claim for itself in a tech ecosystem that is still developing.","CrossCut Ventures, a Los Angeles-based seed investment firm has just closed its fourth (and largest) fund with $125 million in new cash.

Willa Frej,"With the epicenter of policymaking looming large in the background, activists on Tuesday placed 7,000 pairs of empty shoes across the Capitol lawn, an impossible-to-ignore symbol of the children lost to gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. Families who have lost children to shootings were invited to contribute their kids’ shoes, said global advocacy group Avaaz, which organized the event. “I’ll be traveling to DC literally wearing my son Daniel’s shoes, the ones he wore the day he died at Columbine,” said Tom Mauser, whose son was killed in the Columbine mass shooting. “I think this kind of event with shoes offers a very powerful metaphor both for how we miss the victims who once filled those shoes, and also for how we see ourselves wanting to walk in their place, seeking change, so that others don’t have to walk this painful journey.” People across the country, including celebrities, donated shoes to the display, which Avaaz said covered more than 10,000 square feet of grounds outside the Capitol. Several Democratic lawmakers visited the site, taking the opportunity to call out congressional inaction on gun reform. According to CNN, Avaaz took the 7,000 figure from a 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics report which claimed that almost 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds in the US every year. Calls for gun reform have intensified in the wake of the mass shooting at Parkland, Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, when 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz killed 17 students and school staff. The push for gun control has had mixed results. Florida Gov. Rick Scott last week signed into law a new gun control bill that enables some teachers who undergo proper training to carry concealed weapons, in addition to other restrictions like raising the minimum purchase age for guns from 18 to 21. The National Rifle Association sued the state in response. President Donald Trump initially indicated that he supported some gun control efforts, including raising the national purchasing age, but back-pedaled after meeting with the NRA. The White House instead unveiled a list of proposals including arming some teachers and enhanced background checks. He also established a Federal Commission on School Safety to provide further recommendations. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a bill to offer more resources to schools, in the form of mental health support, strengthened reporting systems and heightened security.

Rebecca Shapiro,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) painted a disturbing picture on Tuesday as she detailed her recent visit to multiple facilities in Texas where immigrant men, women and children, separated from their families, are being detained. In a lengthy report posted to Facebook, Warren said she flew to McAllen, Texas, to visit what she called the “epicenter” of President Donald Trump ’s zero tolerance immigration policy. She said her visit confirmed her worst fears, particularly about reuniting families that have been separated. “The girls are held separately in their own large cage,” Warren wrote of her visit to McAllen Customs and Border Protection processing center. “The children told us that they had come to the United States with family and didn’t know where they had been taken. Eleven years old. Twelve. Locked in a cage with strangers. Many hadn’t talked to their mothers or fathers. They didn’t know where they were or what would happen to them next.” The senator was also quick to point out that the children had nothing with them. “No books, no toys, no games,” she wrote. “They looked shell shocked.” Warren pointed out how the Trump administration ’s definitions of “separated” and “reunified” families add more chaos and confusion to a crisis that’s already affected thousands of children and parents. A family may be considered “reunified” if a child, separated from his or her parents, is sent to live with a distant relative they’ve never met, she wrote. “Some relatives may be unwilling to claim these children” because it would be inviting Immigration and Customs Enforcement to investigate their own families, she added. On the other hand, the Trump administration doesn’t consider a family “separated” if mothers and children are held together in the same facility though kept in separate cages without access to each other. Warren later met with a group of women whose children had been taken from them at Port Isabel, a South Texas facility the senator described as a jail, though it’s being referred to by authorities as a “reunification center.” “The women I met were traumatized, weeping, and begging for help. They don’t understand what is happening to them ― and they’re begging to be reunited with their kids,” she wrote. “The mothers say that they can hear babies cry at night.” For Warren’s full report, check out the Facebook post above.","""The mothers say that they can hear babies cry at night,"" the senator wrote of immigrant families detained in Texas.",2018-06-26T23:51:55Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Elizabeth Warren Details Immigration Center Visit In Gut-Wrenching Report,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-report-visit-immigrant-detention-centers_us_5b32bc2de4b0b5e692f23d92,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b32c13d2200006c03eec96e.png?cache=LtuYxN9EnD&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,epicenter,1

MARI YAMAGUCHI / AP,"TOKYO — A powerful earthquake hit wide areas on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido early Thursday, triggering landslides as well as causing the loss of power at nearly all of 3 million households and a nuclear power plant to go on a backup generator. A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck southern Hokkaido at 3:08 a.m. Thursday (18:08 GMT Wednesday) at the depth of 40 kilometers (24 miles), Japan’s Meteorological Agency said. The quake’s epicenter was east of the city of Tomakomai. It also struck Hokkaido’s prefectural capital of Sapporo, with a population of 1.9 million. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.6. No tsunami warning was issued. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said a man was found without vital signs in Tomakomai, and several people were reported missing in the nearby town of Atsuma. At least 20 other people were injured in nearby towns, though their conditions were not immediately known. Footage on NHK national television showed the moment the quake struck Muroran, with its camera violently shaking and all city lights going out a moment later. In nearby Sapporo, a mudslide hit a road, leaving several cars half buried. In the town of Atsuma, a massive landslide occurred on the side of a mountain, crushing houses at lower levels. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that the authorities have received hundreds of calls about people missing and buildings collapsing. Officials are doing their utmost for the search and rescue while they assess the extent of damage, he said. The central government set up a crisis management taskforce at the prime minister’s Office, Suga said. Three reactors at the Tomari nuclear plant were offline, but they are running on backup generators after losing external power because of the island-wide blackouts that also caused power loss at all 2.9 million households and disrupted traffic, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said. Spent fuel in storage pools was safely cooled on backup power that can last for a week, the agency said. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan destroyed both external and backup power to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, causing meltdowns. The earthquake also affected telephone service and television broadcasting in Sapporo.",No tsunami warning was issued,2018-09-05T23:45:22Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Powerful Earthquake Hits Japan, Leaving Millions of Households Without Power",http://time.com/5388096/earthquake-japan-hokkaido/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/japan-hokkaido-earthquake.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1
Associated Press,"(KAVIK RIVER CAMP, Alaska) — Alaska’s North Slope was hit Sunday by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the region, the state’s seismologist said. At 6:58 a.m. Sunday, the magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck an area 42 miles (67 kilometers) east of Kavik River Camp and 343 miles (551 kilometers) northeast of Fairbanks, the state’s second-biggest city. The U.S. Geological Survey says the earthquake had a depth of about 6 miles (9.9 kilometers.) State seismologist Mike West told the Anchorage Daily News that the earthquake was the biggest recorded in the North Slope by a substantial amount. “This is a very significant event that will take us some time to understand,” he told the Daily News. The previous most powerful quake in the North Slope was in 1995 at magnitude 5.2, West told the newspaper. The jump from a 5.2 to Sunday’s 6.4 is significant because earthquakes rapidly grow in strength as magnitude rises, he said. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake is 15.8 times bigger and 63.1 times stronger than a 5.2 earthquake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. “That’s why at 6.4 this changes how we think about the region,” West said. “It’s a little early to say how, but it’s safe to say this earthquake will cause a re-evaluation of the seismic potential of that area.” Later Sunday, another magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit at 1:15 p.m. near the city of Kaktovik on Alaska’s North Slope, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The epicenter was (65 kilometers) southwest of Kaktovik, which has about 290 people. The magnitude 6.4 earthquake that hit Sunday morning was felt by workers at the oil-production facilities in and around Prudhoe Bay, the Daily News reported. The newspaper says that Alyeska Pipeline said the earthquake did not damage the trans-Alaska pipeline. The company says in a tweet that “there are no operational concerns” related to the earthquake, but the pipeline will be inspected. Several aftershocks were reported across northern Alaska. The Alaska Earthquake Center says the earthquakes were felt across the eastern part of the state’s North Slope Borough and as far south as metro Fairbanks. The center adds that there are no reports of damage.","Alaska's North Slope was hit Sunday by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the region, the state's seismologist said",2018-08-13T01:25:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Alaska’s North Slope Hit by Strongest Quake Ever Recorded in the Region,http://time.com/5365097/alaska-north-slope-earthquake/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-952612878.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1

By Adam Bankhurst Nintendo has delayed its upcoming Nintendo Direct due to an earthquake that has struck the northern island of Hokkaido, Japan. Announced via Nintendo's Twitter, Nintendo made the decision to delay the 35-minute Nintendo Switch and 3DS Direct and will ""provide a new date and time in the near future."" The earthquake occurred early Thursday with a magnitude of 6.7 and follows Typhoon Jebi, the strongest typhoon to hit the mainland of Japan since 1993. Before Typhoon Jebi reached the mainland of Japan, ""the storm had sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph) and gusts of 165 kmh (102 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane."" According to CNN, the epicenter of the earthquake was located near the town of Atsuma, which is home to 40 residents, and lasted for almost a minute. Aftershocks may pose a threat for the next week, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already deployed over 4,000 defense force soldiers to help with rescue operations and, if needed, may raise that number up to 25,000.

Abdi Latif Dahir,"Africa just recorded the highest rate of modern-day enslavement in the world. Armed conflict, state-sponsored forced labor, and forced marriages were the main causes behind the estimated 9.2 million Africans who live in servitude without the choice to do so, according to the 2018 Global Slavery Index. And despite these practices being widespread, slavery has remained a largely invisible issue, in part, because it disproportionately affects the most marginalized members of society, such as minorities, women, and children. Slavery was especially prevalent in Eritrea and Mauritania, where slavery has even been, at times, an institutionalized practice. In Eritrea, for instance, the one-party state of president Isaias Afwerki has overseen a notorious national conscription service accused of drafting citizens for an indefinite period, contributing to the wave of refugees fleeing the country. Workers that have claimed that they were forced to work in the nation’s first modern mine are also currently suing the Vancouver-based mining company Nevsun that owns a majority stake in the mine. The situation is more acute in Mauritania, which has the title of the world’s last country to abolish slavery. For centuries, members of the black Haratin group were caught in a cycle of servitude, with the slave status being inherited. Reports have also shown the existence of government collusion with slave owners who intimidate servants who break free from their masters. A January landmark ruling from the African Union stated Mauritania wasn’t doing enough to prosecute and jail the perpetrators of slavery. In recent years, serfdom in the continent has attracted global attention after videos showed “slave markets” in Libya where African migrants were being auctioned off in car parks, garages, and as well as public squares. Migration to Libya has also put Nigerian women in the crossfire, with many being sucked into Italy’s dangerous world of sex trafficking. During the World Cup games in Russia, anti-slavery group Alternativa said sex traffickers were also planning to exploit Russia’s lax visa rules for the soccer fanfare to pimp Nigerian women. The study, conducted in collaboration with Walk Free Foundation and the International Labor Organization, also notes how consumers all over the world are getting products that at some stage were touched by the hands of modern-day slaves. This was especially the case with the G20 nations, who have strong laws and systems against servitude, but who collectively import $354 billion worth of at-risk products annually.

"Aaron Mak, Aaron Mak","Japanese policemen work during a rescue operation in the area affected by landslides triggered by the earthquake. A 6.7 magnitude earthquake left at least seven people dead, 30 missing, and more than 150 injured on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Thursday morning. The earthquake further crumpled roads, triggered landslides that knocked over houses, and damaged power systems. First responders, who include more than 4,000 defense force soldiers, have been searching for survivors and working to restore electricity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the defense force may eventually deploy up to 25,000 troops if needed. Much of the destruction occurred in Sapporo, a city with a population of 1.9 million people that serves as the prefectural capital of Hokkaido. Atsuma, a small town of 40 residents located near the epicenter of the earthquake, was also particularly hard hit by the landslides. At least four people died in the town, and rescuers are still digging through soil, rocks, and wreckage to locate survivors. According to the Hokkaido Electric Power company, almost 3 million households lost electricity after a main power station ceased operating. Though some residents had their power back within hours after the quake, it could take more than a week to fully restore service to the island because of damage to the generators. Hokkaido’s Tomari nuclear power plant was also relying on emergency generators for 10 hours, which was a source of anxiety on the island given the meltdown at the Fukushima plant in the aftermath of Japan’s catastrophic tsunami and earthquake in 2011. However, no abnormal radiation had been detected from the Tomari plant. Japan has suffered through a series of natural disasters over the last few months. In July, 200 people died across the country as a result of landslides and flooding. That same month, a heat wave killed 65 people and hospitalized 22,000 others. And on Tuesday, the strongest typhoon to hit the country’s mainland in 25 years killed at least 10 people. Japan is still recovering from the typhoon, and now must address the fallout from the earthquake as well. If you think Slate’s work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

Ben Otto,"PALU, IndonesiaNurdiyah Rasid was performing evening prayers near the beach here when she felt the earthquake hit at dusk on Friday. She stumbled out of the mosque to see water from an adjacent canal being sucked out to sea. Minutes later it surged back, she saidpart of a powerful tsunami that pounded the shore before surging inland. We just ran, Mrs. Rasid said. There were no sirens, no warning. Just the shaking and the panic. Officials have warned they may find thousands more than the 844 people so far confirmed to have been killed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami that followed. The waters swelled to 20 feet in places, growing in size and speed as they rolled up a narrow bay before crashing down on the city of 380,000 people. Rescue workers on Monday raced to pull any survivors from the rubble. Workers had already begun the task of placing bodies side-by-side in a mass grave. A powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday, killing at least 800 people. Authorities fear that the death toll could rise sharply as many are still trapped under debris. Photo: Getty Images Along the coast, debris was strewn across beaches; in some inland areas, entire buildings appeared to be swallowed up when violent shaking turned the soil into something like quicksand, a phenomenon geologists call liquefaction. Families ran for their lives as homes slipped and slid around them. The ground in the Patobo neighborhood of Palu turned to mud and sank 740 houses, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias national disaster agency. It happened on a huge scale, he said. In the Balaroa neighborhood, where 1,147 houses collapsed, the land sank as much as five meters in some places while the quake pushed up other areas by two meters or more, Mr. Nugroho said. 300 miles philippines 300 km BRUNEI MALAYSIA Detail BORNEO KALIMANTAN SUMATRA SULAWESI INDONESIA Jakarta JAVA Indian Ocean Perceived shaking Light Moderate Bangkir Strong Very strong Severe Ambesia 25 miles 25 km Donggala Palu Pasaku SULAWESI Poso Source: USGS Telephone links closer to the epicenter are sporadic at best and roads to some other badly affected areas are impassable. Newly homeless people such as Mrs. Rasid recounted stories of sudden devastation. A man in one seaside neighborhood said there were just minutes to react. What I remember is the ground finally stopping shakingand then you could see surf breaking the distance, he said. It was the color of ash, almost black. As of Monday, authorities had received little word of what happened in the hard-hit Donggala area near the epicenter of the quake, where nearly 300,000 people live. As the scale of the disaster unfolded, the relief effort kicked into a higher gear. Throughout the day, relief planes made their way from nearby cities along with a handful of commercial flights. The United Nations relief agency estimated Monday that 191,000 people on Sulawesi island, where the disaster occurred, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. Indonesias President Joko Widodo authorized the acceptance of international help as neighboring nations such as Malaysia and Australia stood ready to send rescue teams and other aid. The U.S. has offered to send whatever help is needed, as has China. The government is sending as much food and water as possible by plane, and a supply of fuel for generators and lifting equipment to help free survivors was on the way, Thomas Lembong, head of Indonesias Investment Coordinating Board in Jakarta, said on Monday. Time is of the essence. Rescuers believe there could be scores of people still holding out among the rubble of collapsed buildings. As many as 50 could be trapped in the remains of the Hotel Roa Roa, where a 25-year-old woman was found alive on Sunday evening, officials said. Others were still being pulled from the rubble elsewhere, including a 15-year-old girl who was trapped when her family home collapsed. In other parts of the city, a mosque was partially submerged from the tsunami; an 820-foot bridge with bright yellow arches lay in ruins where it had once spanned the Palu River. Residents looted supermarkets and other stores for supplies. At least 50 motorbikes were lined up at one damaged gas station where their owners waited to fill up the tanks. Theyre stealing it, a bystander said. In some areas, police stood guard at banks. After some convenience stores were looted on Sunday, Interior Minister Tjahjo Kumolo said the government would reimburse the owners for losses. At the citys airport, hundreds of families camped out, hoping for a chance to leave on one of the planes bringing aid. Basrin Hamsar said his home was almost entirely destroyed and his wife was hit by falling debris. Her wound was beginning to smell; he brought his family to the airport in the hope of getting flight out. Its totally dark at night and were too scared to stay at home, he said. Other Indonesians were flying back to Palu to search for their loved ones or find out what happened to their homes. Jemmy Langelo had been in Jakarta on business; he booked a flight to Makassar on the southern end of Sulawesi, the island where the disaster struck, and then got a seat on a military Hercules transport plane. His home, several miles from the ocean, largely survived. It is still standing but cracked in places, he said. Indonesia sits on the Ring of Fire, a series of fault lines and volcanoes straddling the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and regularly suffers earthquakes and other national disasters. After the Asian Tsunami of 2004 killed an estimated 228,000 people around the Indian Ocean, most of them in Indonesia, authorities in the region have struggled to maintain an adequate early warning system for tsunamis. The current system, which involves a series of buoys deployed in the open ocean, hasnt been operational since 2012. Some cables have been snapped by passing ships or taken by fisherman for scrap. A recent project to install new censors that provide more warning time stalled this summer when the falling value of Indonesias currency put it beyond the reach of the allocated budget, according to Louise Comfort at the University of Pittsburgh, who was part of the initiative. Even this system might not have provided enough warning for the residents of Palu. The epicenter of the quake was just 50 miles north of the city and they would have had little time to prepare for the resulting tsunami even if the word got out at once. Officials say they sent out a tsunami warning through SMS and social media five minutes after the quake struck. In many places it appeared to have been too lateor simply didnt reach people. Telecommunications links in many areas had already been knocked out by the earthquake, said Mr. Nugroho, the disaster agency spokesman. In some areas, he said, people didnt seem to realize that they need to get away from the coast and seek higher ground when a quake strikes. Many survivors have begun to congregate around government buildings in a part of Palu that appeared to be less badly affected. By Monday, a tent city was taking shape on the lawn of the governors residence as aid workers and other volunteers began to arrive. Some of the displaced residents spoke of seeing President Widodo tour the city the day before. Mrs. Rashid, who escaped the incoming tsunami at the beachfront, showed a large bag of cooking oil, rice, tea and sugar she had received during his visit to her camp. As the numbers swelled, those already there offered newcomers hot bowls of chicken soup. —I-Made Sentana in Jakarta contributed to this article.

The look spread like a meme, and the kind of events and cars seen here are growing more popular here in the States and echoing back out into the rest of the world.

Ars Staff,"reader comments 0 The algorithms that play increasingly central roles in our lives often emanate from Silicon Valley, but the effort to hold them accountable may have another epicenter: New York City. Last week, the New York City Council unanimously passed a bill to tackle algorithmic discrimination—the first measure of its kind in the country. The algorithmic accountability bill, waiting to be signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio, establishes a task force that will study how city agencies use algorithms to make decisions that affect New Yorkers’ lives, and whether any of the systems appear to discriminate against people based on age, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or citizenship status. The task force’s report will also explore how to make these decision-making processes understandable to the public. The bill’s sponsor, Council Member James Vacca, said he was inspired by ProPublica’s investigation into racially biased algorithms used to assess the criminal risk of defendants. “My ambition here is transparency, as well as accountability,” Vacca said. A previous, more sweeping version of the bill had mandated that city agencies publish the source code of all algorithms being used for “targeting services” or “imposing penalties upon persons or policing” and to make them available for “self-testing” by the public. At a hearing at City Hall in October, representatives from the mayor’s office expressed concerns that this mandate would threaten New Yorkers’ privacy and the government’s cybersecurity. The bill was one of two moves the City Council made last week concerning algorithms. On Thursday, the committees on health and public safety held a hearing on the city’s forensic methods, including controversial tools that the chief medical examiner’s office crime lab has used for difficult-to-analyze samples of DNA. As a ProPublica/New York Times investigation detailed in September, an algorithm created by the lab for complex DNA samples has been called into question by scientific experts and former crime lab employees. The software, called the Forensic Statistical Tool, or FST, has never been adopted by any other lab in the country. Council Member Corey Johnson, chair of the health committee, quoted two key findings of our investigation: that FST’s inventors had acknowledged a margin of error of 30 percent for one key input of the program, and that the program could not take into consideration that family members might share DNA. New York City no longer uses the tool for new cases. But officials at the hearing said they saw no need to revisit the thousands of criminal cases that relied on the technique in years past. “Would you be open to reviewing cases in which testing was done on very small mixtures, or do you feel totally confident in all of the methods and science that were used on every case that’s come through your lab?” Johnson asked the officials. “We are totally confident,” answered Dr. Barbara Sampson, the city’s chief medical examiner. The algorithm’s source code was a closely held secret for years until a federal judge granted a motion filed by ProPublica to lift a protective order on it in October. We then published the code. Defense attorneys testified at the hearing, criticizing the medical examiner’s office for what they saw as a dangerous lack of transparency in the development of its DNA tools. Some had joined together to write to the state’s inspector general in September, demanding an investigation into the lab and a review of past cases. The inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, has not yet indicated whether she will pursue it. Meanwhile, the New York State Commission on Forensic Science, which oversees the use of forensic methods in the state’s labs, has discussed the criticisms in executive session meetings. Those sessions are closed to the public and commission members are prohibited from speaking about them. After the hearing, Johnson said he was concerned by the discrepancies between the medical examiner’s testimony and that of advocates and intended to explore it further. “This is a very, very, very important issue, and we have to ensure that methods that are used are scientifically sound, validated in appropriate ways, transparent to the public and to defense counsels, and ensure greater trust in the justice system,” said Johnson. “And I think that is what, hopefully, we can achieve, through asking more questions—and potentially thinking about legislation in the future.” ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

Jesus Diaz,"Funeral homes can be depressing spaces–and not just because of their function. Many of these buildings, of which there are 19,322 in the U.S. alone, are grey, windowless spaces that look like cheap hotel lobbies. The Dutch architectural firm HofmanDujardin, on the other hand, thinks funeral homes and mortuary spaces be uplifting spaces of love, which is why it recently proposed a design that better reflects the way we say goodbye. Founded in 1999, HofmanDujardin’s mission as a firm is to help people to work well and feel good. “In general, all designs we make are human centered,” assistant architect Willem Wopereis says over email. “Our design philosophy–which we call ‘shaping intuition’–is based on intuitive, natural feelings of human beings.” The firm’s conceptual design for a funeral space was spurred by the loss of a dear friend of the studio’s partners, Michiel Hofman and Barbara Dujardin. The experience made the architects “reflect upon the way we say good bye and rethink what a suitable building would look like,” Wopereis explains, “asking themselves how sad moments in our lives can be beautiful at the same time.” [Image: VERO Visuals/courtesy HofmanDujardin] The architects imagined an alternative to the current state of funeral home design, creating a conceptual building organized around three main spaces. The first is called the “Wall of Memories,” which features a floor to ceiling video wall that can be programmed to reflect “the essence” of the deceased. Attendees can send photographs, videos, and digital memories of their loved one to the wall, either before the day of the wake or in real time during the event. The space becomes a collage of images–one last embrace from family and friends, a collective moment to relive his or her life. People can also download the collective memory as a video file, taking a digital memento with them. It’s a reflection of the way digital culture is changing the way we say goodbye; after all, more and more people are making arrangements to take care of their digital lives when they are gone. [Image: VERO Visuals/courtesy HofmanDujardin] The second room is the epicenter of the building, where the coffin is and the actual ceremony takes place. After passing through the Wall of Memories, attendees move into this triangular space, which the architects say “creates intimacy in both small and bigger groups [thanks to] the two curved walls and the ceiling bend inwards to define a passage as the centre for the coffin.” The coffin is framed by a long panoramic window that opens to the natural surroundings. “The shape implies a flow back towards nature, closing the circle of life,” HofmanDujardin says. When the ceremony is done, attendees pass into a third room clad in timber, which serves as an event space with tables and serving areas that facilitate the celebration of the life of the person who passed away. The funeral services industry is a $14.2 billion business in the U.S., and HofmanDujardin hopes that its design could change the way it approaches spaces of mourning. “Hopefully the funeral industry will see this and will reflect upon what their facilities could be like,” Wopereis says. So far, the reaction from people all over the world to the design has been intense and varied; one person told the architects that their design moved her to tears–another wondered “if his family and friends would appreciate such a ‘Instagram-worthy’ send off.” Barring a space funeral, I would much prefer being booted off this planet in this stunning setting than in a funeral home that looks like the lobby of a Best Western.

Richard Gonzales,"Opposition presidential candidate Felix Tshisekedi casting his ballot in Kinshasa. Tshisekedi won the election amid concerns of vote-rigging.
Jerome Delay/AP
The Congolese capital of Kinshasa is reported relatively quiet early Thursday morning as the nation's electoral commission waited until the wee hours to declare opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi the provisional winner of last month's long-delayed presidential election in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
With 7 million votes, or 38 percent, Tshisekedi outpaced another opposition frontrunner, Martin Fayulu, who came in second with more than 6 million votes. The governing coalition's candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary came in third with more than 4 million votes.
""Some observers have suggested that President Joseph Kabila's government sought to make a deal as hopes faded for a win"" for Shadary, the Associated Press reported.
As NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports from Kinshasa that the results could lead to protests and allegations of rigging.
""The influential Catholic Bishop's Conference, which fielded 40,000 observers, says the outcome of the much-anticipated vote is at odds with its tally. Last week the bishops said their observations showed a clear winner although they did not name Martin Fayulu, the other opposition frontrunner as that candidate. So Tshisekedi's apparent victory may become subject to a legal challenge and protests.""
The second-place winner, Fayulu, has not yet indicated whether he will contest the results. Earlier, he said that the results were ""not negotiable"" and that election officials should not ""disguise the truth."" He also made it clear that he was not looking for any deal with Kabila's governing coalition.
The vote, delayed since 2016 and marred by allegations of widespread irregularities, occurred on Dec. 30. The results were originally scheduled to be released on Sunday, Jan 6.
As the central African nation of 80 million people awaited the election results, riot police with water canon were deployed around the electoral commission and Kinshasa's main boulevard in anticipation of possible unrest.
Felix Tshisekedi is the son of Congo's historic opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, who died in 2017.
Term-limited President Joseph Kabila is due to step down after 18 years in power. His term was to have ended in 2016, but he successfully delayed the election until December 2018. Critics charged he used that two-year period to prolong his presidency, violently suppress the opposition and hand-pick his preferred successor.
In face of rising tensions associated with the elections, the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa had issued an alert warning Americans to leave the mineral- and metal-rich country, prone to rebellions and conflict, mainly in the often-troubled east, where the authorities suspended the presidential vote in two opposition strongholds at the epicenter of an Ebola epidemic, citing health concerns about the virus spreading.",Felix Tshisekedi was declared winner of the long-delayed election amid suggestions of vote-rigging. Observers had seen another opposition candidate as leading the field to replace Joseph Kabila.,2019-01-10T04:19:59Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Surprise Winner Of Congolese Election Is An Opposition Leader,https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683830171/surprise-winner-of-congolese-election-is-an-opposition-leader,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/09/ap_19010101049319_wide-69b3fe2e5e42dd11705890df5e68bbece9d93d13.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,epicenter,1
Joe Ciolli,"Calls for an economic recession have occurred with such regularity that, for many investors, the question is not if one will strike, but when. 
Jim Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Leuthold Group, says this is fatalistic thinking that's not necessarily steeped in truth. Sure, multiple red flags have been raised in recent months, but he thinks they've been counterbalanced by forces of strength that have gone overlooked. 
 Paulsen is focused specifically on balance sheet strength for both households and businesses, as well as other signals of confidence. And while he's not naive enough to think that these are the only recession indicators worth watching, their uniform strength is enough to make him question the growing chorus of economic bears. 
 ""Some signs now pointing more prominently to a recession include a calendar-old recovery, a flattish yield curve, and a U.S. leading economic indicator which peaked last September,"" Paulsen said. ""However, private-sector balance sheets, often at the epicenter of most recessions, remain remarkably healthy."" 
Read more: Here's why the next recession could be unlike any the US has ever seen
 But don't take Paulsen's word for it. Let the charts he made do the talking. Below are three that he highlighted in a recent report, each of which makes a separate argument suggesting that ongoing recessionary fears are overblown. 
 1) Balance sheet health 
 The chart below shows measures of balance sheet health for both the household (blue line) and business (red line) sectors. Past recessions are also signified by vertical gray shading. 
 As you can see, recessions have occurred after sharp spikes in these measures. And judging by that historical precedent, the economy doesn't look particularly at-risk right now. 
 Paulsen notes that the household balance sheet ratio has actually strengthened as the economic cycle has aged — the first time that's happened in the post-war era. Further, after an increase around 2015, the business balance sheet ratio has trended sideways ever since. 
Leuthold Group
2) Private sector confidence 
 The chart below has a simple takeaway: Both US consumer and business confidence are still close to post-war highs. This is notable because these measures have historically faded ahead of past recessions. 
 Paulsen highlights the US Consumer Confidence Index specifically. The gauge is at 95.5 right now, and he says it's dropped below 80 before eight of the past nine recessions. Needless to say, it has a long way to go. 
 ""While confidence can change quickly, outsized private sector cautiousness does not yet seem to be hampering the expansion,"" Paulsen said. 
Leuthold Group 
3) A proprietary private sector recession indicator 
 The chart below shows the combination of two proprietary measures tracked by Leuthold — one for households, and the other for businesses. 
 As you can see, the combined gauge is near its highest levels of the current recovery. Because of this, Paulsen stresses that the ongoing expansion is far from old. If anything, he thinks it's ""middle-aged."" 
 ""The Private Sector Recession Indicator in this note has been improving the last few years, it is near its best level of the entire recovery and, if history is any guide, would need to decline substantially before recession risk increases meaningfully,"" Paulsen said. 
 He continued: ""While the end of this economic expansion may be nearing, the healthy state of private sector balance sheets argues that investors may do best by betting against calls for an imminent recession.""

Joe Perticone,"WASHINGTON — As the partial government shutdown has crossed over into the new year, both President Donald Trump and the incoming Democratic House majority are digging in their heels over resolving the lapse in appropriations. 
 The shutdown is days away from eclipsing the 2013 fiasco that became the longest of its kind in United States history. Now this shutdown, being fought over funding for the partial construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, has no end in sight. 
Read more:Trump can't make up his mind between funding the government or shutting it down — forcing senators to turn around from their holiday breaks and head back to DC
 House Democrats plan to pass a package containing two bills when they officially take back the majority on Thursday, which will contain funding for six of the seven agencies still in need. But funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which is at the epicenter of the wall fight, will be given a continuing resolution until February 8 under the Democrats' package. 
 ""It is important to note that these bills contain no new wall funding,"" wrote House Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in a letter to colleagues Tuesday night. 
 ""We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,"" Pelosi added. ""Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the President's third shutdown of his term."" 
 But that plan is still in the expanding category of things Trump will not sign into law, despite the six appropriations bills in the package already being agreed upon by the House and Senate. 
 While negotiations fell off entirely over the holiday break, Trump is summoning the Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers to the White House situation room for a Wednesday afternoon meeting to discuss border security. The meeting will be the first since their tumultuous on-camera discussion before the shutdown began. 
 Democrats are heading into the meeting without much optimism a deal will be struck, suggesting the shutdown will continue, according to one Democratic aide. 
 To make the possibility of the government reopening soon more unlikely, Trump doubled down on his desired number for wall funding at $5.6 billion during his cabinet meeting Wednesday. Trump called the $5.6 billion figure ""such a small number"" and said the shutdown ""could be a long time."" 
 As the shutdown continues to take its toll on everyday services and federal employees who will have to start going without pay, the urgency to find a solution could ramp up. But as it stands, the fight over wall funding has brought a now politically divided Congress to a standstill, moreso than it did when Republicans were in complete control.","The partial government shutdown extended into the new year, with no end in sight.

STEVE LOHR,"MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share. New York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here, Mr. Wilson said. The rise of New Yorks tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the citys work force, whose progress enhanced New Yorks appeal to Amazon. After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition. The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and Technion-the Israel Institute of Technology. The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazons board. The prospect of new competition served as a prod and encouragement to both Columbia University and New York University. Columbia expanded its engineering and computer science programs, and created the Data Science Institute.

Ilan Ben Zion / AP,"(JERUSALEM) — Israel’s transportation minister is pushing ahead with a plan to dig a railway tunnel under Jerusalem’s Old City, passing near sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims — and ending at the Western Wall with a station named after President Donald Trump. Yisrael Katz’s plan, currently in the initial stages, involves constructing two underground stations and excavating over 2 miles (3 kilometers) of tunnel beneath downtown Jerusalem and under the politically sensitive Old City. The project would extend Jerusalem’s soon-to-open high-speed rail line from Tel Aviv to the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray. The route will run close to — but not directly under — the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition holds that Jesus was crucified and buried, and a contested holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Previous excavations by Israel near the holy site — the spiritual epicenter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — have sparked violent Palestinian protests. Because of those sensitivities, the proposal will likely meet with heavy resistance from the Palestinians, neighboring Arab countries and the international community. Katz, a senior Cabinet official who also serves as Israel’s intelligence minister, is a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is seen by many as his likely eventual successor as head of the Likud party. Transportation Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadia said Wednesday the project is estimated to cost more than $700 million and, if approved, would take four years to complete. Katz’s office said the minister advanced the plan in a recent meeting with Israel Railways executives, and has fast-tracked it in the planning committees. Katz said a high-speed rail station would allow visitors to reach “the beating heart of the Jewish people — the Western Wall and the Temple Mount.” He proposed naming the station after Trump “for his brave and historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital” earlier this month. Trump’s announcement has enraged the Palestinians and much of the Muslim world. The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution last week condemning the move, with several traditional American allies breaking with Washington to vote in favor of the motion. Israel captured east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in 1967, and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and a longstanding international consensus holds that the fate of the city should be decided through direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Digging railway tunnels to the Western Wall would also entail excavating in Jerusalem’s Old City, where religious and political sensitivities — as well as layers of archaeological remains from the city’s 3,000-year history — could make for a logistical and legal quagmire. Last year an initiative to convert an already excavated area abutting the Western Wall into an egalitarian Jewish prayer section was hotly contested by Israeli archaeologists, who said such a move would cause irreparable damage to the historic remains of the ancient city. Despite the likely opposition to the project, Ovadia said he expects the plans to be approved in the coming year, barring major complications. The Tel Aviv-Jerusalem high-speed line is expected to open next spring. “There’s no reason why this train won’t be built,” he said. “We already know how to deal with no less difficult opposition.” Katz has previously proposed other ambitious infrastructure projects, including an artificial island off the coast of the Gaza Strip that would serve as an air and seaport for the Palestinian territory, and a railway connecting Israel with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.",Israel's transportation minister is pushing ahead with a plan,2017-12-27T15:13:02Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Jerusalem Train Station Near Western Wall to be Named After Donald Trump,http://time.com/5080221/western-wall-train-station-donald-trump-israel/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-641067732.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1
Eli Meixler / Singapore,"When Jim Taylor moved to Myanmar in 2004, it was ”one of the most isolated and poor countries in the world.” Then known as Burma, the country was terrorized by a repressive military junta and strangled by international sanctions. But Taylor and his wife and business partner Debbie Aung Din were accustomed to working in difficult environments like the Mississippi Delta, Indonesia, and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. “If you look globally, small farms are the epicenter of poverty around the world,” Taylor says. Nowhere is that truer than in Myanmar, where 70% of the population relies on agriculture and 84% of rural households lack electricity. Taylor and Aung Din founded Proximity Designs, a social enterprise focused on Myanmar’s 35 million farmers. With a team of designers, engineers, agronomists and ethnographers, Proximity makes practical, affordable tools like foot-powered water pumps and drip-irrigation systems that help farmers’ increase crop yields and incomes. All but one of the tools costs less than $40. Proximity has sold tools to over half a million families in 10,000 villages, boosting their livelihoods by, it says, a total of $263 million. The company now offers training and education on seeds, soil, and disease and low interest-rate loans to farmers, most of whom don’t have bank accounts. Meanwhile, the country’s political transition and economic liberalization is “uncorking everything,” Taylor says, giving farmers access for the first time to new technology and information. “Farmers suddenly look around at Asia, they see farmers in India, in Thailand, in Vietnam and China and they go, ‘Wow, we’re really behind.’ They’re entrepreneurial, they’re enterprising, they’re generally not afraid of technology or new ways of doing things.” Taylor spoke with TIME at the Fortune, TIME, and Wallpaper* Brainstorm Design conference in Singapore. Why does Proximity Designs focus on small-plot farmers? We had been looking at rural poverty for a long time, and saw it was a very neglected sector. It was under-served by the private sector, government, and the aid sector. We also understood that if you’re going to tackle poverty in Myanmar, the epicenter is the small-farm family. It’s still largely an agrarian economy; really, really low levels of productivity, low access to any kind of improved technology amd seeds, so it was an area that was really ripe for improvement. Proximity treats farmers like clients, rather than recipients of charity. What does that mean in practice, and why is it important? It was certainly a new idea back in 2004; now it’s become accepted wisdom in aid circles. The aid industry has a huge disconnect between providing things and getting any feedback. If you hand out something, great. If it’s worthless, you go, okay, well there’s really no consequences. But in a business approach, you’re treating people like customers, you’re accountable to making things that people find valuable. I’ve had people angry with me, because [a product] broke prematurely, or it didn’t function. It’s just a much more respectful, natural way that people relate. And I think for the organization it has dramatic consequences. If I give you choice, I’m showing respect for you, and showing you’re a person who has your own dignity. How has your approach changed since 2004? After Cyclone Nargis [which killed an estimated 130,000 people and flooded 3.2 million acres in 2008], we began to really see the total lack of [government response] to farmers’ needs. They put a lot of emphasis on that first rice crop. And then a brown planthopper disease came in and destroyed thousands of acres. And it was the result of farmers seeing an insect and then panicking and applying pesticides. Season after season, we began to see all these other pest and disease problems, and we realized farmers were really didn’t have access to information. They were very keen for it, but had been isolated for so long. So we saw an opportunity there to provide agronomy services, and that’s now in our fifth year. A 2016 report from NGO Germanwatch named Myanmar one of the three more vulnerable countries in the world to extreme weather. What can be done to address the risk of climate change in Myanmar, or in other rural, agrarian regions? Farmers really are the front line of shifting [weather] patterns. When farmers are looking at a late monsoon or an early monsoon, or an elongated one, those have a dramatic effect on crops. In the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, we have all this fresh water that comes down from the Ayeyarwaddy [River], and then as the dry season gets longer, more seawater comes in. So we developed a technique, rather than a saltwater tolerant variety, a short-duration rice. It can just dramatically change people’s incomes if they can get that short, second crop in. Just as we see temperature changes, and different pest and disease outbreaks, [we’re] helping [farmers] cope with that, with better seeds that are more drought-tolerant. A lot of environmental effects are just the result of poor infrastructure. And in Myanmar, one of the biggest constraints on agriculture is just the lack of investment in rural areas for decades. It’s just 40 years of neglect. What is the biggest misconception about designing for social impact? A farmer in Kansas and a farmer in Myanmar really aren’t that different. They’re really very conscious of risks, they’re interested in new technology if it’s practical and affordable. You talk to any family: they want to send their kids to school, they want their kids to go to university. So these small little tools and devices and services can really help them do that. People make those connections all the time: I want something beautiful on my farm, and I know it’s going to help me stabilize my income, and therefore my kid is going to be able to go to college. Do you think of your business as a “social-enterprise”? I think many businesses are moving towards social impact. We’re able to attract really high-quality people in Myanmar because they want to work for an organization where they can make a mark, a difference. I’m comfortable being labeled a social business, but this is really a trend. If we have a conversation in 10 years, this demarcation of social business and regular business will be less and less. When you look at what motivates us, we’re trying to address a poorly served market. Many successful businesses do that.",The former strategy analyst has helped over half a million families in thousands of villages get a better life,2018-04-02T02:57:08Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","‘If I Give You Choice, I’m Showing Respect’: How This Man Uses Design to Help the World’s Poorest Farmers",http://time.com/5216625/jim-taylor-proximity-design-interview-myanmar-poverty/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/myanmarmoney-kalaw-misc-jan-0237-version-3.jpeg?quality=85,time,Time,epicenter,1

Bill Desowitz,"In “American Crime Story’s” second season, creator Ryan Murphy explored the social significance of the murder of legendary fashion designer Gianni Versace (Édgar Ramírez) by spree-killer Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss) outside his Miami mansion in 1997. In particular, Murphy contrasts the high and low worlds of Versace and Cunanan in Miami, the difficulty of coming out of the closet in the ’90s, and the culture’s underlying homophobia. Visually, it was a tour-de-force for production designer Judy Becker (“Feud: Bette and Joan”) and costume designer Lou Eyrich (a three-time Emmy winner for “American Horror Story”). And Miami’s South Beach became the visual epicenter. “It’s about the clash between the high Versace world and the low Cunanan world,” Becker said. “But then within Cunanan’s world there were the contrasts of being taken care of by sugar daddies and being on his own.” Jeff Daly/FX Read More: ‘The Assassination of Gianni Versace’ Writer On Why Equality Means More Complicated Gay Villains The clothes, too, reflected the difference between Versace, who transformed fashion into a glam party world, and Cunanan, who aspired to be a part of that fantasy. “Versace liked to be stylish but comfortable, and Andrew was a chameleon: He dressed the part to fit into the older gentleman’s world,” said Eyrich. Miami: Black and Gold Meets Pink The Versace mansion (Casa Casuarina) has since become a boutique hotel, but, fortunately, the production was allowed access. The opening of the first episode (“The Man Who Would Be Vogue”) was completely shot in the Versace mansion, including the interior, the pool area, and the first courtyard. The interior design was intricate and extravagant, with two rooms made out of seashells. Since much of the original furniture was sold, the art department commissioned Italian upholsterers to recreate the original, Versace-designed, furniture fabric, accentuating black and gold. “His ambition and authenticity were important to Ryan,” Becker said. “Versace was rich and successful so the sets showed the success, taste, and his personality. He was very flamboyant, but we didn’t go crazy with the palette. We used a lot of tone on tone, whereas Andrew’s sugar daddies lived in monochromatic homes, and when he was alone, Andrew lived in a world of beige.” “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” Ray Mickshaw/FX In the second episode (“Manhunt”), Becker built two important sets in LA for the Miami locations: the interior of the grungy Normandy Plaza Hotel, where Andrew stayed, and a more upscale hotel, where he worked as a prostitute. Both emphasized different shades of pink, at Ryan’s request. “It’s a color you see in Miami,” she said. “It’s indicative of the sunsets, and it represents the pink triangle that gay men had to wear in concentration camps. “The Normandy had cracking on the walls and it represented a place where Andrew had no power and was alone and poor. Ryan kept telling me to add more cracks. It really showed the decay. The other hotel had pink neon and the Memphis look [with bold colors], and was a place where Andrew held power.” High and Low Fashion Statements Without the cooperation of the Versace fashion house, costume designers Eyrich and Allison Leach were left to their own creative devices, so they turned to online resellers to purchase authentic Versace pieces while making garments for the principal actors. Two Versace standouts included the pink robe that he wore in the beginning, and the iconic black leather bondage dress worn by his sister, Donatella (Penélope Cruz ). In fact, Eyrich’s favorite outfit for Versace was a leather shirt and pants that she recreated from one of his research books. “It really showed the beauty of his work,” she said. But the bondage dress was a difficult construction challenge. “Trying to figure out how he draped that had all of us in the department full of awe and respect for Versace and his meticulous hand,” she added “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” Jeff Daly/FX However, when it came to Cunanan, there was obviously a lot more artistic license in dressing the 27-year-old hustler, who relied on relationships with wealthy older men to achieve the appearance of success and affluence. Eyrich and Leach mainly used descriptions from Maureen Orth’s book, “Vulgar Favors,” from which the FX series was adapted. But when Cunanan fled to Miami, desperate and embittered, he planned the murder of Versace with few resources. “He has very little clothes left after his killing spree and he’s using drugs and losing weight,” said Eyrich. “We back track and tell his story, dressing him very sporty and conservative or preppy to fit in.” “It was more about not letting him stand out,” added Eyrich. “Dressing him up in a linen sport coat with the perfect jeans and a loafer for when he’s at the height of the high life, to finding a place when he’s destitute and his clothes are all too big on him.” Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

"USA TODAY, Brett Molina, USA TODAY","Jowan Osterlund from Biohax Sweden, holds a small microchip implant, similar to those implanted into workers at the Epicenter digital innovation business center (Photo: James Brooks, AP) Groups in the U.K. representing businesses and workers are questioning plans published in a report Sunday claiming companies were preparing to microchip employees. According to The Telegraph, a Swedish company called Biohax said it was in talks with multiple British legal and financial companies to provide human chip implants to employees for security. ""These companies have sensitive documents they are dealing with,"" said Jowan Österlund, the founder of Biohax in an interview with The Telegraph. ""(The chips) would allow them to set restrictions for whoever."" In a statement emailed to USA TODAY, the Confederation of British Industry, which represents more than 190,000 businesses in the U.K., questioned the need for microchipping workers. ""Firms should be concentrating on rather more immediate priorities and focusing on engaging their employees,"" said the organization. Frances O'Grady, General Security for the Trades Union Congress, said the practice would give companies more power and control over employees. ""We know workers are already concerned that some employers are using tech to control and micromanage, whittling away their staffs right to privacy,"" O'Grady said. The business of human chip implants first generated buzz in July 2017, after a Wisconsin company said it would offer employees microchip implants to scan into the building or buy food at work. The chip, which is about the size of a grain of rice, uses near-field communication readable at a compatible terminal, similar to how a card reader might work. Biohax said the devices have been tested for decades and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. The chips have already been in use by residents in Sweden, the home country of Biohax.

Megan Molteni,"Delaney Van Riper was exhausted. It was the summer of 2017 and shed spent the previous day touring UC Santa Cruzs cliffside campus, getting her student paperwork in order, and meeting some of her 4,000 fellow incoming Slugs. Now, dressed head-to-toe in sweats, she was ready to nap in the backseat for the ride to her familys home three hours away in Sacramento. But first, she had to stop at a glass and granite building in San Franciscos Mission Bay, roll up her sleeve, and give some scientists shed just met a few tubes of blood from the crook of her arm. While Van Riper spent the next year navigating new roommates and freshman poetry classes, researchers at the Gladstone Institutes were busy reprogramming her blood cells into stem cells and then neurons, growing them in incubators by the million, and sending in Crispr systems to try to cut out a troublesome mutation lurking on the short arm of her longest chromosome. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr Van Riper, now 19 and a sophomore literature major, was born with a rare genetic disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, or CMT, which is slowly eroding her nerve cells ability to ping messages back and forth between her brain and her muscles. Doing things with her hands and feet, like walking and holding a pencil, has been growing progressively harder. But last year she became one of a handful of patients whose cells are undergoing experimental Crispr procedures at the Gladstone that may one day be used to rid them of their genetically-determined disabilities. In September, UC Berkeley biochemist and Crispr pioneer Jennifer Doudna announced she was opening up a lab across the Bay to establish the epicenter of a whole new field of medicine: genome surgery. As an ever-increasing crop of Crispr drug companies collect capital and race toward clinical trials, Doudna saw an opportunity for someone had to take an expanded, more inclusive view. She found a home for it at the Gladstone, a nonprofit biomedical research center with hundreds of scientists and an affiliation with UC San Francisco and its clinical programs. What she envisions is the development of procedures closer to how surgeons slice out malignant tumor tissues with scalpels today. Except tomorrows genome surgeons will use Crisprs molecular scissor function to remove or replace faulty genescuring diseases at their genetic source code. Were focused on whats going to be best for patients in the long run, not simply what product can we quickly bring to market, says Doudna. Though also the co-founder of a number of Crispr-based medical ventures, she worries that pressures for them to quickly turn a profit will leave behind many rare genetic diseases, each caused by a constellation of unique mutations that all require custom-built tools to fix them. And then theres the question of the affordability of the treatments that do make it to market. Lowering the price tag for patients and making Crispr a sustainable technology is something more readily sorted out in a nonprofit setting, says Doudna. We need to step back and figure out how to ensure in the future that this technology is not something only available to the 0.1 percent. Cost isnt the only challenge. Theres also the problem of getting Crispr into the right cells, and into enough of those cells to make a difference. You can teach cells to build Crispr systems themselves, with instructions ferried in by innocuous viruses, but that approach makes it harder to control Crisprs cutting action. You can coax Crispr into the cell directly by coating the protein complex itself in fat particles, but its not very efficient and its hard to direct. How will physicians deliver gene editors to tissues deep inside the human body, like the heart, or the brain? Then there are even more fundamental unknowns associated with developing an entirely new medical modality. Whats the right dose? Whats the right way to calculate risks and benefits for patients? What data do you have to collect to know its safe and effective? Doudna and her collaborators at the Gladstone hope to answer these big questions over the next five to ten years. Their efforts are perhaps the most concentrated push in a national effort to create the tools and rules necessary for doctors to widely adopt genome editing as part of standard care for the 25 million Americans estimated to be living with one of 6,000 diseases caused by a glitch in their DNA. In January, the National Institutes of Health committed $190 million over the next six years to speed Crispr into the clinic. So far, it has awarded grants to a consortium of 17 academic research institutions, including the Gladstone, and one biotechnology company to help them assemble and make public a Crispr toolkit. Among other things, it will contain better delivery techniques as well as safer, more precise genome editors, along with cell-tracking technologies to check on the results after surgery. Its components are intended, in part, to help the Food and Drug Administration chart a smooth regulatory path for Crispr, so that it gets treated like the hybrid technology it ispart device (molecular scalpel), part drug (bacterial protein). Before this gets too far out in front of us, were trying to help set some standards around genome editing, says Todd McDevitt, a senior investigator at the Gladstone who is assessing the safety of Crispr in human cells and tissues. Unlike other kinds of drugs that you can test in model organisms, its not possible to edit human genomes inside a mouse or a rat. Before doctors can start shooting Crispr into patients, scientists like McDevitt have to engineer lifelike human microtissues in which to test it first. Inside McDevitts lab, one of his postdocs pulls out a plate where a few flesh-colored dots the size of a felt-tip pen float in a bath of hot-pink media. She slips it under an inverted fluorescence microscope. Immediately, two dark blobs fill the monitor nearby. A shock of green light shivers across them. A few seconds later it happens again. Each organoid is about a year-old, comprised of nearly 100,000 beating human heart cells. Encoded in their DNA is a green fluorescent protein that only lights up in the presence of calcium. Every green flash on the screen represents a microscopic heart ball contraction, and serves as a visual cue to any improvements (or damage) caused by Crispr. Besides heart organoids, McDevitts lab is growing sheets of retinas and brain balls grown from cells donated by patients like Van Riper. Besides CMT, the Gladstone is also focusing its initial efforts on two other genetic disordersa heart condition called cardiomyopathy and BEST disease, which causes progressive blindness. Over the next three years, as other researchers in the building design new and better Crispr systems, theyll send them to McDevitt. Then, his team will try them out on their 3D organoids, each one carrying the mutational signature of the person whose body it came from. Theyll measure both the intended and the unintended consequences. The goal is to one day launch a clinical trial where patients like Van Riper receive Crispr genome surgery using constructs that have already shown success in their own cells. Were trying to perfect a craft, says Bruce Conklin, a physician and senior investigator at the Gladstone. But the idea is to test lots of hypotheses with one patient so that the next person is much faster. Doudna credits Conklin, a long-time collaborator, with coining the term genome surgery. Together they envision a future where a patient with CMT comes into a hospital, gets his or her genome sequenced, and the doctor says, Okay, based on your mutations youre a candidate for Crispr A and Crispr B, which have all been FDA-approved for that disease, along with Crispr C, D, E, F, and G. Together that suite of genome editors would cover every one of the thousand different mutations that all cause CMT. In a system like that, we might just give the Crispr systems away for free, says Conklin. And then its just a procedure like an organ transplant. Nobodys getting paid for an organ. But before that can happen, Doudna and Conklin will have to raise a significant amount of money to fund expensive clinical trials. And patients will have to volunteer to see if the Crispr that cures their cells in a dish and in ball-form can do the same thing inside their bodies. For Van Riper, that could potentially happen by the time she finishes college. She says shes a little bit scared for when that day comes, if it ever does. But somebody has to do it, right? she says. I wouldnt participate if I wasnt willing to see it all the way through to the end.

Sarah Kessler,"On the threshold of the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), the world’s epicenter for complexity science, a plaque in Greek characters shares Plato’s admonishment: “Let no man ignorant of geometry enter here.” While it’s far more impressive in Ancient Greek, few visitors to SFI can read it. Eventually the same will be true of computer code. It will become the Ancient Greek of the late 21st century. STEM has become a ubiquitous call-to-action in response to technological change, and learning to code in particular is often positioned as a panacea. The Wall Street Journal recently suggested that coding bootcamps can “rapidly retrain American workers for the 21st century.” And Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that learning to code will eventually be more important than studying English as a second language. I agree that coding skills are important. Groups such as Girls Who Code bring coding to young women, and school systems worldwide have added coding to their curriculums. Bravo! But we’re over-stating the benefits. Though it’s certainly far better to know a computer language than not, remaining relevant will be a moving target as computer languages and programming environments arise, evolve, and in some cases die. A singular focus on “learning to code” can impede attention to the much more important skill of understanding how technology works, and the opportunities and risks within systems and society. Coding As Ancient Greek From the Renaissance onward, knowing Ancient Greek—not to be confused with Modern Greek—was essential to being considered part of the truly educated elite. This Greek bias persisted in academic circles into the early 20th Century, long after the language was necessary for all but specialists. It is still enlightening and impressive to understand Ancient Greek, but it’s not terribly useful. The same will over time happen to coding. Evidence suggests that coding will increasingly be implemented, even planned, by AI systems. This is part of a natural progression from computer-friendly to human-friendly systems. Consider how the end user’s experience has evolved. The graphical user interface, developed at XEROX PARC in the 1970s and brought to market with the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s, overtook clunky, technical text-based interfaces with a much more intuitive approach. While operating a computer once required specific technical knowledge, today it requires almost none. Programming languages and environments have reflected the same trend. Since their genesis mid-last century, programming platforms have become more abstracted from the underlying 1s and 0s. For instance, programming in Ruby, developed in the 1990s, is a far cry from composing in COBOL, which rose to prominence in the 1960s. The author of Ruby, Yukihiro Matsumoto, commented about his objective, “I really wanted a genuine … easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn’t find one. So I decided to make it.” Though COBOL was partly an attempt to make programming more “English-like,” Ruby and other languages developed since have brought coding languages closer to natural human communication. Extrapolate this trend and you can imagine instructing a computational system in your native tongue (really a broader, messy form of human “code”). Already we have seen companies make computational capabilities more accessible to non-specialists. Recent MIT spinoff pienso, for instance, seeks to make “AI for All.” To empower people with no data science background to create and train their own machine learning models. In this vision, domain expertise becomes more important than programming savvy. The need for humans to code will gradually disappear for all but the most specialized situations. Platforms will enable humans to describe in natural spoken or written language what they’d like computers to accomplish. The coding will occur behind the computational scenes. We won’t code so much as direct and request. Ultimately, coding isn’t the point. The objective is to define and communicate what we want computational systems to do. Discovering And Defining Problems To Solve Beyond coding, humans will identify, define and prioritize problems for computers to solve. Over the coming decades, though, computational systems will become capable of defining problems of value and generating solutions with only limited human engagement. While we’ll shift toward human-friendly approaches, understanding how computational systems work and what possibilities and risks they pose will remain essential. But so will having broad and deep exposure across disciplines and ways of thinking. When technology can increasingly do anything, the question becomes, what should we do and why? We humans cannot be sufficiently equipped for the future without exposure to the social sciences, humanities and the arts. Well-functioning civil society depends on it. On the eve of World War II, Winston Churchill cautioned, “Ill fares the race which fails to salute the arts with the reverence and delight which are their due.” While essential, STEM as work skills (as opposed to research disciplines) harbor a Trojan Horse. The STEM capabilities required to create technology will one day generate technologies that accomplish STEM far better than human beings. If we’re too focused on STEM skills, we’ll eventually STEM ourselves out of work. While I admit my intellectual inferiority to anyone who can read Plato in his native language, this doesn’t matter much beyond my pride. My daughters will surely learn to code. More importantly, we’ll ensure they understand how computational systems operate and the concomitant opportunities and risks. And they’ll learn Geometry so they can visit the great people at SFI.
