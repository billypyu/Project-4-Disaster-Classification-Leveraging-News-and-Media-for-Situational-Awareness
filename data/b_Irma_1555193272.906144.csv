The category five storm also wreaked havoc on the habitat of the tiny island's world-famous frigatebird colony. Codrington Lagoon is said to be the second-largest nesting area outside the Galapagos and has attracted tourists for decades. Image copyright Courtesy of Antigua &amp; Barbuda Tourism Authority Image caption Tourists and bird watchers were drawn to the lagoon because of its rich birdlife But most of the erstwhile 10,000-strong frigatebird population disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the disaster when the catastrophic winds destroyed the mangroves in which they nest and breed. The aptly named magnificent frigatebirds are famed for their colossal 7ft (2.1m) wingspan and the males' spectacular show of flirting by puffing out their throats into a bright red balloon during mating season. Frigatebirds: Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Earned the nickname ""man o' war birds"" due to their habit of aggressively stealing food from other birds Females select mates and form monogamous pairs for the duration of the breeding season Females lay just one egg, every other year Juvenile frigatebirds stay with the mother for up to two years Graceful in flight, they are clumsy on land because of their short legs and small feet They have called this pristine, peaceful area on Antigua's sister island home for as long as residents can remember. Happily, the birds have started to return and even build nests in the fragile, decaying stumps of the once luscious trees. Numbers are now set to rise further thanks to an imminent mangrove restoration project being funded by a team of four transatlantic rowers who are also ardent local environmentalists. Tough challenge In January, Team Antigua completed the gruelling 3,000-mile (4,800km) Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge race from the Canary Islands to Antigua in just 30 days, taking second place. John Watt, Scott Potter, Nico Psihoyos and Eli Fuller raised more than $150,000 (£112,000) towards their goal of creating a marine park in Antigua. Image copyright Courtesy of Atlantic Campaigns Image caption Team Antigua rowed 3,000 miles from the Canary Island of La Gomera to Antigua ""We decided to give a third of the money to Barbuda and we were keen for it to be an environmental project,"" Mr Fuller explains. ""The bird sanctuary is critically important for Codrington economically. And ecologically, you won't find many places as crucial as Barbuda. It's not just birds - it's a vital nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill turtles too."" The sanctuary has long been a significant source of revenue for Barbudans, several of whom earn a living as tour guides. ""Some people do as many as three trips a day in high season,"" says part-time guide Devon Warner. 'Great relief' Seeing the area stripped of vegetation and devoid of birds in the first days after the storm was ""horrifying"", park manager Kelly Burton tells the BBC. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Before Hurricane Irma hit, the mangroves were healthy and full of frigatebirds Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption After Irma, the picture was bleak ""The first thing going through my mind was, would they ever come back?"" Mr Burton recalls. ""Seeing the birds return and nest was a great relief. Many have chicks right now so they will be here at least another year or two. The restoration will be a huge help."" Many of the birds live year round in Barbuda. Others travel between the Caribbean and the Galapagos and there are a handful of other known nesting sites in the region, Mr Burton says. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Frigatebirds nest in the mangroves so restoring them is key ""But the healthiest place is Barbuda. Scientists once took blood samples from the birds to see why ours were so healthy. They think it's due to the low levels of mercury in the fish they eat."" The non-profit Waitt Institute will oversee the mangrove project as part of its marine conservation partnership with the Barbuda Council, known as Blue Halo Barbuda. The process involves collecting several thousand seeds - or propagules - from coastal areas and planting them in a new purpose-built nursery, says science and field manager Andy Estep. ""They will soak in little pots for six months to a year before being planted at the sanctuary,"" he explains. 'Full of life' The $50,000 donated by the rowers will be spent on equipment and supplies for the nursery and a salary for its manager, plus travel expenses for visiting experts from the University of the West Indies. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption The frigatebirds on Barbuda are particularly healthy, experts say Barbudans will be trained to run the nursery and grow propagules for future programmes. Preliminary assessments to gauge the quality of the water in the lagoon, along with salinity, acidity and oxygen levels to help predict how well the young mangroves will thrive, are now poised to begin. ""More than half of the tree mass was lost to Irma,"" Mr Estep continues. ""If we can return it to its former state, that would be fantastic. It's a beautiful place normally and so full of life as one of the two biggest reproductive hotspots for frigatebirds."" Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Environmentalists were worried the birds would not return Nine months after the storm ripped Barbuda apart, causing damage estimated at $220m, islanders are battling on to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Just like the birds, Barbudans too are slowly coming home. Around 500 of the former 1,800 residents have so far returned from Antigua to rebuild homes and businesses. Reviving the touristic offerings will be key, argues Mr Burton. ""The frigates are also our national bird and something unique to Barbuda. They're been part of the landscape forever,"" he says. ""They choose to make this place their home; it's up to us, as stewards of the land, to look after it for them.""",Frigatebirds almost disappeared from Barbuda after Hurricane Irma hit but now they are back.,2018-06-25T00:35:04Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Barbuda sees a comeback of national bird after Hurricane Irma,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-44547090,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13472/production/_102126987_f31af90f-515e-4bfc-bd28-a6733fc82fdf.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Irma,1
Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

Jennings Brown,"No one should ever screw around on a public alert system. But considering it’s been a bad year for warning systems—from the Hawaii false emergency alert accidentally informing the public of an incoming missile that didn’t exist to the National Weather Service’s false tsunami warning to the Department of Justice’s Amber Alert site issues that redirected visitors to porn sites —now is an especially bad time for someone to be screwing around on an alert system. But that may have been what happened when the City of Lake Worth, Florida, sent out a “zombie alert” during a power outage around 1:45am Sunday. “There are now far less than seven-thousand-three-hundred-eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity,” the alert states. (Get it? There are fewer customers because many are zombies now!) The message said the alert was for “residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.” Since Terminus is a location in The Walking Dead, it seems likely this message was sent out as a joke or was the result of a hack. The city public information officer, Ben Kerr, told Gizmodo this has been a reoccurring issue. “We first became aware of the zombie messages during Hurricane Irma,” Kerr told Gizmodo. He doesn’t know when the culprit got into the system and changed the messages, but the city noticed during the August 2017 hurricane because many (zombie-tainted) outage alerts were going out. At the time, the city was able to attend to the message issues before the public noticed. Lake Worth’s electric utility system is set up to send out automatic alerts when there’s an outage. The system has thousands of pre-programmed messages, Kerr explained. But it seems that at some point someone went through and messed with some of the messages to turn them into zombie jokes. “The actual power systems were not in any way compromised. This is a separate messaging system that at some point has been compromised,” Kerr said. “They just added a zombie fantasy.” Kerr says the city has is investigating the prank, and has finally scrubbed all the zombie messages from the system. “Hopefully the next time there is a zombie invasion alert,” Kerr said, “it will be a real zombie invasion.” [ Palm Beach Post / Lake Worth Live ]",No one should ever screw around on a public alert system.

A.J. GOLDMANN,"Anne Tismer’s neurotic State Secretary is the closest thing the show has to a Dr. Strangelove of its own. Instead of fantasizing about sexual utopias in nuclear bunkers, though, she keeps interrupting (amusingly at first, and then tiresomely) with lengthy monologues about matriarchal orders in the animal kingdom, specifically among the bonobos. The French playwright Jean Genet envisioned an entirely different kind of matriarchy in his nightmarish 1956 work, “ The Balcony,” which has been given a furious and intimate production by the Croatian director Ivica Buljan on the smallest of the Residenztheater Munich’s three stages. The drama unfolds in a brothel in an unnamed city while a bloody revolution rages outside. This “house of illusions,” as Genet referred to it, is the dominion of Madame Irma, who caters to the whims of the Judge, the Bishop, the General and the Chief of Police, pillars of society who frequent her rooms to get their kicks. (It is strongly suggested that Irma’s clientele are ordinary working men living out role-playing fantasies, but, like so much else in this complex play, that’s open to interpretation.) The convulsions of the city under siege are never far from the lurid goings-on in the world of the bordello, where Irma wields absolute power, acting as a sort of stage manager of the male desires she caters to. In the play’s second half, Irma is propped up as a queen by the revolutionary government, and her lecherous clients are propelled into actual positions of power. Genet was famously dissatisfied with virtually every performance he saw of “The Balcony.” I would like to think that he would have approved of Mr. Buljan’s uncompromising staging, even if Aleksander Denic’s set, made of refrigerators and freezers (whose arrangement, unsubtly, resembles a swastika), is a far cry from the chandelier-filled sumptuousness that Genet envisioned.",Three plays in Germany present very different ideas about women in roles of authority.,2018-05-24T04:43:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Imagining a World Ruled by Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/arts/what-if-women-ruled-the-world-volksbuehne.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/arts/26berlintheater01/26berlintheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1

Rayne Ellis,"The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences. Hurricanes Irma and Maria — some of the most destructive in Caribbean history — may have forced rapid evolutionary change in a native population of small-bodied anole lizards (Anolis scriptus), researchers in the West Indies say. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down. Here's why that's very bad news for everyone. According to a new study about the lizards released in Nature this week, much of the surviving population of lizards after the hurricanes have larger toe pads, longer forelimbs, and shorter hind limbs than the average anole. Still of lizard clinging to an experimental perch in hurricane-force winds. Wind speed meter is displaying in miles per hour.Credit: Colin Donihue Image: Colin donihue Those long forelimbs and toe pads would have allowed these anoles to cling to surfaces during gale-force winds brought by the hurricanes. Effectively, this means that the hurricanes forced natural selection in real-time, the scientists suggest. “Day in and day out, natural selection favors those lizards who can run around branches, find food, and find mates,” lead author of the study Colin Donihue said in an interview. “It’s only in these atypical instances like hurricanes that we would be able to see a shift away from historical selection.” With the frequency and intensity of hurricanes ramping up, species within affected ecosystems are being forced to adapt to extreme conditions. It's even possible that certain adaptations might aid survival chances in one instance, and hurt them in another, Martha Muñoz, an evolutionary biologist not affiliated with the study, said. ""One trait can enable survivorship in a storm, like shorter hind limbs, but on a daily basis longer hind limbs will help these animals escape predation because it helps them run faster,"" Muñoz said. But it would take an entirely different study to determine how this selection affects the future of the species, and findings like this are rare. In fact, the data from Donihue and colleagues was due to a coincidence. They had just completed a survey of the lizard population immediately before the hurricanes swept through the island. After the hurricanes, they recognized that they had a unique opportunity, and decided to return. The hurricanes key to their research, Irma and Maria, have gone down as two of the worst natural disasters to affect the Caribbean — where it's possible that almost 5,000 people have lost their lives. And a year later, some places affected, like Puerto Rico and Dominica, still don't have power. The literature on the impact of extreme weather events on localized animal populations is a relatively scarce, but burgeoning field due to increased extreme weather. A study published in 2017 found that a polar vortex that hit the Southeast in 2014 drove selection in a population of green anole lizard. The NOAA's GOES-East satellite captured the 2014 polar vortex hovering over the United State's southeast. Image: NASA The researchers behind that study were able to survey the population of lizards before and after the weather event, and found that the surviving population of lizards had many of the genetic qualities in northern populations of the same species. For example, the surviving lizards had an abnormally high tolerance for cold weather in that region. Aside from these two studies, there isn’t much known about how fast-acting extreme weather events change animal populations on a large scale. But with extreme weather events becoming more and more common as human-caused climate change continues, it’s likely that the common agents of natural selection will shift toward those which influence survival during these catastrophes. “The key to this study is understanding that natural selection is on-going and is constantly in the background,” Donihue said The next step? Muñoz suggests going back to the island a year later and measuring the new generation of lizards to see if this natural selection has truly translated into evolution.",The extreme winds from last year's destructive hurricane season seems to have come with some unexpected consequences.

JASON FARAGO,"Among younger talents, I was impressed by a pair of delicate but unsettling paintings on rice paper by the Iranian artist Shahpour Pouyan, at the booth of the Galerie Nathalie Obadia, based in both Paris and Brussels. Mr. Pouyan has reproduced centuries-old Persian miniatures that depicted Muhammad and other religious figures — Central Asian artists, unlike their Arab counterparts, frequently portrayed the prophet in art — but has excised the figures to leave only gold arches, blue backdrops and flowing calligraphy. The erasure is at once a tribute to the less heralded constituent elements of Persian painting and fearsome metaphor for recent attacks on religious representation, from the museums of Baghdad to the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo. But I often find Art Basel Miami Beach more valuable for historical surprises. Galeria Jaqueline Martins, one of São Paulo’s sharpest, has a solo presentation of the Brazilian feminist and visual artist Letícia Parente (1930-1991), who grafted together street plans of Salvador, Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro into personal memory maps, or who filmed herself applying makeup in the bathroom while her mouth and eyes were taped shut. (Parente is also a standout of “Radical Women,” the history-rewriting showcase of female Latin American artists up now at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and coming to the Brooklyn Museum in April.) And the can’t-miss booth of this fair comes from a gallery that, I’m embarrassed to say, I’d never heard of before: Applicat-Prazan, a decades-old Parisian space participating in Art Basel Miami Beach for the first time. This specialist in midcentury European painting has arrived with a dozen bracing works by figures too little known in the United States, including Otto Freundlich, Nicolas de Staël and Hans Hartung. A seething 1960 abstraction by Karel Appel features thickly applied splashes of white and brown paint, whose seeming carelessness belies clear care. In Jean Hélion’s “Trois Nus et le Gisant” (“Three Nudes and Reclining Man”), a disquieting painting from 1950, three women — the Fates, or just an artist’s models? — sit in judgment over a splayed young man, perhaps in postcoital slumber, perhaps murdered.

The Spanish firm Aranguren &amp; Gallegos Arquitecto has fitted the three-story building with a facade of shiny metal panels and cutout triangular windows: very un-Deco, very new Miami. Commendably, the institute has free admission, though in these initial days, it is encouraging visitors to book time slots online. Alex Gartenfeld, its deputy director and an astute curator who has stuck with the museum through the last years’ ructions, has organized its inaugural show: “The Everywhere Studio,” a ramble through recent art and economic history that examines how artists’ work spaces have shaped their production. The isolation of the studio in art from the 1960s and ’70s — including Bruce Nauman’s and Hanne Darboven’s Conceptual documentations of everyday life in the studio, and an excellent self-portrait at work by Jörg Immendorff — feels very different from Neïl Beloufa’s and Yuri Pattison’s studio scenes from the neoliberal present, when work and free time have collapsed into each other. Photo Carrie Mae Weems’s “The Blues,” a series of tinted photographs of the singer Mary J. Blige, at Jack Shainman Gallery’s booth at the fair. Credit Elizabeth Lippman for The New York Times But the show is badly overhung, with more than 100 works, not all memorable, in too little space. I suspect that Mr. Gartenfeld, who is at work on next year’s New Museum Triennial in New York, will need time to learn what the spaces of the new institute can do: There is good thinking here, and an impressive catalog, but “The Everywhere Studio” needs to be decluttered. Back by the beach, the Bass has completed its transformation by the architects David Gauld and Arata Isozaki ; the museum now has 50 percent more space on the same footprint, helped by the removal of cumbersome ramps that led visitors upstairs. In three inaugural solo shows, Mika Rottenberg is presenting a new video that takes her uncanny, dream-logic visions of factory work to the United States-Mexico border, while Pascale Marthine Tayou has disrupted the Bass’s permanent European wing with new African masks that evoke mass tourism and global trade. But it’s the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone who steals the show with a walk-in installation, hilarious and grim by turns, consisting of 45 full-size mannequins of clowns, seated on the gallery floor with expressions of boredom and fatigue. After a few days at the fair, the metaphor of the exhausted clown is all too apt.

TODD HEISLER,"Along with the New York Times reporters James Glanz and Frances Robles, we traversed the island by following the path of darkness left by Hurricanes Maria and Irma, visiting communities that are slowly regaining power and those that are still without it. The story tracks the early decisions officials made as hurricanes bore down on the island, and the substantial challenges of repairing a long-neglected power grid buffeted by back-to-back hurricanes. Bulldozers cleared paths up mountain ridges for utility workers, while in other places workers trudged through muddy tropical terrain to reach their objective. In some places, like San Germán, helicopters lowered poles into place atop steep ridges in a laborious process that would restore power to roughly 30 homes. But not all of the obstacles are physical. Supplies were slow to make it to the island in the days and weeks after the hurricanes. Contractors with little experience in disasters of this magnitude were hired, further slowing recovery. Whatever the case, there is one thing not being disputed: More than six months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept across Puerto Rico, people are still without power. In late February, Yabucoa was only at 18 percent power. On May 1, just before publication of our story, the town was up to 60 percent.","Reggie and Sylvia changing the batteries in their LED lanterns before going to bed.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Ms. Mahoney, 25, was eight months pregnant when Irma ripped away their doors and windows, allowing the blast of rain into their old apartment. It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again. They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.” Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak. Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19. The baby’s arrival helped persuade the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.” But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away. With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs. She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects. “It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” she said. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.” _____ Continue reading the main story","More than two months after the disaster on the U.S. Virgin Islands began, we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms hit.",2017-11-10T10:00:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",After Irma and Maria: How 3 Spots on the U.S. Virgin Islands Are Faring,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/virgin-islands-hurricanes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/00USVI-top2/00USVI-top2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
Andy Sullivan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida last September, the top U.S. disaster-response official ordered all hands on deck. With 4,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers already helping survivors of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, FEMA chief Brock Long told managers in an internal memo to ready every member of the agency’s on-call reservist workforce for deployment. In the following months, thousands of FEMA reservists, who account for about half of the agency’s disaster-response personnel, would descend on Florida, Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere to help recovery efforts after an unprecedented string of natural disasters. But not all would respond. About 500 reservists, or one of every twelve workers, ignored FEMA’s deployment request, current and former officials told Reuters. “We didn’t even hear from them,” Patrick Hernandez, who oversees FEMA’s disaster workforce, said in an interview. “We need to get people in here who understand the system and adhere to the protocols.” With the 2018 hurricane season already underway, FEMA is scrambling to hire more people who are willing to depart at a moment’s notice for assignments that can last months at a stretch. Internal documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the agency's disaster-response force is understaffed by 26 percent. And as last year revealed, many of those who sign up don't always respond when needed. (For graphic, see tmsnrt.rs/2Juw4LV ) That comes at a cost. At times, staffing shortages force FEMA to shuffle personnel from one disaster to the next and in some cases rely on workers who do not know how to do the job effectively, according to interviews with 15 current and former FEMA workers. Some local officials say the agency’s central mission - getting federal aid where it is needed - is undercut by the constant turnover. “They had no knowledge of the system. They had no knowledge about how to do anything but fill out forms,” said Junior Shelton, mayor of Central, Louisiana, which experienced catastrophic flooding in 2016. “We’re still sitting around waiting for that money to get here.” Hernandez said staffing issues have not affected FEMA’s ability to get the job done. “I would not agree with that statement wholeheartedly,” he said. Help wanted at FEMA: tmsnrt.rs/2Jxn6O1 ‘A VERY LOW NUMBER’ The extraordinary string of domestic disasters in 2017 continues to weigh on the U.S. agency. With thousands of workers still out in the field, official figures show that 33 percent of FEMA’s disaster-response workforce is available for deployment, down from 56 percent at this time last year. Some specialties are stretched especially thin: Only 13 percent of the workers who direct federal aid to pay for rebuilding costs after a disaster hits are currently available. “That’s a very low number, and that would be very scary going into more disasters,” said Elizabeth Zimmerman, a former senior FEMA official. Unlike military reservists, those who work for FEMA don’t have a guarantee that their regular jobs will be available when they return home. As a result, most are retirees who don’t need steady work or recent college graduates who don’t yet have a full-time job, current and former managers say. Reservists are allowed to turn down up to three assignments each year, meaning FEMA cannot count on a full reserve force during peak periods. According to internal figures, FEMA’s reservist corps has grown by roughly 1,000 workers over the past year. Still, it remains 3,700 workers short of the 10,949 reservists it has determined it needs to be able to respond to several disasters at once. Some reservists say they are not in a position to accept months-long assignments far from their homes. “I could get a phone call tomorrow telling me to go to Puerto Rico, but the truth is I’m not going to go,” said Alessandra Jerolleman, who said family obligations prevent her from leaving Louisiana. FEMA officials point out they can pull in other types of workers when needed. Some 22,000 federal employees from agencies like the Defense Department participated in disaster-relief work with FEMA in 2017, for example. “We rely on our reservists and we love them,” said FEMA’s Hernandez. “But FEMA’s made up of a lot of different elements.” SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS FEMA also hires residents of disaster zones to help out, a practice that is widely praised for boosting employment and harnessing local knowledge. But some say it can hinder FEMA’s effectiveness. Carlos Mercader, Puerto Rico’s top lobbyist in Washington, said he received numerous complaints of poorly trained FEMA workers who assess damaged houses in a seemingly arbitrary manner. While one might be declared a total loss, another that appeared to suffer similar damage might be denied reconstruction assistance, he said. Local hires accounted for more than half of the 2,878 FEMA employees in Puerto Rico in May, according to agency figures obtained by Reuters. Only 100 are permanent FEMA employees. “They probably should be sending us more people with as much experience as possible,” Mercader said. FEMA officials say Congress could help with recruiting and retaining reservists by guaranteeing they can keep their regular jobs while on assignment, as is the case with military reservists. Officials have also asked Congress to change hiring laws to give reservists preferential status when they apply for a full-time FEMA job. Congress has yet to act on those requests. But FEMA’s own actions may also drive away some who are willing to serve, reservists say. Paul Seldes, 59, said he tried unsuccessfully since 2011 to find an assignment that matched his background in field operations. Instead, the agency repeatedly asked him to report to a telephone call center to screen financial-aid requests from disaster survivors. By last fall, he no longer bothered to respond to such deployment requests, he said. “I have this capability, I have this knowledge, I have this training - why don’t you want to listen to me?” he said.

PATRICIA MAZZEI and ALAN BLINDER,"No Southern governor casts a more prolific figure during a hurricane than Mr. Scott, who has been darting from one county emergency operations center to the next for closed-door meetings and somber news conferences. Dressed in his iteration of what political strategists refer to as disaster casual a button-down shirt and a baseball cap that reads NAVY Mr. Scott rattles off warnings, admonitions and a litany of numbers intended to show the states emergency muscle. On Tuesday, he led a series of briefings, from the Panhandle city of DeFuniak Springs to Lecanto, about 80 miles from Orlando. A day earlier, his Democratic opponent, Mr. Nelson, tried to speak to reporters at the emergency management center in Tallahassee the same place where Mr. Scott often commands the states attention but was turned away because he was not there for official business. Hurricanes have been political opportunities for Mr. Scott, who has weathered the landfalls of three hurricanes and six tropical storms since his election in 2010, to show off his governors chops. Ahead of Hurricane Michael, his campaign was already airing a television spot reminding voters of his efforts during Hurricane Irma last year. The governors popularity peaked in the immediate aftermath of that storm; his unrelenting presence at televised news conferences is still remembered by Florida Keys residents, many of whom were reluctant to evacuate their homes but did so at Mr. Scotts insistence. Mr. Scotts administration came in for some criticism during that storm, after 12 people died at a nursing home in Broward County that lost power and could not keep the air-conditioning going. Nursing home officials said they had appealed to the authorities for help, to no avail. (State officials said no one had alerted them that people were in danger.) Mr. Nelson also aired an attack ad in August claiming that Mr. Scotts government had hired inexperienced contractors who overcharged for debris cleanup after Hurricane Irma prompting the governors campaign to accuse Mr. Nelson of politicizing hurricane recovery. Mr. Nelson, a senator since 2001 who also served a stint as Floridas insurance commissioner, is plenty familiar with hurricanes himself. He was also a frequent presence in the state during Irma, and on Tuesday, he joined other lawmakers in asking President Trump to declare a federal emergency in Florida, which the president did.","Hurricane Michael arrives in the height of campaign season in Florida, and Gov.

Nick Brown,"ADJUNTAS, PUERTO RICO (Reuters) - At 84 years old and battling cancer, Israel Gonzalez Maldonado has lived without electricity for the nine months since Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico. His wife, Zoraida Reyes, 77, struggles to keep the house stocked with fresh food without a refrigerator. At night, she fans her husband so he can sleep. With another hurricane season starting, older Puerto Ricans have little to protect them from another storm on an impoverished island that remains far from fully recovered. Younger and wealthier people have been moving away for years, leaving an older and sicker population in the hands of an underfunded healthcare system. Tens of thousands more have fled since Maria. “We wish we could move, at least for the time he has left,” Reyes said of her husband. Senior citizens make up a larger share of the population here than in all but four U.S. states, according to federal Census data. About half are disabled, more than any state. Forty percent of seniors rely on food stamps, more than three times the percentage in New York state, the second-highest nationally. (For a graphic on Puerto Rico's aging population, see: tmsnrt.rs/2L9N6M0 ) Yet the island has just six nursing homes - with a total of 159 beds - that are certified by the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid (CMS) to provide rehabilitative services. Puerto Rico relies instead on a patchwork of about 800 nursing homes licensed by the island’s Department of Family. They are typically private businesses or nonprofit organizations that care for small numbers of elderly people with limited services - and limited budgets, strained further since Maria. A fragile healthcare system is hardly the only problem that leaves the elderly here - and all Puerto Ricans - vulnerable to another catastrophic storm. About 7,000 houses and businesses still lack power, after Maria leveled a grid that was ill-maintained before the storm. Power utility PREPA has patched together most of the system but remains years away from making the fundamental improvements needed to enable it to withstand another hurricane. “The grid needs to be rebuilt - not just the lines,” PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins said. Maria also damaged nearly half the island’s levees. Several major water pumps, used to remove floodwater, remain in disrepair. “God help us, but we definitely can’t handle any more hurricanes,” said Tania Vazquez, the island’s secretary of natural resources. Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office declined to comment on the island’s hurricane preparedness or on specific efforts to protect the elderly, referring questions to other agencies. Glorimar Andujar, Secretary of the Department of Family, said officials learned a lot from Maria about how to prepare for the next storm. “The emergency plans are much better,” Andujar said, “because we now have an experience that no other generation of agency leaders have experienced.” ELDERLY AT RISK Rosa Iturrizaga runs Hostal de Amigos, a small eldercare residence in San Juan. The home barely broke even before Maria, relying on resident fees of between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. Since then, two of 11 residents moved to the mainland, and insurance has so far not paid for about $40,000 in storm damage, Iturrizaga said. The business carries $500,000 in debt, has fallen behind on loan and tax payments and now loses up to $5,000 a month. “I don’t know what’s kept me going,” Iturrizaga said. “I love doing this, but I’m looking at other things to do with the land.” Another private home, the nonprofit Asilo San Rafael in Arecibo, theoretically charges residents $1,200 a month; in reality, only three of 27 residents pay full price, and at least nine pay nothing, said board member Lucila Oliver. Operating costs run about $700,000 annually, with about $110,000 coming from a handful of subsidies from the island’s central government – subsidies she says have declined sharply in recent years as the now-bankrupt Puerto Rican government fell into a fiscal crisis, Oliver said. The Department of Family’s Andujar disputed that the subsidies have declined, but Oliver provided Reuters with balance sheets showing a drop in department funding to $59,000 this fiscal year from $80,000 last year. Maria brought new costs: about $1,200 a month to bring in water tanks, and thousands more on diesel for generators. Oliver said San Rafael is “used to living on the edge,” but says the edge has drawn closer since the hurricanes. Many elderly and disabled here find a way to get by at home, with little care. Some seek help from the Department of Family, applying for a caregiver to come by just a day or two a week, said Andujar. Many are turned away, she said. “The funding is very limited,” she said, “and the need is very big.” PREPARING FOR ANOTHER HIT This hurricane season, the department is making sure it has accurate locations for all licensed nursing homes after cell phone service disruptions stymied the response to Hurricane Maria. The homes, Andujar said, are now required to have 30 days of food on hand, and the department has also requested they have generators and water tanks. She added that about 315,000 elderly people currently receive benefits as part of a $1.27 billion federal allocation under the Nutritional Assistance Program. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) remains on the island and said it has given municipalities money to improve community resilience. Dr. Carmen Sanchez Salgado, Puerto Rico’s ombudsmen for the elderly, said her staff has been educating elderly people about the emergency supplies they need. Charities and nonprofits have also helped. The nonprofit PRxPR, created in response to Maria, is funding solar panels for elderly people and community centers. One such center in Naguabo had no power as recently as four weeks ago, said Carmen Baez, the group’s co-founder. “Our installation was it,” she said.

Andrew Freedman,"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history. The notorious storms of 2017 — hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — may have had innocuous names. However, they flooded America's fourth-largest metropolis, cut a swath of destruction across the Caribbean before hitting Florida, and cut off power to the entire island of Puerto Rico, respectively. The costs of the storms that hit the U.S. are still being tallied, with some analysts claiming that it was the most expensive hurricane season on record. Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with the insurance company AonBenfield, said that his company's calculations show that direct damage and business interruption losses from 2017's many storms will put 2017 in second place, behind 2005, once adjusted for inflation. SEE ALSO: San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz talks Puerto Rico's recovery with Stephen Colbert It's possible that ranking will change, however. ""There remains so much uncertainty with the three big storms (Harvey, Irma, Maria), and insurance claims continue to be filed and processed,"" Bowen said via Twitter message. ""A big component to the direct damage losses remains business interruption, and especially in the case of Maria in Puerto Rico, those direct impacts remain ongoing,"" Bowen said. ""The 2017 season is going to end near the top on an economic and insured loss basis once all is said and done. Regardless of what metric is used to determine 2017's ranking... the season was extraordinarily costly and will be used as one of the benchmark years against which future seasons are compared,"" Bowen said. Puerto Rico still has not woken up from the nightmare caused by Hurricane Maria. It's been 71 days since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, but residents there are still struggling without access to electricity, as well as other basic services. As of Thursday afternoon, electricity generation on Puerto Rico — which is not the same as the percentage of people who are receiving power — stood at 65 percent. About 7 percent of Puerto Rican residents are without access to safe drinking water, according to the territory's website. Repairs are still being made to electricity and transportation infrastructure in the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas that in many cases were hit with two major hurricanes in a row. The Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, especially when compared to the mobilization mounted in the wake of other storms that struck the U.S. mainland, is widely viewed to be abysmal. A season of destructive hurricanes Even veteran hurricane forecasters were stunned by the beastly storms that prowled the Atlantic Ocean this season. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 storm, resulted in the heaviest rainstorm ever recorded in the country. The storm inundated large swaths of the Houston metro area, dumping as much as 5 feet of rain over the course of a few days. Such unprecedented rainfall turned highways into raging rivers, flooded petrochemical plants, and destroyed tens of thousands of cars, homes, and businesses. Harvey was followed by another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Irma, marking the first time the U.S. has been hit by two Category 4 storms in the same season. Irma reserved it greatest ferocity for islands in the Caribbean, practically wiping out the island of Barbuda, and stripping the lush vegetation of the Virgin Islands bare. Hurricane Irma remained a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for a consecutive 37 hours, a new world record, and also broke the record for the strongest hurricane observed in the Atlantic outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Based on its windspeed, it also tied for second on the list of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes of all-time, behind Hurricane Allen in 1980. Then came Hurricane Maria, which rapidly intensified on September 18, and also raked parts of the Leeward Islands and Caribbean. Maria caused widespread damage when it hit the tiny island of Dominica as a Category 5 storm, and became the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. The Atlantic season kept setting records into October, when Hurricane Ophelia became the strongest storm to form so far east in the North Atlantic. By reaching Category 3 intensity, Ophelia also became the sixth major hurricane of Category 3 or greater to form during the 2017 season. Hurricane Ophelia underwent a transition into a powerful hybrid, and then a non-tropical storm, that struck Ireland with winds as strong as 119 miles per hour. While the hurricanes of 2017 were fierce, none of the Category 4 or 5 storms hit without extremely accurate warnings. In fact, preliminary data from the National Hurricane Center show that storm track forecasts for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were about 25 percent more accurate than average. Storm intensity forecasts, however, remained a bigger challenge, as some of these storms underwent periods of astonishingly rapid intensification that defied expectations. For millions from Houston to St. Johns, the off season will be spent rebuilding and attempting to get their lives back to normalcy. Meanwhile, hurricane forecasters will work to improve their techniques and computer models in time for next year.","The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","You might want to turn the sound on. I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it. New research released on Wednesday in Nature chronicled a bizarre experiment involving lizards from Turks and Caicos, a stick, and a leaf blower. The goal? To study how hurricanes influence natural selection, of course. Last year’s brutal hurricane season took a toll on wildlife in the Caribbean, as Hurricanes Irma and Maria rattled ecosystems from the Florida Everglades to Puerto Rico’s rainforest. Researchers are still digging into how wildlife bounced back from the pounding storms, but the new research goes one step further by looking at how the storms may have left an imprint on future generations of lizards in Turks and Caicos. Scientists’ ability to tease this out involved a weird twist of academic fate. An international team of researchers had been conducting studies of populations of Anolis scriptus lizards spread across two islands. They finished their fieldwork four days before Hurricane Irma slammed into their research sites with 165-mph winds. Two weeks later, Maria plowed through the area again with 124-mph winds. That gave scientists a rare opportunity to look at whether the lizards that survived were different, on average, from the pre-storm populations. They found that the lizards who weathered the storm had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs, and shorter back legs. The researchers hypothesize that the first two qualities allowed the lizards to cling for dear life with a stronger grip than their shrimpy-limbed brethren. Meanwhile, the shorter back legs allowed them to be more aerodynamic in the hurricane-force winds, acting like a wind sock rather than a piece of sheet metal. But why just hypothesize when you can test it out, amirite? The researchers took lizards to a lab of horrors to measure what they innocuously called “performance capacity.” In this case, it meant having the lizards do their best Jim Cantore impression by having them cling to a pole while a leaf blower tossed them about in hurricane-force winds (side note: leaf blowers are no joke apparently). Amazingly, the little buggers were able to hang on, even in winds up to 108 mph. While it may look like a lizard version of Saw, the researchers stressed that no lizards were harmed—when they finally lost their grip, they flew into a nice, soft net. All of them were returned to the locations where they had been collected. Even so, there’s no way to measure the psychological trauma potentially experienced by these poor lizards. The findings are the first of their kind to measure natural selection before and after a storm.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm. The tropics have gone wild, with three hurricanes spinning at the same time, as you can see for yourself in satellite imagery captured as the sun rose on the Atlantic Monday morning. In addition to rapidly-strengthening Florence (which just hit Category 3 status), Helene and Isaac became hurricanes on Sunday. More than 2,000 miles separates the three hurricanes so the only way to view them all together is from space. Luckily, there’s a way to do that thanks to GOES 16. The next generation satellite was launched last year with the express intent of improving our view of hurricanes to improve forecasts. But it also provides one hell of a view to the public, showing what our planet is capable of from a vantage point of more than 22,000 miles above the Earth’s surface. GOES 16 also has the ability to zoom in on specific hurricanes, providing close-up views that are equal parts beautiful and harrowing. The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration released imagery on Monday showing the sun rise over the eye of hurricane Florence. The swirl of clouds around the hurricane’s center, which is starting to clear out, are a sign it’s strengthening as expected. If robots in space aren’t enough, may I offer you one last view courtesy of astronauts? The International Space Station passed over the Atlantic on Monday morning, and astronaut Ricky Arnold shared the absolutely wild images of Florence in a tweet on Monday morning. This the eleventh time on record that three hurricanes have been active at the same time in the Atlantic. The most recent time was last year, when Irma, Jose and Maria all reached hurricane status at the same time. The scars of Irma and Maria are still clear in the Caribbean and Florida. The forecasts for Florence and Isaac are disconcerting as well, making it hard to really savor the views from space. While Helene is likely to steer off into the central Atlantic and poses no immediate risk to land, Florence is rapidly strengthening and is likely to reach the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic by Thursday as a very strong hurricane with a major storm surge risk. It’s quite possible it could stall out over land and dump copious rainfall inland, creating the potential for historic flooding. Meanwhile, Isaac is plowing toward the Caribbean and the Lesser Antilles. While it’s a small hurricane, it could still bring rain and storm surge to a number of islands from Barbados to Antigua. Puerto Rico is also within the storm’s forecast cone, though there’s a lot that can happen between now and this weekend to change its exact track. Still, it’s a storm that bears watching.","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"Tropical Storm Isaac was strengthening and the National Hurricane Center expected it to be upgraded to a hurricane by Sunday night. It was headed toward the Caribbean, but no warnings had been posted. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Helene was close to the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa and was expected to go out to sea after it passes the islands. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Paul was southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Forecasters expected it to remain a tropical storm and head out into the open water. A second tropical storm in the Pacific, Olivia, could threaten Hawaii in a couple of days, but it was too early to tell, Mr. Feltgen said. Having five systems in the Western Hemisphere is fairly common for this time of year. Sept. 10 is considered the statistical peak of the hurricane season, Mr. Feltgen, said, adding, “This is right on target.” Last year at this time, Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia were billowing in the Atlantic basin. “This is not unusual,” Mr. Feltgen said. “But there is no such a thing as just a storm.” Separately, parts of Ohio saw close to nine inches of rain over the weekend brought by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon. Ben Gelber, a meteorologist at the NBC affiliate WCMH-TV, described the rain as “really excessive,” noting that most of the state got three to five inches and some pockets saw as much as nine inches.","The National Hurricane Center warned of two life-threatening impacts, especially for South Carolina: storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from prolonged rain.",2018-09-09T21:05:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Florence Strengthening and Targeting the Southeast Coast, Forecasters Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/hurricane-florence-isaac-weather-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/us/10-xp-florence/10-xp-florence-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — Adm. Karl L. Schultz was named the 26th commandant of the Coast Guard on Friday, taking over a military service that is in the midst of a fleet modernization as it juggles homeland security priorities like intercepting drugs and migrants and responding to disasters. President Trump attended Admiral Schultz’s change of command ceremony, held on the first day of the annual hurricane season. “I envision our heading remaining generally steady,” Admiral Schultz said. It was a compliment to his predecessor Adm. Paul F.

Admiral Schultz had commanded the Coast Guard’s Atlantic area and last year oversaw the fleet’s response to Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey.

Amy Held,"Beryl, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season was headed for the Lesser Antilles, where it was expected to make landfall by Monday. National Hurricane Center It may be tiny, but Beryl is scrappy. The Category 1 hurricane, the first of the 2018 Atlantic season, strengthened from a tropical depression to a hurricane within 24 hours, surprising specialists who dubbed it "" Brazen Beryl."" By midday Friday, Beryl was churning about 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean; it's expected to reach land by late Sunday or early Monday. Forecasters say the storm will likely maintain its hurricane status as it approaches and crosses the islands. ""It is possible that we could have hurricane watches up for some of those islands by tonight,"" said Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center. Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph on Friday afternoon as it churned across the water. ""The hurricane force winds only extend outwards about 10 miles from the center, and the eye itself is about five miles wide"" Berg said. ""So that's just a very tiny system. We don't see many hurricanes that small."" And yet, Berg said the conditions ahead of Beryl could allow it to strengthen a bit over the next few days as it heads for the island chain extending from the Virgin Islands to Grenada. Some of the islands are still recovering from the devastation wrought by September's back-to-back powerful hurricanes Irma and Maria. But those were top-of-scale Category 5 storms. Berg cautioned that because Beryl is so small and located so far out at sea, it's too early to say for sure which islands might be impacted and how badly. ""Regardless of its strength, we would expect it to bring heavy rainfall to some of those islands, which could be prone to flash flooding and mudslides,"" Berg said. Meantime, forecasters are also keeping an eye on a weather system off the coast of North Carolina that could turn into a tropical depression over the weekend. Berg said forecasters aren't expecting it to move inland, ""but it could get close enough to the coast to cause some impacts like wind and heavy rain.""",The Category 1 storm is expected to cross the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean by late Sunday or early Monday.

Mark Kaufman,"The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. But it can get quite a bit stormier than that. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers looked at hurricane seasons dating back to 1851 and found that it's quite unlikely any Atlantic hurricane season will surpass the 28 named storms and 15 hurricanes produced during the 2005 season, infamous for the deadly Hurricane Katrina that struck the Gulf Coast. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires ""To me, it makes sense that 2005 is about as many as you can get,"" Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Using sophisticated weather models, the research team ran over 6,000 simulations of a wide range of weather conditions — such as temperature, winds, and air pressure — that our present climate can produce. They found that there's less than a 3.2 percent chance that any combination of conditions might result in more than 28 storms forming in any given year, which they took to mean 28 cyclones is pretty much the Atlantic Ocean's maximum storm potential. Hurricane Katrina makes landfall in 2005. Image: nasa This could be useful information for both Atlantic nations and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences’ Risk Prediction Initiative, the natural catastrophe research group that funded the study. But, it's not really the number of storms that matters for people on the ground. ""At the end of the day, if you have 28 weak pieces of junk, no one cares,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the Irmas people care about."" Last year, Hurricane Irma made landfall several times in the Caribbean, including leveling 95 percent of the structures on the island of Barbuda, before hitting Florida and causing severe flooding. Wind and water damage from the storm in the U.S. alone amounted to an estimated $50 billion, and, in total, Irma killed 47 people, though many more indirect deaths were reported. It could be a quiet storm year overall, said Klotzbach, but ""obviously all it takes is one or two high-profile storms to make the headlines and cause a lot of damage."" How about future storms in a changing climate? This study looked exclusively at what our present climate could produce in the Atlantic. Running sophisticated models on powerful computers has time and budget constraints, so the researchers restricted their research to the present. ""Of course, future climate is very important to consider,"" Sally Lavender, the study's lead author and researcher at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research, said over email. Yet, a changing climate doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes, like it does more heat waves and wildfires. Massive Hurricane Irma passing the eastern end of Cuba on September 8, 2017. Image: nasa ""Based on work by others it is not at all clear if we could expect an increase in the numbers of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic,"" said Lavender. Klotzbach agrees. ""Most models don’t show the number of storms increasing,"" said Klotzbach. ""In general, the number of storms is probably not going to change that much."" Still, future storms may carry more water, noted Klotzbach, or they may bring stronger winds, said Lavender. There's also strong evidence that storms are slowing down, which would mean considerably more flooding and destruction over the unlucky regions the storms stall over. Even so, Klotzbach emphasized that we might as well focus on preparing for what could happen today. In the 1940s, for example, five Category 4 and 5 storms (the highest rated storms) pummeled Florida over the course of six years. And with coastal development and massive population increases since then, we're not prepared to deal with that sort of storm onslaught, said Klotzbach. ""We’re not prepared for what we have now,"" he said. ""When Category 5's start hitting Florida again, it's going to be bad.""","The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes.

Daniella Cheslow,"Gabriel Hernandez is one of two Puerto Rican chefs named as semifinalists for the best chef of the South category in the 2018 James Beard Awards. The recognition comes as the island's restaurants recover from Hurricane Maria. Daniella Cheslow/NPR Finalists for the James Beard Awards — known as the Oscars of the food world — will be announced Wednesday. Among those waiting to hear if they made the cut are two chefs from San Juan, Puerto Rico, who are nursing their restaurants back to life six months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Chef Gabriel Hernandez slept on his restaurant floor for three weeks and served iceberg lettuce when there was little other produce available. Jose Enrique opened his eponymous restaurant as a staging kitchen for José Andrés' mass-cooking charity operation before his generator died. Both chefs were named as semifinalists for the Beard awards last month. ""It [was] an amazing surprise,"" says Hernandez, a first-time semifinalist and the chef and co-owner at Verde Mesa in Old San Juan. ""Especially these last couple of months have been a really hard process to restore the restaurant."" In December, Hernandez spoke to NPR during the lunch service at Verde Mesa. Then, as now, he had not resumed dinner service due to lack of clientele. He had three cooks instead of the nine who worked before the hurricane. His credit card machine didn't work. His air conditioner was still broken after the storm broke his compressor. But at least his restaurant was open. After the hurricane hit, Hernandez had to camp out in Verde Mesa — with power out across the island, his electric storm shutters at home would not open. Hurricane Irma, which hit in early September, had depleted his emergency savings, leaving him exposed when Maria made landfall two weeks later. Even if he had re-opened his restaurant back then, he says, ""there was no economical movement in San Juan."" Hernandez was only able to reopen in early November because a guest knocked on his door and offered him a generator. He rewired his kitchen to use only one electrical appliance instead of four and used Sterno cans to heat a stew menu. ""And then we used whatever we can do in our power to make great, amazing appetizers using whatever we can find,"" Hernandez says. ""That was the challenge."" Nearly all of Puerto Rico's food is imported from the mainland U.S. In recent years, amid an economic recession on the island, a local farm movement blossomed, including several farm-to-table restaurants. Hernandez says his restaurant aims ""to create a new culinary identity"" for Puerto Rico. But after the storm, about 80 percent of the island's meager crops were destroyed. In December, Hernandez celebrated the return of fresh radishes, butter lettuce, eggplant and chayote, a local squash. He served the chayote thinly sliced with chunks of mango and flecks of cilantro and black sesame as a tangy appetizer. Also on the menu: Serenata de Bacalao, a salad of yams, hard-boiled eggs and cod, which traces back to Spanish colonists who packed their barges with the dried salted fish. In December, Puerto Rican chef Gabriel Hernandez celebrated the return of locally grown radishes. Most of the growers that supplied his restaurant saw their crops destroyed during Hurricane Maria. Daniella Cheslow/NPR Hernandez is an accidental chef. He studied electronics engineering technology but found he didn't like the field. So he started working as a runner in a local restaurant, then became a waiter and bartender. Nine years ago, he and a partner decided to open a simple soup and salad eatery in Old San Juan. In the beginning, ""we didn't have the money to hire a chef, so I started working in the kitchen,"" he says. Verde Mesa evolved over the years and moved to a bigger space seating 40, with airy windows letting in a sea breeze and vintage chandeliers hanging amid sea green-painted walls. Eventually, Hernandez says he hired a professionally trained sous chef and kitchen supervisor. He says he paid his sous chef a salary even when his restaurant was closed after Maria because he imagined he would be crucial to recovery. ""Starting over without a sous chef I've been training for so many years [would be too] hard,"" Hernandez says. For Jose Enrique, James Beard recognition is an annual exercise. He has been a semifinalist or nominee for the best chef of the South category each year since 2013. Enrique trained at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and cooked in New Orleans. About a decade ago, he moved back to Puerto Rico and took over a restaurant in an old house in San Juan's Santurce neighborhood. His restaurant has no sign to mark its presence, but it is steps from La Placita, the market square where each night locals drink and dance to salsa music in a handful of bars. Enrique says before the storm, his restaurant had become a pilgrimage point. Lines snaked out of the charming veranda; guests waited as long as two hours to grab one of his 37 seats. He managed to stay open for about 10 days after the storm thanks to a generator. During that time, celebrity chef José Andrés enlisted Enrique — and his restaurant's kitchen — in his mission to feed the hurricane victims. ""Those first 10 days we were pumping food out for the island. Those first 10 days we worked was volunteering,"" Enrique says. Then his generator died and he could not get it fixed amid the surging demand. So Enrique closed the restaurant for nearly two months. ""I tried to do something every day in the restaurant – open the windows, clean.... It was a rough time,"" he says. He finally reopened after electricity was restored to San Juan. ""I think if we would have had another two weeks without power, we would have been closed "" for good. Before the storm, Enrique says he had days when nearly 75 percent of his menu was locally sourced. Now, he is far from that. ""Even now it's hard to get plantains, which is something everybody eats here every day,"" Enrique says. The James Beard Foundation will announce its shortlist of nominees Wednesday. Myriam Ocasio, a local food writer, says she thinks a win is a ""long shot"" for either Hernandez or Enrique. It's not because of a lack of talent, Ocasio tells NPR in a an email, but because the awards have tended to "" pick chefs from the mainland, overlooking ours. I feel that Puerto Rico is the culinary destination of the Caribbean, but we just have not been recognized as such."" Enrique says regardless of how the awards turn out, Puerto Rico is experiencing a rebirth. He says his business has recovered to two-thirds of its former volume. Before the hurricane, he says, local growers were cultivating ""beautiful carrots"" and flavorful honey. Now, he says, that farming movement is showing signs of life again. ""I believe it's going to come back bigger than before the hurricane,"" he says.","After hurricanes Irma and Maria, these chefs defied the destruction, kept their restaurants open and fed hungry victims.

Mark Kaufman,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one. Forecasters say that there's a 70 percent chance that the season will be active with hurricanes, but it's unlikely that we'll see the extremes of 2017, when six major storms (which have sustained destructive winds of at least 111 mph ) roared through the Atlantic. ""Last year was extremely active,"" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. ""It was one of the strongest seasons on record."" SEE ALSO: Fighting climate change could save the world trillions of dollars This coming year, NOAA's analysis of long-term climate trends in the Atlantic Ocean, the temperature of the ocean, and other factors, don't add up to conditions that would stoke an extreme hurricane season. ""Right now we're not seeing any strong climate signals that say the season would be as strong as last year,"" said Bell. But, NOAA is seeing the signal for a season that is either ""normal"" or ""above normal."" There's just a 25 percent chance that the season will be ""below normal."" Image: Noaa For perspective, the rare 2017 season saw 17 named storms (winds higher than 39 mph), six of which were major hurricanes of Category 3 or above, like hurricane Harvey and Irma last year. Bell said that a ""normal"" season would be 10 to 12 named storms, with five to six total hurricanes, one or two of which would be major, devastating cyclones (think Hurricane Harvey or Irma). There's a reasonable chance, about 35 percent, that these storm numbers and intensities could be punched up a little more, however, and enter the ""above normal"" spectrum. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, though Bell notes the peak of the season is in August, September, and October. For this reason, NOAA will produce an updated forecast in early August. These are the names NOAA will use to name storms during this hurricane season. Image: NOAA The 2018 season begins as many areas are still reeling from the 2017 pummeling. Recovering from Hurricane Harvey alone has a price tag that exceeds $125 billion, according to NOAA. Puerto Rico is still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Maria, with more than 14,000 people still without power on the island, according to an ABC report. There are some 80 million Americans that live in hurricane territory, notes Bell, so he hopes people start preparing. This means getting flood insurance, having an evacuation plan, downloading the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app, and heeding warnings. Since 1995, the Atlantic has experienced a high amount of hurricane activity said Bell, in large part due to a decades-long climate trend occurring in Atlantic, called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which warmer waters produce stronger storms. Some studies also suggest that as human-caused climate change worsens, extreme weather events could become more frequent and severe.","On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one.

Marisa Peñaloza,"Irma Rivera Aviles and her husband Ivan Martínez stand in front of their home last month. Rivera Aviles was ecstatic about the restoration of power to her neighborhood last Friday. Marisa Penaloza/NPR Irma Rivera Aviles and Ivan Martínez finally got power back in their home in Cataño last Friday afternoon. ""Christmas has arrived!"" Rivera Aviles said ecstatically on Monday. Hurricane María hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, causing Rivera Aviles and Martínez to evacuate to a shelter for more than a week. When they returned to their home in a section of Cataño called El Pueblito, they found it badly damaged as the storm had blown off part of the roof. The hurricane also knocked out power on the entire island, causing Rivera Aviles to feel unsafe in this neighborhood, where she grew up. But on Friday, all that changed. Now, she feels ""safe, secure."" In Cataño, people mark the start of the holiday season on the first Friday of December. This year residents celebrated that as well as the return of power to most of the neighborhood. On Friday evening, residents gathered at the waterfront outside City Hall in Cataño to cheer and sing holiday songs. ""I felt this intense happiness,"" Rivera Aviles said, her voice trembling. ""I can't find the words to describe it."" For her, seeing the lights back on at Nuestra Señora Del Carmen Church was the best Christmas gift ever. There are a few neighborhoods in Cataño, including Vietnam and Puntillas, that are still without power and the priest offered those still in need to come in to the church and charge their cellphones or iron their clothes, Rivera Aviles said. Luckily, their home appliances are working and for the first time in more than two months the couple watched the news on TV at home. They went grocery shopping and cooked breakfast in their kitchen on Saturday morning — scrambled eggs with ham and pancakes. ""I felt alive again,"" she said.

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.

FRANCES ROBLES,"“We don’t want to spend the rest of our lives in hotels,” Mr. Santiago said. “We’re not asking FEMA to support us, just to help us until we are more stable. If this has been so hard for me, I can’t imagine what it’s like for the people with little kids or illnesses.” Mr. Santiago moved to Florida in December from Corozal, where his home was destroyed. He is working for a transportation company but not earning enough to afford an apartment. “Every time the deadline approaches, your nerves are shot,” he said. Lawyers for LatinoJustice argued that survivors of past storms had received more help. Hurricane Katrina survivors stayed in hotels for 27 months, Ms. Bannan said. Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven benefit extensions, but Hurricane Maria survivors received just three, the group said. The judge found, however, that those previous storms affected far more people. The governor of Puerto Rico, the judge noted, stopped asking for extensions to the voucher program once a provision under FEMA rules took effect that would have required the government of Puerto Rico to share 10 percent of the housing costs. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FEMA said there are 1,038 families still receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance across 27 states, with about 400 of them in Puerto Rico. “FEMA is working with its vendor and notifying participating hotels that the TSA program has been extended to comply with the court’s order, said Lenisha Smith, a FEMA spokeswoman. “Beyond that, FEMA will not comment on pending litigation.” Although Judge Hillman found that FEMA’s funding of the housing assistance program was “discretionary” and denied the request for an injunction, he urged the government to find a way to help the families.","After months of temporary reprieves, the judge says temporary housing vouchers for victims of Hurricane Maria staying in hotels can be ended on Sept. 13.",2018-08-31T17:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Government Can Stop Paying to House Puerto Rico Hurricane Victims, Judge Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/puerto-rico-fema-housing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/31puerto-print/31puerto-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1

Or, okay, maybe you would expect that. SEE ALSO: Florida student scores 124 free pairs of Crocs for a very comfy graduation ceremony Thankfully, there are no real zombies lurking in Florida. Rather, it was a false alert sent during a power outage that alerted the citizens of Lake Worth to zombies in the area. According to the Palm Beach Post, the alert sent Sunday reads: ""Power outage and zombie alert for residents of Lake Worth and Terminus. There are now far less than seven thousand three hundred and eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity. Restoration time uncertain."" FYI, ""Terminus"" is a location from the AMC zombie hit TV series, The Walking Dead. In a statement shared to the Lake Worth Live Facebook page, the city's Public Information Officer Ben Kerr made it clear that, no, zombies aren't roaming the Florida community. ""I want to reiterate that Lake Worth does not have any zombie activity currently and apologize for the system message,"" reads the statement. In a chat with Gizmodo, Kerr said that the city's been dealing with fake zombie alerts since Hurricane Irma hit the state back in 2017. He told the site that though someone broke into the city's messaging system and added undead references to some pre-written alerts, the city has since removed those messages. It hasn't been a great year for public alert systems, considering January's false missile alert in Hawaii. At least this one was more farfetched and less likely to cause actual panic. But let's be real — if a zombie apocalypse were to start anywhere, it would be in Florida.","Though Florida makes headlines for all sorts of fun and bizarre reasons, finding the Sunshine State at the genesis of the zombie apocalypse is a turn of events you might not expect.

Rachel Becker,"When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia in its path, new NASA images show. The pictures are a stark reminder of our energy infrastructure’s vulnerability to natural disasters. The pictures went up today on NASA’s Earth Observatory blog, but lights have started to turn back on since the “after” image was snapped on October 12th. At this point, the number of customers without power has dropped to 163,000 from the 2.6 million that lost power after the storm, according to the Edison Electric Institute. (To be clear, that count reflects the number of meters that aren’t getting electricity, not the number of people, which is probably higher.) Some areas may have to wait weeks or even months for the grid to be repaired enough for the power to turn back on, NASA’s Earth Observatory says. That’s a lot of time for people to be without electricity for things like powering refrigerators, charging up medical devices, and running AC units. So why don’t hurricane-prone regions like Florida bury their power lines instead of stringing them up just to be torn down by powerful winds? Last year, 6.7 million of Florida’s electricity customers lost power after Hurricane Irma hit, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s almost two-thirds of the customers in the state. It’s a question that Ted Kury, director of energy studies at the University of Florida, has been studying. And the answer is: it’s complicated, he writes in an article for The Conversation. Sure, burying power lines underground keeps them safe from wind, but it can also increase the risk that storm surge and flooding could damage the wires. Plus, putting wires underground is expensive, and it can make it more difficult to get at the power lines for repairs. Power companies have to weigh the pros and cons of undergrounding versus more mainstream strategies like making sure a stiff wind won’t topple trees onto power lines. And as climate change increases hurricane intensity, the stakes for that calculation will continue to rise.","When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia that were in its path, new NASA images show.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"But economists do not necessarily agree. Those who study immigration and labor patterns have questioned the wisdom of restricting family-based immigration, a crucial source of low-skilled workers, many of whom hail from countries like Mexico and the Philippines, where Ms. Mangayan, 47, is from. “In any plausible future scenario, the U.S. needs far more new low-skilled workers than high-skilled workers,” said Michael Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank, “so many that it will be impossible for native labor to fill all those jobs, even if native workers wanted to.” According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis, among the 10 occupations expected to grow the most through 2026, only three require university degrees, all of them digital or data-focused: software developers, statisticians and mathematicians. The two that will require the most new workers: personal care and home health aides, with 1.2 million new positions between them. About 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, and more than half will need long-term care, according to the Pew Research Center. Already, home-care agencies and elderly-care facilities are struggling to recruit. “If one of our aides is sick or has an emergency, it’s very difficult to find a backup,” said Kevin Smith, the president of Best of Care in the Boston area, who taps into the large Haitian and Brazilian communities in Massachusetts. Photo Ms. Mangayan, who married an American and is now a citizen, earns $29,000 a year taking care of elderly residents. Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times In 2017, 26 percent of personal care aides and home health aides were foreign born, a high, according to an analysis of official data by Brian Schaitkin, a senior economist at the Conference Board. In New York, 62 percent of home aides were foreign born. In California, Massachusetts and New Jersey, foreigners represented nearly half of them. Lupe Mercado, a Mexican immigrant who works for an agency called 24Hr HomeCare in Los Angeles, has endeared herself to clients with dementia who initially cursed and flung food at her. One of them recently died holding her hand, Ms. Mercado noted, brandishing a picture of the woman on her cellphone. On a recent afternoon, she doted on Olive Tanaka, 92. “I’m spoiled by her,” said Ms. Tanaka, a line dancer in her day who is now widowed, blind in one eye and needs round-the-clock care since suffering a fall. Having entered the United States illegally, Ms. Mercado benefited from a 1986 amnesty law signed by President Ronald Reagan, obtaining a green card and eventually becoming a citizen. “It doesn’t pay so much but I love my job,” said Ms. Mercado, who earns $12 an hour, and supplements her pay by taking private clients on her days off. Proponents of restricting immigration say the low wages in her field — and in other workplaces where immigrants have a foothold, like construction, farms, and restaurant kitchens — are a prime reason immigrants have begun to supplant American workers in the jobs. Some of those other professions, too, face worker shortages. A survey in September by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 70 percent of construction firms were having difficulty finding bricklayers, roofers and electricians, among others. Last August, the restaurant and accommodation sector had 742,000 vacancies, a historic high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Stemming the flow of low-skilled immigrants could put pressure on employers to raise wages, compelling many Americans, including millions who are chronically unemployed, to get back to work. “It may draw all these people, or some fraction of these people, into the labor force,” posited Steven Camarota, research director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration. Indeed, more people would do blue-collar work they now shun if wages were higher — but not enough of them would, according to Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Wage is not the main issue. There are also expectations and status,” he said. “Not everybody wants to work with their hands touching people; not everybody will do dirty work.” Supporters of an immigration overhaul cite other reasons the country should be choosier about whom it lets in. The Trump administration has also framed it as a national security issue, noting several cases where terror suspects came to the United States through family connections. Immigrants are also more likely to use welfare programs than native-born Americans, owing largely to their comparatively low skill levels upon arrival, the Center for Immigration Studies says, citing Census Bureau data. Under a House bill introduced by Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, and supported by the White House, citizens and permanent residents, or green card holders, could continue to bring spouses and children under 18 into the United States. But they would no longer be able to sponsor parents, adult children, siblings, nephews and nieces. Photo Lupe Mercado, a caregiver originally from Mexico, helps Olive Tanaka during a walk near Ms. Tanaka’s home in Gardena, Calif. Credit Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times The bill would also create a point system for admission based on factors including education, English skills, and job offers in the United States, and it would cut the overall number of green cards awarded each year by half, to 500,000. Employers who rely on immigrant labor are anxious about what will happen in Washington. Senior-care agencies in particular are worried because many are dependent on Medicaid and Medicare and so cannot, they say, easily raise wages to make their jobs more attractive to native-born workers. If Congress makes it harder for relatives to immigrate, “Where are all these workers going to come from?” asked Patricia Will, the founder of Belmont Village, a Houston-based network of upscale facilities that employs 4,000 people in several states. Ms. Mangayan, who makes $29,000 a year plus benefits at Belmont Village in Burbank, came to the United States in 1997 after marrying an American citizen, and she is now a citizen herself. She would have been able to immigrate under the proposed rules, though many of her co-workers would not. Ms. Mangayan and her husband, a customer-service representative at the airport, earn enough to afford a $1,200-a-month two-bedroom apartment; their 23-year-old son’s college tuition; and occasional travel to the Philippines. Ms. Mangayan does hair to make extra money on the side. Ms. Mangayan, who also has a 14-year-old daughter, said that one day, “I would like to have at least a condo.” Not long after arriving for her 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift one recent afternoon, she was already darting from room to room. In room 411, she improvised sign language to communicate with Bernard Bragg, an 89-year-old who achieved fame decades ago as a deaf-mute actor. Mr. Bragg, asked what he thought of Ms. Mangayan, pointed to her, placed his hands over his heart and smiled lovingly. He then flapped his arms to suggest she was an angel. Velma Vincent, in room 406, credited Ms. Mangayan with restoring her will to live and ability to walk after her husband died. “I was a goner,” recalled Ms. Vincent, 88, who was resplendent in a bright-red blouse and white slacks with matching red necklace, earrings and nail polish. “Irma came in and encouraged me.” Ms. Mangayan had coaxed Ms. Vincent to get out of her wheelchair, practice baby steps down the hall, going farther and farther each time. Soon, Ms. Vincent was mobile — and independent — with her walker, playing blackjack and Bingo, attending church and visiting Belmont Village’s beauty salon. “My family will be forever grateful,” said her son, Bob Vincent. “that Irma emigrated from the Philippines to the United States, giving my mom a quality of life that she would not enjoy were it not for Irma.” Continue reading the main story",A proposal to change the immigration system from family-based to skills-based could shrink a primary source of workers for the growing senior-care industry.,2018-03-25T12:00:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","When the Elderly Call for Help, a ‘Chain’ Immigrant Often Answers",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/immigration-labor-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/us/00lowskill-promo/00lowskill-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1

Greta Jochem,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. You probably didn’t give much thought to how exactly you loaded this webpage. Maybe you clicked a link from Twitter or Facebook and presto, this article popped up on your screen. The internet seems magical and intangible sometimes. But the reality is, you rely on physical, concrete objects—like giant data centers and miles of underground cables—to stay connected. All that infrastructure is at risk of being submerged. In just 15 years, roughly 4,000 miles of fiber-optic cables in US coastal cities could go underwater, potentially causing internet outages. That’s the big finding from a new, peer-reviewed study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Oregon. To figure out how rising seas could affect the internet’s physical structures, researchers compared a map of internet infrastructure to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s predictions for sea-level rise near US coasts. In New York City, about 20 percent of fibers distributed throughout the city are predicted to flood within 15 years—along with 32 percent of the fibers that connect the metropolis to other cities and 43 data centers. The research suggests that Seattle and Miami are especially vulnerable, along with many coastal areas. A map of New York City shows a network of cables (green lines) and areas estimated to be underwater in 15 years (blue shaded areas) due to sea-level rise. “All of this equipment is meant to be weather-resistant—but it’s not waterproof,” says Paul Barford, UW-Madison professor of computer science and a coauthor of the paper. Much of the system was put into place in the ’90s without much consideration of climate change, he says. On top of that, much of the internet’s physical infrastructure is aging. Paul Barford says a lot of it was designed to last only a few decades and is now nearing the end of its lifespan. That is, if the floods don’t get to it first. While 15 years may seem shockingly soon, we’re already seeing more high tide flooding, points out Carol Barford (married to the aforementioned Paul), a coauthor on the paper and director of UW-Madison’s Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment. We’re seeing outages related to extreme weather, too: Hurricane Irma, for example, left over a million people without internet access. It’s hard to predict exactly what would happen inland when coastal infrastructure floods—but the internet is an interconnected system, so damage in one place could affect others. For those inland, it’s possible that coastal flooding could cause a total internet connection outage, or issues in connecting to particular web pages and services. Still, there’s a lot of research to be done. “We need to better understand the scope of the problem to create good solutions,” says Ramakrishnan Durairajan, a University of Oregon assistant professor of computer and information sciences and the paper’s lead author. Further studies could examine the effects of increased extreme weather on the system, he says, as well as ways to better engineer web traffic in the face of floods or other climate-induced disasters.

"Emily Lipstein on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","A new interactive climate change exhibit will open at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) this week, becoming the museum’s first permanent installation dedicated to our changing climate. It’s replacing a climate-centric portion of the museum’s Hall of Planet Earth, which features a ton of good rocks and a pretty awesome piece of petrified wood, but is 20 years out of date. Museums are an essential arm of science communication, especially considering their reach (over five million people visited AMNH in 2017). This role comes with the huge responsibility of educating the public on the most important science news, and helping people suss through what’s fact versus BS peddled by special interests. While AMNH has included bits and pieces about climate change in its other exhibits (and had a temporary exhibition on the topic from 2008-2009), it’s playing catch-up with institutions like San Francisco’s California Academy of Sciences—particularly on the climate action front. The new installation includes of a complete renovation of the paleoclimate section of the Hall of Planet Earth, which show how scientists are using everything from corals to ice cores to understand what our planet looked like in the past, and what it may look like in the future. The crown jewel, however, is a feature wall composed of 36 55-inch HD screens. It serves as the centerpiece and overview of the experience, featuring a set of gorgeous Earth images and visualizations depicting our changing climate. The size of the screen dwarves visitors, putting information on how Earth’s climate works and how climate change is impacting our world into stark perspective. The entire thing is visually stunning; it almost feels like the exhibition is there to debut these new technologies within the museum rather than the content itself. That said, the new technology allows the exhibit’s curators to update any of the information that’s displayed as new science becomes available. For instance, much of the imagery on display comes from 2017’s disastrous hurricane season: image sliders depict the British Virgin Islands before and after Hurricane Irma tore through late last summer; a satellite image showing Harvey, Irma, and Jose in various states of formation is one of the many cycling on the large screen. This year’s hurricane season will offer another data point that could be included in future image sets. The place where this is most useful in the exhibit is in the “Warming World” section. It features three data visualizations, all depicting changes in Earth’s temperature on different spatial and temporal scales. As time passes and scientists record new climate data, it has the potential to be incorporated into the visualizations. The most compelling part of the exhibit for me was the interactive showing how climate change creates a cascade of threats. For instance, the exhibit discusses how a climate impact like drought can lead to famine, which can contribute to armed conflict. Rising temperatures of course impact us all, but these cascade effects often feel more urgent and dire. To that end, it surprised me that the exhibit didn’t include anything about taking action against climate change. Of course, AMNH correctly points the blame at man-made greenhouse gas emissions. But beyond a mention of a community in New York City is whitewashing its roofs in the “How Climate Change is Impacting Us Locally” section, there was nothing in the exhibit about how people can and should work to reign in global warming. AMNH has recently come under scrutiny for having concerning connections to the fossil fuel industry and featuring prominent climate change deniers, such as David Koch, on its board of trustees. Although Koch has been gone from the board as of 2016, the negative attention has recently shifted to Rebekah Mercer, whose family’s connections to Breitbart, the Trump Foundation, and the Heartland Foundation cannot be ignored. To AMNH’s credit, these funding conflicts are in no way as apparent as they are in the Koch-funded “Hall of Human Origins” at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Still, for an incredibly modern exhibit that includes such up-to-date data and images, it’s unfortunate that the AMNH’s modernity doesn’t extend to the inclusion of solutions in its climate exhibit. After all, we don’t have the luxury of abstaining from getting political about climate change—it’s always been a political issue, even before Scott Pruitt graced the EPA with his presence. Although there’s an argument to be made that a permanent exhibit in a museum shouldn’t feature newsy information that could quickly change (such as the beliefs and behavior of our elected officials), above all else, a museum’s role is to educate the public. Discussing the realities of our world—messy human politics and all—doesn’t reduce a museum’s credibility. It shows the institution is dedicated to spreading truth, no matter where that truth comes from. We’ve reached out to the AMNH for comment on why it chose not to include more information on policy and solutions in its new climate installation and will update this post when we hear back. The new exhibit opens to the public on Saturday July 7. Admission is included in the price of a normal ticket.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Hurricane Michael may reach category three strength before it arrives in Florida Hurricane Michael has strengthened to a category two storm, with winds reaching in excess of 100mph (155km/h) as it barrels towards the Florida coast. The storm is expected to reach category three strength before it makes landfall on Wednesday. Forecasters say some regions may see 12in (30cm) of rain, and storm surges of up to 12ft (3.6m). Governor Rick Scott warned residents to get out of the way, saying on Tuesday: ""This is a monstrous storm"". Is it expected to crawl up the US East Coast after making landfall in the Gulf Coast, and could bring rains to the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, warned on Tuesday that warm waters will probably further strengthen Michael before it makes landfall. Over 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has cautioned. The agency warned residents in Florida and Alabama of the risk of storm surges, damaging winds and flash flooding. Gov Scott warned in a news conference that Hurricane Michael is a ""massive storm that could bring total devastation to parts of our state, especially in the panhandle"". He added that its predicted to be ""the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.

KAREN ZRAICK,"Giving to the Cajun Navy Numerous volunteer rescue groups go by some variation of Cajun Navy. One registered nonprofit, Cajun Navy Relief, said that its volunteers, who include boaters, EMTs and firefighters, have extensive training and have conducted rescues in previous storms, like Hurricane Harvey last year. As Hurricane Florence approached the Carolinas, the Cajun Navy Relief deployed to an area near Lumberton, N.C., with bass boats, airboats and other vessels, said Josh Richard, a spokesman for the organization. The group has a PayPal account for monetary donations, which are needed to fill fuel containers and buy meals for boat teams and evacuees, among other costs. Go here to donate supplies. Animal shelters Before the storm hit, many local animal shelters scrambled to transport their charges to safe locations, or to get them adopted. The Atlanta Humane Society was caring for dozens of cats and dogs from Beaufort, S.C., and rushed to get other animals in shelters on the Carolina coast out of harm’s way. After Irma last year, the organization put up 1,000 animals in an emergency shelter, and if needed, it could reopen such a facility, said Christina Hill, a spokeswoman for the group. That protects animals in case shelters are damaged, and also frees up space for lost or displaced animals that come in after the storm. (Shelters that reach capacity are sometimes forced to euthanize animals after natural disasters.)","Avair Vereen, 39, left, her fiancé and one of her children at a Hurricane Florence evacuation shelter at Conway High School in South Carolina on Thursday.",2018-09-15T15:43:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence: How to Help,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/reader-center/how-to-help-hurricane-florence-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/15/us/15xp-shelters/15xp-shelters-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1

TIFFANY HSU,"But Chipotle, which has more than 2,400 restaurants, was hobbled in 2015 by case after case of food contamination involving E. coli, salmonella and norovirus. Last year, the company was targeted by hackers, excoriated on social media after a video of rodents in one of its restaurants went viral and pummeled by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. In the past three years, the stock has slumped 63 percent. The company has stumbled over leadership troubles, too. Mr. Ells’s co-chief executive, Montgomery F. Moran, relinquished his position in 2016, and Mr. Ells has been criticized for his hefty compensation. Taco Bell can sympathize. In 2011, the year Mr. Niccol began working at Taco Bell, the company battled a class-action lawsuit that claimed the chain’s seasoned beef taco filling was more filling than beef. The lawsuit was eventually withdrawn, but marketing experts said the company had stumbled by demanding an apology, unintentionally keeping the allegations in the public eye. Mr. Niccol was Taco Bell’s president from 2013 to 2014 and then its chief executive starting in 2015. Under his leadership, the chain was frequently the best-performing subsidiary of Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and KFC. In recent years, Taco Bell has teamed up with Lyft and the GrubHub online delivery service, pledged to remove artificial ingredients from most of its products, experimented with alcohol on the menu and pushed hard into the breakfast market — all moves that have elevated its reputation with the younger consumers who frequent quick-serve establishments. It has also started a more health-conscious menu called Cantina Bell and tested the Chinese market. Taco Bell and its franchisees have more than 7,250 restaurants. After the announcement on Tuesday, Chipotle’s stock rose nearly 12 percent, or nearly $30, to $281 a share. Mr. Niccol will also become a Chipotle board member. Mr. Ells, who said last year that he would step down as chief executive, will become executive chairman.

Lee Yancy,"Last week, two EVE Online players chose to share their life’s happiest moments with the community at EVE Fanfest in Reykjavik, Iceland, where they were joined in holy matrimony by the Space Pope. Tairon Usaro and Irma Amatin, dressed in formal Amaarian cosplay, tied the knot on stage during the Fanfest livestream. The couple met for the first time five years ago, shortly before Tairon was scheduled to fly out to a different Fanfest event, and all through his trip that year he was unable to focus on spaceships. His thoughts kept drifting back home to Germany where he had left the woman who was destined to become his wife. All through the event Tairon shared pictures and stories of EVE and the people he was meeting with Irma, who as a non-player was admittedly more than a little confused at the spectacle. Luckily for Tairon, Irma’s interest in him allowed her to look past what many might consider a non-traditional courtship. Once Tairon returned to Germany, the two quickly began a relationship that would end up drawing Irma into the strange and wondrous world of EVE Online. As the two of them grew together as a couple, their involvement in the community surrounding the game became more and more involved. Together they formed and run the largest German-language player meetup group, G-Fleet. G-Fleet is an annual meetup in Dusseldorf, Germany, thought they will soon be moving to Berlin, which plays host to nearly 200 EVE Online players brought together by their love of the game. During the closing ceremony of last year’s G-Fleet Meetup, after leading the group in their traditional song, Killing is a Means of Communication, Tairon stopped the ceremony, turned to Irma, and proposed to Irma in front of the cheering crowd. “Yeah, I didn’t really think that through all the way,” Tairon recalled while sitting next to his wife at Fanfest after the ceremony. “All of them wanted to line up and congratulate us as we tried to get back to our room.” “We were engaged as part of the community, and we felt it was appropriate to share the wedding as well,” Irma said. The couple admitted that they had actually had a very private official ceremony a few months ago, but wanted to involve their role-playing group at Fanfest, as well as the semi-official religious icon of the EVE world, Max Singularity, AKA the Space Pope. His Holiness Max Singularity, Space Pope of EVE, is a widely recognized figure at EVE Meets. In his other life, he’s Charles White, a knowledge management specialist for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He’s also an ordained priest through the Universal Life Church. In front of his adoring flock, all dressed in cosplay attire based on EVE Amarr empire, White performed the ceremony, projected out over the Fanfest crowd. Cheers went up throughout the crowd as the couple shared their first kiss as a married couple—well, with the marriage officially recognized by the Space Pope, anyway. As everyone cheered the happy couple moved off stage and went to enjoy themselves and relax after sharing a special moment with the guests at Fanfest, and everyone watching the livestream at home.","Last week, two EVE Online players chose to share their life’s happiest moments with the community at EVE Fanfest in Reykjavik, Iceland, where they were joined in holy matrimony by the Space Pope.

WRAL,"By Alfred Charles, Online Managing Editor and Joe Reedy, Associated Press Raleigh, N.C. — Friday marks the official start of the hurricane season and forecasters say it appears that this could be a ""normal"" year after hurricanes Irma and Maria were blamed for several deaths and millions of dollars in damages. ""It's June 1, so here we go,"" said WRAL meteorologist Elizabeth Gardner. ""It's the official start to the hurricane season."" &amp;bullet; Hurricane names for the 2018 Atlantic season The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted a normal to near- or slightly above-normal hurricane season this year with 10-16 named storms likely to develop. The tally for a normal year is 12 named storms, Gardner said. She said there are two factors that will determine the number of hurricanes: Sea-surface temps. Gardner said if ocean temperature hits 80 degrees or higher then that will increase the chances for more hurricanes. ""The warmer the temperatures are, the more storms we'll see,"" Gardner said. El Nino. The extended forecast calls for an el Nino system, which will mean more wind shear in the upper levels of the atmosphere. But Gardner cautioned that the system will be weak so that could mean a minimal effect on hurricane formation. The hurricane season last year culminated with 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes. The Atlantic basin annually averages 12 named storms, with six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. &amp;bullet; 2018 hurricane season could be as busy as 2017 NOAA added that there is a 75 percent chance that the 2018 season will see near or more than the average number of storms in the basin. Florida preps for hurricane season Florida's governor and Legislature promised a dizzying array of fixes following the devastation of last year's hurricanes. But heading into a new storm season, the state has enacted only a few changes — the largest aimed at protecting seniors in nursing homes. &amp;bullet; Looming hurricane season a reminder that NC must do more to mitigate flood risk Friday's official start of hurricane season also arrives as the state continues to feel the effects of two storms last year. Hurricane Irma ripped across the state last September and was blamed for 84 deaths in Florida, as well as over $8.6 billion in property damage. Hurricane Maria, which decimated Puerto Rico last October, led to mass relocations to the Sunshine State. After having no significant storms from 2006 to 2015, three storms have made landfall in the state the past two years. ""As hard as it was last year, people worked together well,"" Gov. Rick Scott said recently at the Governor's Hurricane Conference in West Palm Beach. ""I think almost everyone is pleased with debris removal, but it is the rebuilding that takes time."" The Florida House of Representative's Select Committee on Hurricane Response and Preparedness issued 78 recommendations over the past year, with 27 being acted upon, mostly as appropriations in the state budget. The recommendations ranged from ensuring generators and three days of fuel in nursing homes and assisted living facilities to creating a disaster preparedness sales tax holiday. Priorities for most people remain ensuring access to fuel and transportation, following a massive and chaotic evacuation during Irma that left residents scrambling for fuel and clogging Florida's highways. Scott directed the state's Department of Transportation to better identify larger gas stations along evacuation routes and improve delivery of fuel to those areas. Legislators recommended having the state consider using one-way traffic flows on major highways, but Scott, citing state transportation officials, instead backed the use of highway shoulders to relieve congestion. Authorities allowed drivers to use shoulders several times during Irma. Craig Fugate, who was the state's top emergency official under Gov. Jeb Bush and later headed FEMA under President Barack Obama, said one way to ease congestion during evacuations is pointing people to shelters closer to their homes. ""If you look at last year we had a lot of people driving long distances. We have so many new residents that we forgot past lessons,"" he said. ""How do you keep them engaged and prepared and pass on the lessons that we learned the hard way between the quiet and active periods?"" One way could be through improvements in forecasting from the National Hurricane Center. Director Ken Graham said new public advisories are ""absolutely huge"" for the work emergency managers do ahead of any storm. Those include the expected time for tropical storm-force winds to arrive onshore and maps that show possible storm surge. ""It's about understanding the risk, it's understanding if you're in an evacuation zone, and understanding you may not have far to go to get away from that risk,"" Graham said. The state also has named a new top emergency management official, Wes Maul, following the resignation after seven years of Bryan Koon, who said he would return to the private sector. Maul served as the department's chief of staff for 17 months but had no other prior emergency management experience. Maul declined to answer questions about his level of experience, but the governor's office has cited Maul's work at the department so far — including responses to storms and mass shootings — as an indicator that Maul is up to the task. The governor is confident in Maul, Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis said. Graham said his office's job with any new officials ""is going to be to educate.... We're going to spend time spinning them up on the hurricane season, spinning them up on the science."" Scott, a Republican, is leaving office due to term limits. Florida has not been hit with a hurricane the year of a gubernatorial election since 1964. The state's response during a storm could quickly become a campaign issue for governor and the U.S. Senate as Scott is challenging three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in November. Fugate said no matter the year — or the stakes — the mission remains the same. ""They have to be ready for stuff you would expect, but also be prepared for what could happen,"" he said. ""We have our planning assumptions, but you also have to adjust to what the public is doing."" ___ Associated Press writer Jennifer Kay in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, ALAN BLINDER and PATRICIA MAZZEI","But the storm intensified far more than unexpected overnight, and by sunrise on Wednesday, the winds had reached 140 miles per hour. Later they were even higher, reaching 155 miles per hour just two miles per hour short of Category 5 strength by landfall. The shear was high, so nobody expected it was going to intensify this rapidly, said Haiyan Jiang, an associate professor at Florida International University who studies tropical cyclones. The storm was the first major hurricane a storm with winds of at least 111 miles per hour to make landfall in the continental United States since Hurricane Irma last year. That storm, which struck a different part of Florida, caused an estimated $50 billion in damage and was cited in 92 deaths. The storms rapid intensification gave emergency officials and residents little time to prepare. When they started a couple of days ago and said it was going to be a Category 1, it was, like, Cat 1, no big deal, Laurie Hamm said at the Panama City hotel where she had taken refuge a few miles from her townhouse nearer the beach. When they said Cat 2, it was like, Oh, maybe wed better pay attention. And when they said Cat 3, it was like, Oh, Lord. The rains had already started pounding on Wednesday morning when people lined up in the cafeteria at Lincoln High School in Tallahassee to seek shelter.

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"Prof. Michael E. Mann of Penn State told me that Hurricane Michael should be a wake-up call. As should have Katrina, Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Florence, he added wryly. In each of these storms we can see the impact of climate change: Warmer seas means more energy to intensify these storms, more wind damage, bigger storm surge and more coastal flooding. As recently as the early 2000s, there wasnt much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change. Yet in the following years Al Gore helped make climate change a Democratic issue, and the Koch brothers helped make climate denial a litmus test of Republican authenticity. Tribalism took over, and climate skepticism became part of the Republican creed. So polls show that today climate denial is far greater in the United States, home to the greatest scientific research in the world, than in just about any other major country. Trump says he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and he had nothing substantive to say about a new United Nations report, which has been called a deafening, piercing smoke alarm of catastrophic consequences ahead from climate change. Republicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and its irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet. There are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.","Hurricane Michael hit Port St. Joe, Fla., with full force on Wednesday.",2018-10-10T23:24:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The ‘Greatest Hoax’ Strikes Florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/opinion/climate-change-hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/opinion/10kristofSub/10kristofSub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
Laila Kearney,"FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla (Reuters) - Down the palm tree-lined roads of northeast Florida’s Flagler County, a half-dozen dump trucks are shuttling back and forth along the Atlantic coast pouring thousands of tons of sand onto the local beach. Replacing sand swept away by waves and wind is critical work to protect seaside homes and businesses as well as the tourism dollars brought by northerners seeking refuge from the cold in the Sunshine State. Getting enough of it, for the right price and in time for the peak tourist season, has become much harder after a violent storm year that brought Irma, the most powerful hurricane to hit the state in over a decade, and saddled Florida with more than $50 billion in damage. Costs of so-called beach renourishments are a fraction of the total, measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, but the effort is crucial for Florida's $67 billion tourism industry. And while sand needs are surging, there is not enough to go around. ( tmsnrt.rs/2BIyPFs ) “It’s like the slow progression of tooth decay versus a fight where someone knocks out your teeth all at once,” Flagler County Administrator Craig Coffey said, referring to sand lost during Irma and Hurricane Matthew, which buffeted Florida’s coast in October 2016. With the longest coastline of any mainland U.S. state, more money and time is spent fixing up Florida’s shores - widening and building dunes - than in any other state. [L2N1PR2CK] But after seven decades of rebuilding its beaches, the state is now struggling with sand shortages, rising costs and tight public funds even during calmer years. The quick succession of powerful storms makes the challenges even more daunting. By one estimate, based on a sample of beaches, Irma knocked out four times the amount of sand Matthew displaced, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman John Campbell said. Matthew was already considered one of the worst storms in recent memory. As weather patterns change and coastal development increases, more states have rolled out programs to counter beach erosion over the past five years. Other nations, including Mexico, Britain and Australia, also regularly fix up their shores. High demand for sand in the construction industry further strains global supply. As needs and costs rise in Florida, communities are increasingly competing both for sand and funding, with some retaining “sand lobbyists” to represent them in state and federal legislatures. Flagler County tried for more than a decade to get the federal sand funds used for popular beaches like Miami before turning to local tax dollars, private money and emergency aid to rebuild dunes and protect neighborhoods flooded in Matthew, Irma and several nor‘easters since. The estimated $26 million project began late last month. SOARING PRICES AND TURTLES A lone beachcomber and a pair of seagulls walk near dredging equipment on a blustery day at St. Augustine Beach along the Atlantic Coast of Florida, U.S., January 26, 2018. REUTERS/Gregg Newton That back-to-back strike of storms has pushed counties to reach for sand sources all at once, driving up prices. South of Flagler, Brevard County wanted to expand a contract it awarded after Matthew to also cover post-Irma needs at the original price, but the contractor rejected the deal. New bids came in 11 percent to 39 percent higher and the county settled for the lowest offer, said County Commissioner John Tobia, who wants some of the local tax money spent on sand to be used repairing the county’s damaged roads instead. Brevard, home to Kennedy Space Center, also has to worry about sea turtles. Federally-protected sea turtles nest along Florida’s east coast and the laws prohibit any work during the nesting period from May through October. Environmental rules also prescribe what type of sand can be used, since its color affects the temperature - the darker, the faster it warms - and that in turn can change the gender of the turtles before hatching. As useable offshore sand sources get depleted and tapping into new sites involves lengthy permitting, more local governments are trucking sand from mines - instead of dredging it from the seabed and piping it onshore - even though it can cost five times more per cubic yard. “With the shrinking sand supply, it leads to conflict,” said Dave Bullock, who retired last month as town manager for Florida’s western barrier island of Longboat Key, which used up the rest of its offshore reserves after Matthew. In a recent example of that clash, two neighboring beach communities, Siesta Key and Lido Key are facing off in a lawsuit over which can claim 1.8 million tons of sand from a common boating channel. Environmental advocates argue that beach erosion is primarily a natural phenomenon and efforts to reverse it create a vicious-circle by encouraging building along the shore. That in turn puts more people and public resources at risk and calls for greater efforts and money to protect them. The long-term, lasting solution would be to roll back coastal development, environmental activists argue. Still, needs are likely to grow, says Derek Brockbank, executive director at the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, which lobbies for coastal governments and businesses. Climate change and coastal development have created an urgent need to protect the upland, Brockbank said, calling for $5 billion to be set aside over the next decade in any upcoming federal infrastructure bill.

Sruthi Ramakrishnan,"Dollar General beat on both the top and bottom lines. Comparable sales rose 4.3% versus a year ago, boosted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. (Reuters) - Dollar General Corp on Thursday reported better-than-expected comparable sales for the third quarter, as hurricanes led to increased traffic and higher spending at its stores. Sales at stores open for at least a year rose 4.3 percent, beating the average analysts' estimate of 2.8 percent growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The retailer said Hurricanes Harvey and Irma contributed 30-35 basis points to comparable sales growth, while hurting profit by 5 cents per share in the reported quarter. Except for the second quarter, traffic at Dollar General stores declined over the last year, partly due to reduced food stamp coverage in several U.S. states. This is the first full quarter after a year of food stamp cuts, which began in April 2016. Net income rose to $252.5 million, or 93 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, from $235.3 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 98 cents per share, beating the average analysts' estimate of 94 cents. Net sales rose 11 percent to $5.90 billion, beating estimates of $5.80 billion.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"That absurd figure, and that condescension, are what make the study by independent researchers from Harvard and other institutions, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, so needed. After surveying random households across the island and comparing mortality rates they encountered to those before Maria, they came up with an estimated 4,645 additional deaths through the end of the year — a third of them people who died for lack of medical care. Puerto Rico has now commissioned its own study. But the very fact that the official toll was so obviously wrong reflects the disdain that has permeated the response to Maria. A death toll is a critical measure of the scale of a catastrophe, shaping both the public and official response. There is no telling how many lives could have been saved had the federal government been aware of the carnage rather than patting itself on the back. As Mayor Cruz, a sharp critic of the Trump administration’s response, said in an interview in March, Hurricane Maria opened Puerto Rican eyes “to our inequity — and our inequality.” The island, a commonwealth of the United States whose people are American citizens, remains in need of help. Parts of the island are still without electricity, thousands of residents lack shelter, and much remains in ruins. As many as 135,000 Puerto Ricans have left for the states. As reporters for The Times wrote in a major report in early May, after Maria and a preceding hurricane called Irma, “Puerto Rico all but slipped from the modern era.” When confronted with the Harvard study, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, responded with more self-congratulation, claiming that the government had responded to Maria with the largest Federal Emergency Management Agency effort ever. Yet what Puerto Rico really needs to recover is the sort of generous, urgent and long-term assistance that would come with a recognition by the states that a great calamity has befallen their fellow Americans, that these people dying from a lack of the most basic services are their countrymen, their responsibility.","A new study points to a far higher death toll from Hurricane Maria, more evidence of the Trump administration’s neglect.",2018-06-03T23:45:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Shame in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/opinion/puerto-rico-hurricane-deaths.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/opinion/04mon2sub/04mon2sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
ELISA GABBERT,"The phrase “I do,” in the context of a marriage ceremony, is what linguists call a “performative utterance” — words that don’t simply mean or imply but actually enact a change. There are some words powerful enough that, when a president utters them, we might think they amount to a performative utterance, too: For the chief executive to call something a “disaster” in public, for instance, might suggest that a formal disaster declaration will follow. Except lately. During the Oct. 9, 2016, presidential debate, the candidate Donald Trump said “disaster” 17 times. The 17 things that Trump characterized as disasters were, in order: inner cities, Obamacare, single-payer health care plans, Obamacare, Obamacare, Iraq, taxes, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton again, Libya, Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy record, Aleppo, Nafta, Nafta, education, Hillary Clinton’s political performance in upstate New York and jobs. Since that night, he has used the word “disaster” on Twitter with slightly less frequency — just 31 times. Last year there was a record-breaking pileup of multibillion-dollar “megadisasters,” including wildfires, tornadoes and flooding, but only three of the president’s tweets referred to such events. “Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.,” he wrote in one, after Hurricane Irma. “A real disaster, much work to do!” The oddly cheerful tone of this tweet aside, the word “real” was an interesting addition, a seeming acknowledgment of the distance between a true disaster and Trump’s preferred, mostly rhetorical usage, which designates its recipient as a laughable mess, a high-profile embarrassment. Merriam-Webster does offer two contemporary definitions for disaster. One is “a sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or destruction,” as in “natural disasters.” The other is more hyperbolic, in the Trumpian sense: “a sudden or great misfortune or failure,” as in (the dictionary’s example) “The party was a disaster.” This second flavor leaves plenty of room for subjective evaluation of the failure in question. It puts disaster in the eye of the beholder.",It has little to do with lives lost or damage done — and everything to do with the stories we want to tell about ourselves.,2018-04-10T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",First Words: What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True ‘Disaster’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/what-separates-ordinary-bad-news-from-true-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/magazine/15mag-firstwords/15mag-15firstwords-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
Jack Stewart,"More than a million people have been told to leave their homes, get away from the coast and low lying areas, and get to safety, as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas and Virginia. But a new group of temporary, risk-taking, residents is getting ready to ride out the storm. Drone pilots are watching forecasts, and staging in areas where they’ll be safe, but useful, ready to rush into action as soon as possible, as a now vital part of the disaster response. “When we’re pre-deployed, we have our rations—it’s an ongoing joke of beef jerky and pretzels,” says Hadley Doyle-González, who runs SMG Drones, in Palm Beach, Florida. “We have a ridiculous amount of batteries,” she says. “We need to be able to fly for 24 hours with no power.” During Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida this time last year, she was deployed to Naples, and holed up in a hotel. She made sure all her equipment was in waterproof cases and moved her car to higher ground. When the winds died down, she headed out to capture high resolution images of houses, buildings, or utilities, which can show damage early, and get help and repairs, as well as insurance money, to where it's needed. “You’re charging every battery you have to the nth degree,” says Craig Besse, flight ops manager for Airbus Aerial, who was also deployed in Irma's aftermath. You need 20 to 30 gallons of water per person, and to make sure your truck is loaded with food, water, and fuel. “Get that last shower in,” he says, before supplies are cut off. Then, it’s about being flexible. “It’s not going to go the way you expected.” LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones As Hurricane Florence continues its unstoppable march toward the Atlantic coast, both Besse and Doyle-González are managing teams of drone pilots and going through those same final preparations. They are just a few of the expected thousands of drones and pilots getting ready to fly over the damage left by the storm. When Florence hits the coast, it will bring torrential downpours, wind blasts, coastal erosion, and the possibility of a storm surge of seawater causing flooding. The National Hurricane Center has predicted ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall."" Accuweather is warning that the angle at which the storm will impact the coast—nearly perpendicular—means the winds on the east side will be particularly effective at driving waves, and that surge, onto shore. It’s predicting $60 billion in economic impact and damage. Air travel, of course, will be disrupted. The FAA says to expect flight cancellations and airport closures. Air traffic controllers will evacuate tall towers in extreme winds, but stay on duty on a lower, secure level. Airport workers will disable airport surveillance radar antennas so they spin freely, to save them from wind damage, and get up and running as quickly as possible once the threat has passed. The assembled drone pilots, though, won't wait for commercial aviation to restart before they take off. Insurance companies are the biggest clients for their services, so they can figure out where to send resources, and in some cases, to settle claims within hours. Utility companies employ drone pilots to spot downed power lines. Infrastructure engineers can see flooded roads. And they can do it all long before it's possible or safe to reach these areas on the ground. At the Airbus Aerial headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, Jesse Kallman, president of the imaging company, has taken over a conference room, with a team of 10. Together they’re putting well prepared plans into action, to combine data from Airbus’ satellites, fixed wing aircraft, and drones. Insurance companies are sending over databases of where their policy holders are concentrated. Utilities are spelling out where they have vulnerable infrastructure like long power lines. The company is also pulling together pre-event data: ""before” pictures to contrast with the “after.” Getting those “after” images is the challenge. No aircraft can fly in the storm itself, and even when it passes, they have to get into place to start work. “We work with the satellite team to try to understand the optimal times to acquire data, and work through all the types of data needed,” says Kallman. A detailed understanding of the path of the storm can give them a head start. “Once the weather clears, we want to be prepared to get planes and drones up in the air,” says Jonathan Gadd, who manages drone and planes at EagleView, another imaging company, for which Doyle-González is subcontracting. It’s not just quadcopters that can be useful. Small, manned planes can also cover more distance, but at a greater cost. EagleView is working to stage 15 fixed-wing aircraft in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida. Planes are not only useful for supplementing drones for image capture, particularly on long runs, but they’re also crucial for transport. EagleView’s pilots can act as couriers, flying into affected areas, collecting hard drives of video and image data, and flying them to HQ in Rochester, New York. Drone operators train for this type of work, and know enough to stay out of the way of first responders. The FAA is appealing to amateurs to do the same. Professional drone pilots can apply for emergency certificates of operation from the sky safety regulator if they need to work in areas that have been blanketed with temporary flight restrictions. Combining this bird's eye view with some clever computing lets insurance agencies move faster than ever before, like Allstate did after Hurricane Irma. “We had a customer in Orlando, and we called him, and said we believe your roof has damage,” says spokesperson Justin Herndon. “That was before he filed a claim.” The man had money in his bank account within five hours. Well after the storm has gone, drones can help with the heavy lifting. In hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico last year, utilities used drones to restring downed power lines in hard to access areas. But now, America's drone pilots are lying in wait for Florence's rage. “This one’s supposed to linger—it’s going to be a lot slower of a go time than what we’re used to,” says Doyle-González. Teams will have to spend more like 48 hours surviving on their jerky and pretzels, sitting and waiting, sleeping while they can. Then they’ll be ready to start work—even if it means a few days before their next shower.

GLENN THRUSH,"This is the most severe weather anyone here has ever seen, Ms. Cox said. We have got to find a way to talk to people about whats happening. Im not sure how to do that.

Farmers and state officials in Georgia, Florida and Alabama are still trying to assess the damage done by Michael, which had the strongest sustained winds of any storm to hit the Southeast since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. But the destruction is already believed to be on a scale not previously seen in Georgia, a $65 billion-a-year agricultural powerhouse. The states total losses, clustered in the southwest, could top $2.5 billion, according to Gary W. Black, the state agriculture commissioner. The cotton crop this year could be a near total loss, with damage estimated at between $300 billion and $800 billion. Crop insurance will cover a fraction of that damage, in part because payouts are calculated on a 10-year average yield kept low by the damage done by Hurricane Irma last year, said Plenn Hunnicutt, an executive with South Georgia Crop Insurance.

WASHINGTON FEMA improperly shared the personal data of some 2.3 million victims from four major 2017 disasters, a government watchdog report concluded.

FEMA is a division of Homeland Security.

The breach occurred because proper safeguards were not taken for disaster victims who participated in FEMA's program to provide transitional shelter to survivors left homeless, often placing them in hotels and other temporary lodging arrangements, the report said.
The type of information compromised included full names, birth dates, partial social security numbers, addresses and financial information. The data was provided to a private contractor managing the transitional shelter program.

That tempest caused widespread devastation in the greater Houston area. The slow movement of Harvey from Aug. 26-30 contributed to the destructive and deadly floods in southeast Texas. The most rain fell in Nederland, Texas, which received more than 60 inches of rain from Aug. 24-Sept.1. The flooding in the region displaced 30,000 people and damaged or destroyed more than 200,000 homes and businesses.

In a March 8 letter to Kelly included in the audit, FEMA Associate Administrator Joel Doolin acknowledged the breach and said the agency ""has taken aggressive action to mitigate the issues raised within this report.""
Doolin's letter says the agency ""acted immediately to stop the flow of excess data"" of personally sensitive information as soon as it received the Inspector General's draft report in November.
The four disasters in 2017 left tens of thousands homeless and caused billions in damage.

Catie Keck,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency may have put the personally identifying information of millions of disaster survivors at risk of fraud and identity theft, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General.
The March 15 report said that during an audit of FEMAs Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, it found that the agency shared and subsequently exposed the personal data of 2.3 million survivors of a number of natural disasters that included the 2017 California wildfires as well as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Survivors of these incidents provided their private information to FEMA in order to obtain assistance such as temporary housing. The audit found that FEMA jeopardized private information that the agency collected about applicants when it unnecessarily released some of that information to an undisclosed contractor handling its TSA program.
FEMA, the report stated, shared with the contractor more than 20 unnecessary data fields for survivors participating in the TSA program, including bank names, account numbers, and home addresses.
FEMA Press Secretary Lizzie Litzow told Gizmodo in a statement by email on Friday that since becoming aware of the issue, the agency has has taken aggressive measures to correct this error, including by conducting its own audit of the contractors information system. Litzow also said FEMA is no longer sharing what the OIG identified as unnecessary information with the contractor.
To date, FEMA has found no indicators to suggest survivor data has been compromised, Litzow said. FEMA has also worked with the contractor to remove the unnecessary data from the system and updated its contract to ensure compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cybersecurity and information-sharing standards. As an added measure, FEMA instructed contracted staff to complete additional DHS privacy training.
A DHS official who spoke with the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said that it did not have information that any data had been compromised. He did, however, tell the Post that the banking information of 1.8 million individuals had been exposed in the breach, with roughly three-quarters of a million addresses also exposed.
The agency said Friday its goal remains protecting and strengthening the integrity, effectiveness, and security of our disaster programs that help people before, during, and after disasters.

Katie Kindelan,"A Tennessee couple is opening their home to what could be dozens of hurricane evacuees for the second year in a row. After hearing that hundreds of thousands of residents along the Southeast coast were ordered to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Florence this week, Leah and Dan Bolton took to Facebook. The Kingsport, Tennessee, couple posted that anyone fleeing the storm is welcome to stay not only in their home, but also the trampoline park they own ""if people just need a place to lay their heads."" The Boltons, the parents of three teenagers, have been through this drill before. Last year, they hosted 26 people in their four-bedroom home when Hurricane Irma swept through Florida. Leah Bolton (standing, fifth from right) opened her home in Tennessee to 26 people evacuating from 2017's Hurricane Irma. The evacuees were friends of friends and the number of them kept growing as hotels and motels north of Florida quickly filled up. ""[My friend] started getting phone calls and texts on the drive up and she’d call me and say, 'Leah, I have four more people who need a place,'"" Leah Bolton recalled. ""And I’d say, 'Bring them up too.'"" Hurricane Irma evacuees gather in the kitchen of Leah and Dan Bolton's Tennessee house. This year, the Boltons are welcoming anyone, including complete strangers, who need a place to stay. ""That’s how we were raised. You open up your home and just hope that everyone stays safe,"" Leah Bolton said. ""If we ever thought we were in danger, we wouldn’t do it."" Hurricane Florence has prompted evacuations from Georgia to Virginia. The hurricane is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges and rainfall. Residents evacuate from coastal areas near Wallace, N.C., Sept. 11, 2018. The Boltons don’t know exactly how many people will ask to seek shelter at their home, but they don’t plan to turn anyone away. ""We’ve had people calling and no one is canceling,"" said Leah Bolton, whose home is about a six-hour drive from the Carolina coast where the hurricane is expected to make landfall. Hurricane Irma evacuees eat a meal together during their time staying at Leah and Dan Bolton's Tennessee house. Their teenage children stepped up to do laundry and put fresh sheets on beds as soon as they heard evacuees were on their way, according to Leah Bolton. During Irma, the Boltons' neighbors also stepped up to help, bringing over food and extra matresses.

Mark Kaufman,"The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1. Currently spinning off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, forecasters named the subtropical storm ""Alberto,"" which is the first of 21 names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has on its list of possible storm names for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. On Friday, Alberto met the minimum requirements for earning a name, having reached sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states both this weekend and into early next week, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA. A storm needs to hit sustained wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour to be considered a Category 1 storm, the least intense hurricane classification. Yesterday, the National Hurricane Center released its 2018 hurricane forecast, and they expect 2018 to be an ""active season,"" with between 10 to 16 named storms, five to nine of which being hurricanes. ""This is a fair amount of activity we’re expecting."" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. Tropical Storm conditions associated with #Alberto are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through Saturday. Tropical Storm conditions could reach the northern Gulf Coast as early as Sunday morning. pic.twitter.com/MImTcKhB2z — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) May 25, 2018 Last hurricane season — which produced the immensely destructive hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — was exceptionally active, said Bell, who doesn't currently expect this season to produce such intense activity. Hurricane forecasters analyze a combination of short and long-term climate trends, along with sophisticated computer models when making their predictions for a hurricane season. Since 1995, the Atlantic and Caribbean have seen ""very active"" seasons, said Bell, as a decades-long climate trend in the Atlantic Ocean has kept water temperatures warmer, contributing to a higher number of storms. In addition to this effect, NASA says that modern storm research shows hurricanes are getting stronger, lasting longer, and dumping significantly more rain. Rising sea levels, an indisputable result of human-induced climate change, exacerbates the effect of already damaging storms by producing higher surges of water. As for Alberto, the National Hurricane Service recommends that Gulf Coast residents watch for the agency's regular updates, found easily on either their homepage or Twitter account.","The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1.

"USA TODAY, Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY","Last Slide Next Slide Oceans Edge Key West Hotel and Marina was one of many Florida resorts that had to undergo repairs after Hurricane Irma. It's been a year since the Florida hit. (Photo: Oceans Edge Key West Hotel and Marina) Hurricane Irma, which hit the mainland USA on Sept. 10 last year, cost Florida $1.5 billion in visitor spending and 1.8 million visitors. But hotel and tourism officials say the state is rebounding. According to VISIT FLORIDA, the state’s tourism bureau, an estimated 34.9 million out-of-state visitors arrived in the state in the final four months of 2017. In June, Governor Rick Scott announced that Florida welcomed a record 33.2 million visitors in the first quarter of 2018. That is a 7.4 percent increase over the same period in 2017. The most affected part of Florida was Monroe County, which includes Key West and the other keys in the 125-mile long island chain. The Keys are getting new airlift. Beginning Oct. 4, United Airlines will increase daily non-stop service from Newark Liberty International Airport to Key West from seasonal to year-round. During peak travel season from February through May, United will add a second daily flight. United is also increasing service from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. On Dec. 24, American Airlines will resume nonstop winter and spring service into Key West from Dallas–Fort Worth, operating daily flights through April 1. Hotels renovate Lodging inventory in the Florida Keys is just more than 90 percent operational from pre-hurricane levels, according to the Florida Keys Tourism Council. Nearly all resorts that were closed by Irma are projected to be fully open before the end of 2018. Hawks Cay Resort in Duck Key re-opened Aug. 30 after a $50 million renovation of its lobby, restaurants, 177 guestrooms, and public areas. The resort has two new restaurants and an expanded adults-only area. Oceans Edge Key West Resort Hotel and Marina originally opened in January 2017. The resort sustained minor damage to its 20 acres due to the hurricane. For instance, some rooms had some flooding through the front doors. Key locks had to be replaced. Carpet damaged by water caused the need to bring in tile. Some dry wall had to be removed. A hurricane plate was installed in front of each door designed to stop the impact of wind and rain. “We were up and running by early October, but given that there was so little business coming to the Keys post-storm we took a little longer making certain that our property was maintained to the condition at which we opened a year prior,” says Tom Elwood, general manager of Oceans Edge. That said, Elwood acknowledged that booking levels have not risen to pre-Irma levels. “Our hotel has done much better (year over year) in occupancy post storm, but it is not where we anticipated the market to be,” he says. He urges people to visit the Keys. “It looks better than it did pre-storm,” he says. “Any old debris has been washed away and cleaned up and particularly Key West is looking refreshed and the locals are eager to continue to welcome back tourists.” Cheeca Lodge and Spa in Islamorada re-opened in March after a $25 million renovation. The storm destroyed the resort’s 525-foot fishing pier, a symbol of Cheeca Lodge. The framework of the lodge remained structurally intact, though there was damage to sheet rock, contents of the rooms, elevators, and the data cables. “Everything electrical was considered compromised,” says Bob LaCasse, general manager for Cheeca Lodge and Spa. “There’s a saying: ‘When in doubt, rip it out,’ and that’s what we did. We started from scratch.” The resort now has a new lobby lounge and a new family-friendly dining concept called Mia Cucina. Later this year, an expanded oceanfront pool area and Tiki Bar named South 25 will debut. Guestrooms also have a new design. LaCasse says to strengthen the property for future hurricanes, the resort’s wastewater treatment plant was relocated to higher ground. Windows and sliding doors were replaced with high-impact rated materials. Outdoor air-conditioner units were raised to avoid surge intrusion. The Keys will also get new hotels. Isla Bella Beach Resort will debut in early 2019 in Knights Key in Marathon, at the threshold of the iconic Seven Mile Bridge. Developed by Pritam Singh and The Singh Company’s, the first full-service hotel in Marathon sits on 24 acres. It will have 199 guestrooms, a nearly one-mile private beach, a full-service spa, four dining spots, five swimming pools, a marketplace, fishing pier, and marina. Singh says Florida has always been resilient. Since Hurricane Andrew struck in August 1992, building codes have become stricter. “Hurricane Andrew was the pivotal event and ever since then the buildings are getting stronger and stronger,” Singh says. “At some point, the damage becomes a lot less. You just run out of buildings built in the 40s, 50s and 60s. The flood insurance is kind of an urban renewal project.” Singh says developers learn from each storm. For instance, they now have better generators and satellite phones for when cell phone towers are downed. In terms of landscaping, they only use salt-tolerant plants. “There are plants that are lovely but they are not salt-tolerant, so we’re not putting them in,” he says. “We’re all getting smarter.” The Keys’ first all- or “luxury- inclusive” adults-only resort is set to be unveiled later this year in Key Largo. Bungalows Key Largo will have 135 stand-alone units, two pools, several restaurants and bars. Also in Key Largo, the new 200-room Baker’s Cay Resort, a Curio Collection by Hilton, is scheduled to open by late fall. It’s the Keys’ first Curio property. Attractions re-open All 10 Keys state parks are open for day use as restoration efforts continue. On Big Pine Key, a new 1,840-square-foot Florida Keys National Wildlife Refuges Nature Center is under construction near mile marker 30.5. When it debuts in late fall, this center will showcase the Keys’ four national wildlife refuges with exhibits and a nature bookstore operated by the Florida Keys Wildlife Society.

THOMAS KAPLAN,"Photo Damage from Hurricane Maria in Utuado, Puerto Rico, was still visible last week. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. Credit Alvin Baez/Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief from this year’s devastating hurricanes but urged lawmakers to make spending cuts to offset disaster costs that are now approaching $100 billion. The White House request for more disaster relief after the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, set up a possible confrontation over whether Congress must to find spending cuts to pay for relief even as President Trump pushes for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. White House officials suggested a raft of cuts to pay for the relief, including $730 million from the Army Corps of Engineers’ operations, maintenance, flood control and coastal emergencies funds, $196 million from the Department of Agriculture’s rural economic development program, and $72 million from the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The State Department’s Democracy Fund would lose $99 million and the Department of Transportation highway aid to states would lose $1 billion. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, immediately rebuked the White House over its requests to offset the funding. “Just one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement. “Holding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.” Republicans have been conspicuously quiet about their concerns over adding to the ballooning national debt. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Forecasters say the hurricane will certainly hit the US coastline Evacuations have been ordered as the US East Coast braces for Hurricane Florence - in what may be the strongest storm to hit the region in two decades. South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency, and residents are stocking up on essential supplies. Officials say Florence is now a category three storm with 115mph (183km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - could reach category four as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category three storm to hit the region since Fran ravaged North Carolina 1996. It would be the first East Coast hurricane since Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The National Weather Service warned it may be ""an extremely dangerous major hurricane"" by the time it made landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption International Space Station by astronaut Ricky Arnold took this photo of Florence on 6 September The Miami-based NHC said: ""There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds."" The agency called Florence an ""extremely dangerous"" weather event. ""Somebody is going to suffer devastating damage if this storm continues as it is currently forecast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Miller told The State newspape r in South Carolina. States of emergency North Carolina officials on Monday ordered residents to evacuate the state's Outer Banks barrier islands.

In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper waived agricultural transportation restrictions in order to allow farmers to move goods more quickly. ""During harvest, time is of the essence. Action today can avoid losses due to Florence."" Red flag warnings are keeping swimmers off beaches, as residents sandbag their homes in the communities of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, and the Outer Banks in North Carolina. ""Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,"" Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. Naval preparations Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world, is preparing to send ships away from bases to weather the storm out at sea. Two other hurricanes are currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are expected to accelerate over the next several hours, but at this point, are not expected to threaten the US mainland. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""

"kloria@techinsider.io (Kevin Loria), Kevin Loria","NOAA/NASA Goddard Rapid Response Team The end of November marks the official end of Atlantic hurricane season — 97% of tropical cyclone activity occurs in the six-month between June and November. That's a relief after an intense few months of destructive storms. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was a top-10 hurricane season by most metrics. It set a few all-time records as well. The chart below shows how 2017 stacks up to other years, thanks to data collected by meteorologists at Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project. How Atlantic storms in 2017 compare to other seasons on major metrics. Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project The season was ""extremely active"", to use the National Hurricane Center's technical term. In an ""extremely active"" year, storms have to generate at least 152.5 units of accumulated cyclone energy — a measure of storm intensity, duration, and frequency. 2017 hit 226, mostly due to storms in August and September, when Harvey, Irma, and Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean and US. An ""extremely active"" season also has to meet two out of these three conditions: 13 or more named storms, seven or more hurricanes, and three or more major hurricanes. We hit all three, with 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. Puerto Rico is still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit the island since 1928. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Here are some of the all-time records set this year, according to CSU: September broke all-time records for the number of storm days, hurricane days, and major hurricane days. There were 40.25 hurricane days, since the days of each storm are counted separately. September 8 set the one-day record for accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), thanks the combined forces of Hurricanes Irma, Jose, and Katia. September also broke the record for most ACE in a month. Irma's maximum sustained wind speed of 185 mph made it the strongest storm that's ever existed in the Atlantic, outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. (Including those regions, it's the second strongest after Allen, which reached 190 mph). Irma set a record for maintaining that same intensity for 37 hours, longer than any other storm on the globe. Harvey broke the record for most rainfall from a tropical cyclone in the US, with more than 60 inches of rain falling at two measuring stations in Southeast Texas. This was the first known year that two Category 4 storms made landfall in the continental US: Irma and Harvey. Maria was the first Category 5 storm to hit Dominica and the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. Overall, it was a rough year — one that exceeded forecasters' expectations, even though most called for an above-average season. The exact factors that made it so active are still under investigation, though warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures likely played a role, since that allows storms to pick up intensity.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"For Mr. Rosselló, the funding fight is a question of fairness. For every long-term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria, there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey, and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the governor said. Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States.
A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long four months for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid (about $1 billion) as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida, though Maria was stronger and more devastating. Maria killed an estimated 2,975 people in Puerto Rico.
In addition to the slow disbursement of aid, a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants, including $20 billion approved for Puerto Rico.
In Vieques, with the hospital out of commission, dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm. Several patients died. Finally, in November, a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic, allowing local treatments to resume.
It wasnt easy, said Edwin Alvarado Cordero, a 58-year-old diabetic. Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the islands two towns, Mr. Alvarado recounted his thrice-weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao, which began at 4 a.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m.
Last year, on the ferry to the big island, Mr. Alvarado suffered a heart attack. He had open-heart surgery and survived. Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques, he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist. Specialists visit Vieques infrequently.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Less than a month after facing down Florence, the U.S. faces another historic storm. Hurricane Michael is churning its way toward Floridas Panhandle as a Category 4 monster. As of 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the storms winds were roaring at a sustained 145 mph with gusts higher, according to data gathered by Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Michael was 90 miles offshore from Panama Beach and is expected to make landfall late morning or early afternoon. The threats will be manifold, but among the most dangerous will be up to 14 feet of storm surge for large parts of the coast. Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, but there has never been a storm like Michael to hit this part of the state. Atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach tweeted that Michaels 933 millibar central pressurea key meteorological measure of intensity where lower generally means strongeris the seventh lowest of any storm ever to reach Florida. The list of storms with lower pressures is an ignominious one, including last years Irma, Andrew in 1992, and the Lake Okeechobee and Great Miami hurricanes that decimated the state in the 1920s. This is not the type of company you want to keep. The National Weather Service Tallahassee office issued a stark graphic and warning late last night to underscore what the region is facing. The statement in part reads: We searched the historical database for category 4 hurricanes that have made landfall in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.

ADAM LIPTAK,"“I’ve always had a broad sense of humor and a candid way of speaking to both male and female law clerks alike,” he wrote. “In doing so, I may not have been mindful enough of the special challenges and pressures that women face in the workplace.” Chief Justice Roberts said he had assembled a task force to examine whether the court system’s procedures for addressing inappropriate conduct were adequate. The young lawyers who serve as law clerks to judges, typically for a year soon after graduating from law school, may require special attention, he suggested, as they are meant to keep confidential what happens in their judge’s chambers. “I expect the working group to consider whether changes are needed in our codes of conduct, our guidance to employees — including law clerks — on issues of confidentiality and reporting of instances of misconduct, our educational programs, and our rules for investigating and processing misconduct complaints,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “These concerns warrant serious attention from all quarters of the judicial branch,” he added. “I have great confidence in the men and women who comprise our judiciary. I am sure that the overwhelming number have no tolerance for harassment and share the view that victims must have clear and immediate recourse to effective remedies.” The remarks on sexual harassment were a brief coda, probably added late in the drafting process, to a report mostly devoted to the court system’s efforts to prepare for natural disasters. “We cannot forget our fellow citizens in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are continuing to recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and those in California who continue to confront historic wildfires and their smoldering consequences,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “The federal judiciary has an ongoing responsibility to prepare for catastrophes and ensure that the third branch of government remains open and functional during times of national emergency.” Noting that a federal law requires federal courts to be “always open,” the chief justice wrote that “the judiciary must anticipate the broad range of calamities that might strike, ranging from severe weather to earthquakes, from cyberterrorism to on-the-ground terrorist attacks.” The past year’s weather posed special challenges, he wrote. “The hurricanes brought flooding, power outages, infrastructure damage and individual hardship to Texas and Florida,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. “But the judicial districts of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were especially hard hit.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the hurricane names Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate are being taken off the list by the by the World Meteorological Organization. ""Storm names are retired if they were so deadly or destructive that the future use of the name would be insensitive - otherwise names are reused on a six-year cycle,"" the NOAA said. 2018 HURRICANE SEASON WILL BE 'SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE,' RESEARCHERS SAY Hurricane Harvey is pictured off the coast of Texas, U.S. from aboard the International Space Station in this August 25, 2017 NASA handout photo. (NASA) The international committee has decided that the names Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate will be replaced with Harold, Idalia, Margot and Nigel and make their debut during the 2023 hurricane season. Since 1954, there have been 86 names that have been retired from the Atlantic basic list, when storms began to be named. The 2005 hurricane season has the most retired names, with five for one season, including Hurricane Katrina, according to the NOAA. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season featured 17 named storms, of which 10 strengthened to hurricanes and six became major hurricanes at the strength of a Category 3 or higher. Houses are seen in ruins in Codrington on the island of Barbuda just after a month after Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda, October 7, 2017. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) Hurricane Harvey hit Texas Aug. 25 as a Category 4 storm, killing at least 68 people and becoming the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history (after inflation) behind Katrina in 2005. Less than a month later, Hurricane Irma caused 44 deaths and 85 indirect deaths in the Caribbean and Florida, after reaching Category 5 intensity over the Caribbean before making landfall in the Florida Keys on Sept. 10 as a Category 4 storm. Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on Sept. 19, causing 31 deaths in Dominica and 65 in Puerto Rico, according to the NOAA. Maria is the third costliest hurricane in U.S. history, behind Harvey and Katrina. In early October, Nate's rainfall inundated Central America and killed 45 before it made landfall on the northern Gulf Coast as a category 1 hurricane. The hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, and a pre-season forecast released last week from Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project calls for 14 named storms. Seven are predicted to strengthen into hurricanes, with three becoming major storms that are Category 3 or higher. The research team predicts that 2018 hurricane activity will be about 135 percent of the average season.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","In what has become a deeply unwelcome summertime tradition, Floridians are once again finding their waterways befouled with blue-green algae. Since June, an algae bloom of epic proportions has gripped Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater lake in the state. By last week, the bloom had engulfed 90 percent of the lake’s open water (436 square miles), according to satellite data analyzed by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The algae are also invading the St. Lucie River and estuary to the east and the Caloosahatchee River and estuary to the west, which are connected to Lake Okeechobee via canals. On Monday, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in seven coastal counties threatened by the slime. Algae blooms have become a regular summertime occurrence along Florida’s coastlines and in Lake Okeechobee, a vital reservoir that supplies drinking water to locals and irrigates the state’s $1.5 billion agriculture industry. That same industry deserves a good share of the blame: According to the Miami Herald, nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from farms, along with leaky septic tanks, are essentially dumping copious amounts of fertilizer into the lake. Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida last September, is also partly to blame for causing nutrient-laden watersheds north of the lake to overflow and supercharge this year’s blooms, according to Florida Sea Grant director Karl Havens. Combine all those nutrients with hot summer days and loads of sunshine, and you get ideal conditions for algae to thrive. The blooms don’t just look and smell disgusting, they can be dangerous. As Florida’s Department of Health notes on its website, some blue-green algae produce cyanotoxins that can affect the skin, liver, and nervous system at high enough concentrations. A press release issued by the DOH in June reminded beachgoers that swimming in algae-laden water “may cause ear, eye and skin reactions, and hay fever and flu-like symptoms” including diarrhea. While there’s no easy fix—as the Miami Herald notes, even if the agricultural industry were to clean up all its pollution today, mud at the bottom of the lake has become so nutrient-laden it can potentially fuel blooms for years to come—reducing the lake’s discharges to the east and west would certainly provide some relief along Florida’s coastlines. Trouble is, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is currently forced to discharge water whenever the lake level gets too high, in order to prevent a breach of the dike humans built to contain the lake (and keep it from spilling over onto the settled agricultural lands to the south) in the mid 20th century. But there might soon be a better option. For years, environmentalists and many Floridians have been pushing an Everglades restoration plan that seeks to move more water south from Lake Okeechobee into freshwater-starved wetlands. On Tuesday, to the cheers of politically-expedient environmentalist Rick Scott whose policies many Democrats and environmentalists say exacerbated the crisis, the White House approved a crucial piece of that project—a reservoir that’ll send an an extra 370,000 acre-feet of water to the Everglades each year. The reservoir is expected to reduce discharges to the east and west of Lake Okeechobee by 63 percent, according to the South Florida Water Management district. That could make a serious dent in the coastal algae problem. “After 18 years of unnecessary delay, Florida is finally poised to move forward with the solution that scientists and policymakers alike have long known is indispensable to significantly reducing the scourge of algae-causing discharges of Lake Okeechobee water and vital to sending water south,” Everglades Foundation CEO Eric Eikenberg told Earther in an emailed statement. The reservoir isn’t a done deal yet: Per E&amp;E News, the Senate still needs to put the project in a water infrastructure authorization bill it’s expected to take up this summer. For now at least, the slime ain’t going anywhere.","In what has become a deeply unwelcome summertime tradition, Floridians are once again finding their waterways befouled with blue-green algae.

George Dvorsky,"A new simulation produced by NASA’s Data Visualization Studio packs four months of swirling atmospheric activity into a two minute clip that reminds us how unrelenting this past hurricane season really was. This looks like a timelapse pieced together from images taken by satellites, but it’s not. Rather, it’s a computer simulation based on real data. Specifically, the model is showing the progression of aerosols—wafts of sea salt, dust, and smoke—blowing through the atmosphere from July 31 to November 1, 2017. This visualization was churned out by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a system of math models developed by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. What’s particularly neat about this video is that the hurricanes kind of appear by accident. Hurricanes aren’t aerosols, but because the NASA scientists were tracking the stuff carried by wind around the atmosphere, they were able to visualize the various storm systems as they moved across the Atlantic. NASA explains : During the 2017 hurricane season, the storms are visible because of the sea salt that is captured by the storms. Strong winds at the surface lift the sea salt into the atmosphere and the particles are incorporated into the storm. Hurricane Irma is the first big storm that spawns off the coast of Africa. As the storm spins up, the Saharan dust is absorbed in cloud droplets and washed out of the storm as rain. This process happens with most of the storms, except for Hurricane Ophelia. Forming more northward than most storms, Ophelia traveled to the east picking up dust from the Sahara and smoke from large fires in Portugal. Retaining its tropical storm state farther northward than any system in the Atlantic, Ophelia carried the smoke and dust into Ireland and the UK. It’s a gorgeous simulation for sure, but scientists can use models like these to understand all the different things that go on in our atmosphere and how they all fit together to produce weather.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

ALAN BLINDER,"Free tarps are being handed out at the parking lot on 15th Street! The Federal Emergency Management Agency, fearing that unchecked rumors could create new perils, has turned to an increasingly familiar page in its response playbook and set up a web page labeled Hurricane Michael Rumor Control. Responding to speculation about payments at places like Sams Club, the agency wrote, FEMA is not writing checks to survivors in person at any locations. Points of distribution have FEMA- and state-provided supplies, including food and water that survivors can pick up for personal use. The solution for some is to try to avoid information entirely: I dont even listen to the radio right now, said Ryan Fountain, whose home in a nearby town suffered minor damage. While the internet helps emergency officials rebut speculation, researchers note that the same platforms often allow rumors to spread farther and faster than ever before. With cellphone service still at a premium the governors office reported that just 54 percent of service was restored in Bay County by Wednesday, a week after the storm it is harder to strike down speculation. The general public is not very good at differentiating truth from rumor related to disasters, Dr. Jun Zhuang, an associate professor at the University at Buffalo who received federal funding to study speculation after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, wrote in a summary of his findings. The public tends to spread rumors and is unlikely to correct false information, even after it has been debunked. Schools will be closed so long that students are certain to be held back! Ending a rumor is not easy. School administrators across the Panhandle, for example, are still assessing damage to buildings and mapping plans for the rest of the year. Ms. Sales county is flying a plane towing a banner a rare sight on the less-toured east side of the Hathaway Bridge over Panama City with tips about how to obtain updates, and is distributing fliers to residents. But she conceded that even emergency officials are prone to rumors, at least among themselves. Sometime on the day of the storm, she said, there was a call between the emergency operations center and someone about a firefighter. Then the buildings phone service went dead. Word spread through the Panhandle, including its emergency centers, that Bay Countys fortified complex was on fire. It was not.",Bed bugs have infested a shelter. FEMA is distributing free cash.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"US officials are warning Hurricane Florence could kill ""a lot of people"" with risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding as the storm begins to lash the country's East Coast. Florence, although now downgraded to a category one storm, is slow-moving and could linger for days, bringing ""copious amounts of rain"". Image copyright NASA Earth Observatory Florence is expected to make landfall at noon local time on Friday and is moving towards land with wind speeds of 90mph (150 km/h). The National Hurricane Center says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Storm will hit east coast Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland have declared a state of emergency as forecasts showed Florence dumping historic amounts of rain on the area. Tens of thousands of homes are already without power and sea water is washing through coastal streets. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see,"" Fema spokesman Jeff Byard said. Evacuation orders are in place for more than a million people. More than 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, with most of the coastal region's airports closed. Storm surges could be devastating The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. Meteorologists have warned some rivers may see their flows ""reversed"". Storm surges are caused when huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Storm could dump record rainfall Florence is forecast to dump up to one metre (40 ins) of rain in some areas after it makes landfall. The torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said North Carolina is likely to see eight months' worth of rain in two to three days. Florence's winds are still strong The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category two level of 96-110mph to a category one level of 119-153mph. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Florence was being followed in the Atlantic by two other storms - Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Isaac. But Helene is now moving north east towards the UK and Isaac is moving west across the Caribbean. How hurricanes happen Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Sasha Lekach,"Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate. Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday before being downgraded to a tropical storm. SEE ALSO: There's a glaring weakness in electric vehicles. (It's range anxiety.) As NPR reported, Tesla can remotely tap into the max capacity of its 75 kWh batteries in Model S and X vehicles, adding about 30 more miles of range. In any natural disaster situation like this, our policy is to make Superchargers free of use in order to optimize evacuation routes for affected customers https://t.co/SOUlKv3UUZ — Tesla (@Tesla) September 13, 2018 Tesla owners were notified that Tesla had enabled the additional battery capacity. They were also offered free Supercharging, which gets batteries to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. ""We hope that this gives you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,"" the notification read. Normal battery configurations will return mid-October. Tesla also extended battery range last year during Hurricane Irma. On GM vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac, all OnStar members have access to Crisis Assist services during disasters like Florence even if they don't usually subscribe. That means people can use their cars to navigate out of disaster zones, find hotels, gas, or use their vehicles as a WiFi hotspot. Mary Ann Adams, disaster response and crisis incident manager for OnStar, said in a phone call Friday that 25,000 calls had come in since Tuesday through the Crisis Assist service to always-available response teams. ""Since cars are connected they provide connections they may not have,"" she said about people in the storm zone. For many the OnStar tools mean access to a working phone and a charging source. For others it's a way to find a hotel or the latest storm updates. ""I think of it as another tool to survive the storm and navigate the storm,"" she said. After a storm, calls tick up again as damage is assessed and further evacuations may be required. For some it's a matter of checking to see if they can return home. If they can, signage and roads may be destroyed, prompting more calls to the command center. As of Friday afternoon, according to the New York Times, four deaths have been linked to the storm. It's supposed to move southwest into South Carolina before heading north.","Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings to prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is gathering power as it approaches the Carolinas. Mr Trump tweeted that this was ""one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years"". Florence is at present a Category Four storm, with sustained winds of about 140mph (220km/h). On its current track it is predicted to make landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, late on Thursday. A number of mandatory evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster has given the entire coastline until noon on Tuesday to leave. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington has also ordered a mandatory evacuation of students. In its latest advisory at 23:00 eastern time (0300 GMT). the National Hurricane Center said of Florence: ""Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday."" It said hurricane-force winds would ""extend outward up to 40 miles (65km) from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds [would] extend outward up to 150 miles (240km)"". The 23:00 report placed Florence about 465 miles south-east of Bermuda, moving west-north-west at about 13mph. This would see it pass between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and make landfall on the North Carolina coast at about 22:00 local time on Thursday. The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was a large storm and getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boarding up under way in Holden Beach, North Carolina He said the predicted heavy rain and storm surges could threaten areas such as Charleston, which is only a few metres above sea level, and that Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. Schools in affected areas will begin to close on Tuesday and lanes on some highways will be reversed to aid evacuations. Media caption Will hurricanes like those in 2017 wreak havoc yet again? ""We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,"" Mr McMaster said. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". Rainfall could be up to 20in (50cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Carolina airmen are deployed for the expected rescue efforts National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham told the Associated Press news agency: ""It's not just the coast. When you stall a system like this and it moves real slow, some of that rainfall can extend well away from the centre."" A similar event caused devastation in Texas last year when Hurricane Harvey hit. 'We were nonstop' President Trump has signed approvals for the declarations of emergency in the Carolinas and said he had spoken to the governors of the affected states. He sent out five tweets over four hours warning people to heed advice and stay safe: The US Navy is sending 30 ships stationed in Virginia out to sea. Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. Hardware store manager John Johnson told Agence France-Presse news agency there had been a rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags at his Charleston shop. ""From eight o'clock 'til two we were slammed. We were nonstop,"" he said.

Michael Johansson,"Eight months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the day-to-day crises are far fewer for most of us, but the island remains a profoundly changed place. One of the most pernicious challenges is electricity. Few people had power after Irma and no one had power after Maria, which hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Local outages are a daily reality; large-scale blackouts occur occasionally; and tens of thousands of households have yet to be reconnected to the grid. In this vacuum, generators have become commonplace among those who can afford them. The rumble of generators now often drowns out the calls of the coquí frogs, but they keep us going, like the one powering the computer I am writing on right now. I work for the Dengue Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located in San Juan, which is charged with reducing the impact of dengue globally. Our branch maintains a collection of hundreds of thousands of frozen biological samples, and maintaining those freezers in the event of electrical outages is a longstanding concern. But until Irma and Maria struck, I had not appreciated the full extent of our dependence on electricity. Expensive laboratory equipment can easily be damaged by surges or sudden lapses in power. Computers, servers and the network we rely on are equally susceptible to these fluctuations. And all of the equipment is highly sensitive to heat and humidity, the norm for this tropical island. Without electricity, there is no climate control, and mold and rust are quick to attack. Thankfully, our main generator never failed, and our backup generator kept the freezers cold through periodic maintenance until power was restored to our facility on January 16, 2018, almost four months after Maria. Still, as a precaution, we shipped thousands of samples to Atlanta as a backup in November. But we weren’t the only public-health organization that faced a potential crisis. The Puerto Rico Department of Health laboratories sustained substantial damage, requiring a collaborative effort to temporarily provide off-island testing for priority infectious diseases. That testing is still being transitioned back. Even with electricity, laboratory equipment requires recertification prior to being used for diagnostic testing, and for months, certified technicians and parts for specialized equipment were thousands of miles away with limited options to fly to Puerto Rico, find a hotel room in San Juan or even send parts. Compounding these challenges, those of us working in public health are not just working to get public health back up and running but also to put our own lives back together. Simply plugging the computer in again does not change our altered reality. Our minds are still elsewhere much of the time, we still need to repair our homes, keep the gas tank full and maintain a supply of non-perishable food, water and batteries for the next blackout. Maria was traumatic, and the months of struggle afterwards even more so. In addition to the tens of thousands of people still without electricity, many more are living under tarps, and the number who have emigrated or died is unclear. Isolation, an unprecedented fiscal crisis, and high levels of poverty added to the challenges. Constant uncertainty and unstable electricity, water, food and fuel try everyone’s patience but have also brought out the best in us. People are the greatest asset to public health, the CDC Dengue Branch and Puerto Rico. Everywhere, people are being creative and helping family, friends and communities. And here we are, working to rebuild but unsure when local laboratories will be functioning at full capacity, when the power will come back at home, when the grid will be reliable, what will happen if we have a medical emergency, and whether another hurricane will head our way this year. Maria and her aftermath have taught us a lot, about preparedness, community, resilience and fragility.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Trump: Puerto Rico hurricane response an ""unsung success"" President Donald Trump has been criticised for hailing the US response to the deadly Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year as ""tremendous"". The mayor of its capital tweeted: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all."" Puerto Rico only finished restoring full power last month, 11 months after the hurricane hit. A recent report says 8% left the island after the hurricane and many died due to poor health care and other services. Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US. is home to some 3.3 million people. What did the president say? He was asked at the White House what lessons could be learned from Hurricane Maria as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas. Maria, he said, was the ""hardest one we had by far because of the island nature"", adding: ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about. Media caption Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard ""The job that Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and law enforcement and everybody did working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success."" Mr Trump had said recently: ""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done."" What has the response been to his latest comments? The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of Mr Trump who earlier described his response to Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"", said his latest comment ""added ""insult to injury"". Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: ""Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a 'success'. That is a tragedy and a disgrace."" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""This is an offensive, hurtful and blatantly false comment from the president."" New York Democratic primary winner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said: ""Some of my [Puerto Rico] family just got power a few weeks ago. People are developing respiratory issues partly due to airborne fungal spores from lack of proper cleanup. The admin's response to Puerto Rico has been a disaster."" Some Trump supporters on social media accepted there had been failures but said the president had done all he could and that it was Puerto Rican officials who were to blame. What happened in Hurricane Maria? Maria made landfall in mid-September last year having just been downgraded to a category four hurricane, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and driving rain. It caused catastrophic damage to the north-eastern Caribbean and was the most intense cyclone worldwide in 2017. Infrastructure was severely damaged in Puerto Rico and the territory struggled to make repairs to the power grid, only completing the work 11 months later. Maria was estimated to have caused $100bn (£77bn) in damage.

ERIKA P. RODRIGUEZ,"Credit Photographs by Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times A group of friends in Guaynabo, P.R., were singing by the light of their cellphones. Days before Christmas, and three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall, parts of the Puerto Rico are still without water, and over a million people are in the dark. Hundreds of residents remain in shelters, unable to return home. Schools that have been able to resume classes are still without power. But in towns around the island, residents are trying to keep holiday traditions alive, despite the circumstances. The group in Guaynabo had arrived at the home of Juan Pablo González for a parranda, a Puerto Rican Christmas tradition that brings friends together to sing carols, usually in the middle of the night. Mr. González’s home was still without power, so people used cellphones and flashlights to see one another and read song lyrics. In Old San Juan, Marta Cirino performed Christmas songs with Caiko y Los del Soberao, an Afro-Puerto Rican music group. The neighborhood is usually crowded with tourists, but on a recent night, it was full of locals who sang and danced to the music. The Eugenio María de Hostos School in Canóvanas has been used as a shelter for weeks, and is currently home to 94 people. Mildred Rodriguez, a resident at the shelter, brought an artificial Christmas tree salvaged from the debris at her home, and decorated it with what she could find. Workers cleaned and decorated the Escuela del Pueblo Trabajador, a Montessori institution near Trujillo Alto. The school decided to continue a decades-long tradition and hold a holiday celebration for the children after parents asked for it. The area has been without power since Hurricane Irma made landfall a few weeks before Maria swept over the island, but the school reopened in early October. In previous years, only one Puerto Rican flag would hang near the Three Kings altar at the school, but this year dozens of flags were integrated in the decoration. The academic director of the school, Marlyn Souffront, wanted to focus on reaffirming the island’s cultural identity.","Large parts of Puerto Rico still don’t have power after Hurricane Maria, but some residents are determined to celebrate Christmas one way or another.",2017-12-22T10:00:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After Surviving Maria, Trying to Keep Holiday Traditions Alive",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/us/hurricane-maria-christmas-puerto-rico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/21/us/00navidad-01/00navidad-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1

Lane Pittman, who has built a brand off doing dumb shit like walk into dangerous hurricanes instead of seeking shelter, drove to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to fight Hurricane Florence. SEE ALSO: NASA video shows massive scale of Hurricane Florence from space As everyone else in the storm's path evacuated, Pittman — who started referring to himself as Florida Man — marched into the street barefoot. With up to 50 mile per hour winds whipping his hair and American flag, Pittman wore nothing but a pair of bright blue shorts. Embracing the spirit of the United States itself, Pittman was extraordinarily stupid for the sake of looking good with a flag. He topped off the video with Slayer's ""Raining Blood."" It's kind of glorious, but mostly idiotic. Pittman pulled the same stunt during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Irma last year. Although he could have been perfectly safe and sound in his hometown of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, Pittman decided to drive up to South Carolina to face off with the hurricane. He started a GoFundMe that raised $380 in a day to cover the cost of gas and coffee. Florida Man fought Hurricane Florence with the help of some good old fashioned crowd funding.

""The audience wants to know... what is in your head to be outside in this weather right now, not wearing any clothes?"" ""Just being free and American, man,"" Pittman shrugged.

Emily Rosko,"Emily Rosko's most recent poetry collection is ""Weather Inventions"" (University of Akron Press, 2018). She is associate professor at the College of Charleston and director of the master of fine arts program in creative writing. The views expressed here are solely the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies. As the storm nears and intensifies, so too does the stress of preparing and planning. Tuesday morning, my blood began prickling underneath my skin; I felt a nervous-energy in my gut, as though I were perched on the starting blocks before a race. We are not in the clear, and the current information cannot tell us how Florence will behave once it approaches the coast. Projected track lines across the Carolinas look as though a toddler has scribbled all over the map. Charleston sits on the edge of the cone of uncertainty. The schools, the college campus where I work, all the city offices are all closed. My family is leaving our house on the Charleston peninsula to go inland -- the third time in three consecutive falls. Florence threatens, and yet it's beautiful here right now. After the 5 inches of unprecedented snow and ice that glazed the camellias and gave us an actual winter, after a long summer of rains, after an eye-blink of a spring, our front yard garden is ripening. The sages and salvias, the bee balm and zinnias are drawing in a cast of bees and butterflies. The promise of less humid days is visible in the resurrection ferns browning on the live oaks, in the sky's dynamic mixture of high and low altitude clouds. With the school year in full swing, we were just feeling settled into our weekly routines. Last year, Irma interrupted this exact same week of the school year, and the year before Matthew arrived not far after. I ask myself -- did I plant our winter vegetable garden before or after Irma, before or after Matthew? September and October have new meanings for me now. Time moves strangely when a hurricane eyes you from the ocean. You reside in a surreal pre-storm space. The closest comparison I have to this altered time-space is caring for a newborn in the first weeks. You try to concentrate on other things. There's a constant pressure behind your eyes; you do not sleep well. You go hour-by-hour reassessing with every forecast update. You never feel you are making the best choices. You exist in a mixed state of hyper-vigilance and fret; you go back-and-forth discussing the storm's probabilities and what gambles you're willing to take. You might put up plywood; you might not. You might evacuate, if you can. You might not. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait -- that's the pre-storm mantra. Then the storm arrives, and you wait. As I wait, I talk to my neighbors, colleagues and students about their thoughts: Will you stay? What's your plan? In Charleston, you can often tell a South Carolina native from a transplant, like me, based on how they react to these storm threats. Charleston natives, long seasoned by storms and near misses, will joke about how they plan to go to the bars downtown, now that there's plenty of parking with all the tourists gone. They will remind you about Hurricane Hugo -- the measuring stick of what disaster means here. Many will say that if it's a Category 4 or higher, then they will go, but only then. I do not feel seasoned by these storms yet. But I know what will likely happen here: The peninsula's outermost roads will be inundated with saltwater; the downtown Market will flood. Some of the majestic old trees, heavy with rot, will crack and fall. Every intersection notorious even for sunny-day flooding will fill up all the faster; the crosstown will become a stream. The bridges that link the peninsula and the sea islands will close. Trucks delivering food will be delayed. Once in the clear, people will venture outside; others will arrive back to their houses to clean up what puddles or debris they find. Threads on our neighborhood Facebook feed will ask what restaurants are open and serving -- gosh darn it, they say, they need to get out of the house, they're stir crazy. At the College of Charleston, we'll have to re-create our syllabi and fit in make-up classes. My summer garden will be toppled, flattened in spirals. It'll be a nuisance -- at least that's what I'm most hopeful for -- a repeat of what has happened twice before. I'm lucky that I can entertain the thought of Hurricane Florence as a nuisance, but even this is overshadowed by certain catastrophe to the north where the impacts won't be merely bothersome but biblical. Rain there is measured in feet and not inches; the color scale indicating rain accumulations grows a deeper gray as all the more alarming colors were spent further down the scale. As I sit here pitched on the edges of the cone of uncertainty, I'm reminded how much of our lives -- if we are fortunate -- unfold at the edge of a catastrophe that is always striking somewhere and striking hard, sometimes on a scale distant and unimaginable.","Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies.

Mark Kaufman,"While three hurricanes swirled in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans on September 6, 2017, the sun blasted off a powerful flare of energy, which soon smacked into Earth and severed radio communications across half the planet for hours. Just four days later, another solar flare — an intense burst of radiation from the sun — hit Earth and again disrupted communications, as major storms continued to churn toward land. This confluence of tempestuous weather both on Earth and in space was recently described by scientists in the journal Space Weather, the research led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) researchers. SEE ALSO: A 12-mile, underground lake may have been found on Mars. What could live there? ""Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,” said NOAA's Rob Redmon in a statement. Fortunately, many governments no longer rely strictly on radio to communicate over long distances, though aviation and marine emergency services still employ high-frequency radio, which bounces radio waves across Earth's high atmosphere, allowing contact over long distances. “You can hear a solar flare on the air as it's taking place. It’s like hearing bacon fry in a pan, it just all of a sudden gets real staticky and then it’s like someone just turns the light completely off, you don't hear anything,"" Bobby Graves, a radio operator for Hurricane Watch Net which uses radio during hurricanes,"" said in a statement. When the radiation from strong solar flares smacks the Earth, it hits an energetic layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere, causing it to absorb — and thus impair — long distance radio waves. ""And that's what happened this last year on two occasions,” noted Graves. “We had to wait ‘til the power of those solar flares weakened so that our signals could actually bounce back off the atmosphere. It was a helpless situation."" The sun released a powerful solar flare on November 4, 2003. Image: nasa The first of the two flares, on September 6, arrived during a remarkably bad time, as Hurricane Irma — a highest rated Category 5 storm — was in the process of leveling the island of Barbuda. The massive storm would later make landfall in Florida. NASA is still intensively studying the sun, to improve the space agency's understanding of when unpredictable events, like solar flares, might pose a harm to Earth. Worse yet are Corneal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, which are explosions of billions of tons of solar matter hurled into space. Events like these pose serious threats to our modern telecommunication and electrical grids — consequences far worse than temporary radio blackouts. In 1859, a CME collided with Earth, and set telegraph equipment on fire. To improve humanity's understanding of our fickle star, in early August NASA will send the heavily-fortified Parker Solar Probe into the sun's scorching outer atmosphere, to better learn how the sun works — and when it might blast powerful surges of energy into space.","While three hurricanes swirled in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans on September 6, 2017, the sun blasted off a powerful flare of energy, which soon smacked into Earth and severed radio communications across half the planet for hours.

Joe Reedy / AP,"(TALLAHASSEE, Fla.) — Florida’s Legislature has approved a rule requiring backup power sources in the state’s nursing homes, prompted by the deaths of several residents at a sweltering nursing home in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. The state House and Senate both unanimously okayed the measure Monday and it now heads to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott, who is expected to sign it. The measure would require facilities to have a generator capable of keeping facilities at 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) or lower for at least four days. It also requires them to keep 72 hours of fuel on site. The rule was originally issued by Scott and Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration, or AHCA, following the deaths at a South Florida nursing home after Irma last year. The original rule stated that nursing homes and assisted living facilities had to be in compliance by Nov. 15 or face a fine of $1,000 per day. But a state administrative judge sided last October with nursing homes that had challenged the tight deadlines. Justin Senior, secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration, said last week that the rule would give seniors adequate protection in the event of a disaster. All 577 nursing homes in Florida must be in compliance by July 1. As of Jan. 8, more than 100 were already in compliance. Authorities can grant an extension until Jan. 1, 2019, for nursing homes that would face delays in installing equipment. The bill did not include mandating generators at assisted living facilities. Scott wants that included, and the Senate is working on a separate bill to get those facilities included. “Our position has not changed — assisted living facilities need to be included,” the governor’s press secretary Lauren Schenone said in an email. “We are continuing to work with the Florida Legislature to make sure this gets done.” State laws also mandate that any rule that increases the costs for a business over $1 million over a five-year period must be ratified by the Legislature. According to a Legislative staff analysis, the total costs for nursing homes to be in compliance statewide would be $108,224,945. The estimated cost for a generator for a 120-bed facility is $315,000 according to an AHCA study. State Rep. Travis Cummings, who chairs the Health &amp; Human Services Committee, said the costs for the state’s 2,951 assisted living facilities would have put financial constraints on those facilities and the state.",The rule requires backup power sources in the state's nursing homes,2018-03-06T15:38:52Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Nursing Home Deaths in Wake of Hurricane Irma Prompt New Rule,http://time.com/5187738/nursing-home-deaths-hurricane-irma/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/florida-nursing-homes.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Irma,1
JORGE G. CASTAÑEDA,"The second pillar — $25 billion for a border wall — is obviously offensive to Mexico, but the country’s lame-duck president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has been much more adamant in his opposition to paying for the wall than to its actual construction. Mr. Peña Nieto either doesn’t believe it will ever see the light of day or lacks the backbone to oppose it. But Mr. Trump’s wall is something Mexico can simultaneously reject and live with, particularly if it will take years to build and if it merely complements segments of fences erected by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. Mr. Trump’s third pillar is the most insulting for many Americans, since it eliminates the family reunification principle for accepting legal immigrants from abroad. Intended to deter “chain migration,” it would replace the family criterion with a merit-based system. In the future, only spouses and underage offspring (as opposed to parents and siblings today) of American citizens would be allowed permanent residence, and eventually citizenship. The net effect would be to “whiten” immigration and limit the share of Mexicans. Since the largest group of foreigners applying for family reunification is by far Mexican (three times as many as Chinese citizens, for example), this would reduce the number of applicants from Mexico who get green cards. Nearly 200,000 Mexicans got green cards in fiscal year 2016; halving that number through a lengthy and tedious procedure that frustrates many Mexicans would not be as bad as shutting down the whole program. The last pillar would suppress the lottery system that grants a small number of immigrant visas to applicants from underrepresented nations, mainly African. Again, this would surely “whiten” immigration and is thus a despicable proposal, but it does not affect Mexico. There is no lottery system for Mexicans. So, viewed somewhat cynically from the perspective of strict Mexican national interests, the four-pillar plan has inconveniences for Mexico but also many advantages. That it is racist as well as unworthy of the American immigration ideal and inflames the worst demons in American society is another matter. As Mr. Trump says, countries have to look out for their own interests. To make this plan attractive to Mexico, its leaders need to persuade the American president to increase the number of temporary-worker visas. Again, by far the largest number of these permits are extended to Mexicans. H-2A visas, for seasonal agricultural workers, have no congressional cap; H-2B visas, for seasonal nonagricultural activities, do, but it can be lifted and has been for several years. The Trump administration can increase these numbers significantly without congressional approval. An immense reconstruction effort is underway in Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and, with virtual full employment, there is a huge demand for low-skilled, low-wage labor in those regions. It can come only from Mexico. Were Mr. Peña Nieto to make such a suggestion and were Mr. Trump to accept it, both countries’ interests would be well served. In the early years of this century, a comprehensive package like this was called “the whole enchilada.” Half a loaf, or whatever nutritional metaphor one prefers, is not bad. Jorge G.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

"AP, AP","JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas State has sued Miami and is seeking $650,000 in damages for failing to reschedule the football game in Jonesboro that was canceled in September because of concerns about Hurricane Irma. The lawsuit was filed in Craighead County District Court late Friday afternoon, and Arkansas State says Miami has ""refused to timely and reasonably reschedule the game in years in which it has openings."" Miami was scheduled to play at Arkansas State on Sept. 9 as part of a two-game contract that saw the Red Wolves travel to face the Hurricanes in 2014. However, because of travel issues ahead of Hurricane Irma, the game was canceled — despite Arkansas State athletic director Terry Mohajir offering to play the game a day earlier and aid with travel and accommodations. Miami was off the week following the canceled game with the Red Wolves before returning to the field a week later against Toledo. The Hurricanes began the season 10-0 before losing their final three games of the season, including an Orange Bowl loss to Wisconsin that left them at No. 13 in the final Associated Press poll. Arkansas State finished 7-5, including a loss to Middle Tennessee State to end its season in the Camellia Bowl. In the lawsuit, Arkansas State says Mohajir reached out to Miami athletic director Blake James last month about rescheduling the game. It also says James told Mohajir the earliest Miami could play the game in Jonesboro would be sometime during the 2024-28 seasons — despite Arkansas State contacting a scheduling service that said Miami had openings in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Mohajir said he offered to play another game at Miami if the Hurricanes would play at Arkansas State in either of those seasons, but that James said those weren't available because of prior scheduling agreements. Several sporting events were impacted by Hurricane Irma, including the NFL opener between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Miami Dolphins that was delayed until November. Also, UCF's home game against Memphis was moved up a day to Friday night, Florida International moved its home against Alcorn State to a neutral field in Birmingham a day earlier and Florida State moved its home game against Louisiana-Monroe to December. ___ More college football coverage: http://collegefootball.ap.org/ and www.Twitter.com/AP_Top25 Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Gibraltar has always had the potential to cause a Brexit bust-up, even though Article 50 is perhaps less important here than Article 10... of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.

""Somehow we had not realised or considered it before,"" says Joe Garcia, a veteran local journalist who has been covering all things Gibraltar since the 1960s. ""People who bet online in Britain, 60% of those bets actually come through Gibraltar, and it's the same with requests for car insurance. When you are out in Britain, look around.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many residents fear long delays at the Gibraltar-Spanish border after Brexit But many of the people who work in the sector live across the border in Spain. And there are persistent fears about the potential for long delays at the border after Brexit, and about the future of the Rock's low tax regime, which Spain sees as unfair competition. ""They will probably try to use [Brexit] to get Gibraltar to stop being what they call a tax haven,"" says Spanish historian Mercedes Penalba-Sotorrio. ""I think one of the main priorities is to stop that."" But the most sensitive issue is Spain's long-standing claim for sovereignty - shared or otherwise - which is rejected outright by both the UK and Gibraltar itself. Image copyright Getty Images Suspicion was heightened after the remaining EU27 decided formally that no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without a bilateral agreement between Spain and the UK. Now that language is threatening to complicate negotiations on a transition period for the UK after Brexit. ""To the frustration of Brussels and the rest of the EU,"" says Mujtaba Rahman of the political consultancy Eurasia Group, ""Madrid is now arguing that the transition represents one such agreement - and that the transition should not apply to Gibraltar unless Spain explicitly agrees, which it currently does not."" If Gibraltar feels under threat, at least it has some influential supporters in London. Last year The Sun updated its classic early 90s headline ""Up Yours Delors"" for the front-page benefit of Spain: ""Up Yours Senors"". But spare a thought for Britain's overseas territories with rather less clout. The Caribbean island of Anguilla has a sea border with the EU, and is fearful of the future. Devastated by Hurricane Irma last year, and dependent on neighbouring islands, it is now bracing for Brexit. Image copyright MOD Image caption The Royal Navy landing ship RFA Mounts Bay delivered six tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla, after Hurricane Irma devastated the island in September 2017 Anguilla's closest gateway to the world lies four miles across the sea in the French half of the island of St Martin, which is officially part of France, and therefore an ""outermost region"" of the EU. Anguilla relies on access to St Martin for many of its daily necessities - from food supplies to MRI scans to the postal service. The nearest international airport lies on the Dutch side of St Martin. ""We have a symbiotic relationship, and we really don't want Brexit to change it,"" says Blondel Cluff, the Anguillan government representative in London. ""But I don't think we've come up in the negotiations yet."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anguilla residents fear losing access to the nearest airport, on the Dutch side of neighbouring St Martin In a report published last year entitled ""Anguilla &amp; Brexit: Britain's forgotten EU border"", the Anguillan government called for a regional customs union with St Martin and a common travel area. Anguilla is also mostly ineligible for British development aid, and is therefore highly dependent on money coming from the EU for more than a third of its budget. ""I know it's difficult when we have a population the size of a British village,"" says Blondel Cluff, ""but we need to make sure we don't get forgotten in the mix."" It all means that even half way round the world Brexit is raising concerns about the freedom of movement of goods, of services, and of course of people. ""The fact that people in overseas territories are going to lose an important element of their citizenship, without having been asked about it, may well give rise to legal challenges in the future,"" says Susie Alegre, a lawyer specialising in the rights of citizens in the British Overseas Territories. Given the bewildering range of Brexit issues that need to be resolved, it is hardly surprising that the overseas territories have not received the attention they feel they deserve. But Susie Alegre believes that could change. ""It may well be - and particularly with the case of Gibraltar - that in the next year you'll suddenly see quite serious issues popping up out of these dots on the map.""","Brexit will have profound consequences for the 250,000 people in the UK's overseas territories.",2018-02-22T01:36:21Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43126719,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6A22/production/_100107172_hi039078419.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Irma,1
Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Puerto Rico submitted a recovery plan to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday that carries an estimated price tag of $139 billion, which is 47 percent more than the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth requested in November. The economic and disaster recovery plan allocates the money to housing, water and energy systems, education, transportation, public buildings, communications, planning, municipalities, as well as to the economy and environment, according to Governor Ricardo Rossello’s office. Puerto Rico’s severe financial problems, which led to bankruptcy court in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations, were compounded by destructive hurricanes that hit the island in September. “Puerto Rico has a unique opportunity to innovate and rebuild in order to become that Puerto Rico we all want,” Rossello said in a statement. He added that the initiatives were aimed at “making us stronger and resilient, while guaranteeing a long-term economic recovery.” Last November, Rossello requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island’s infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. That so-called Build Back Better plan contained a preliminary assessment of damages and an initial estimate of money the island needs to rebuild, according to the statement. The final plan, which was submitted on the deadline day set in the 2018 U.S. budget act, expanded the scope of the November request and was developed with input from federal agencies, the governor’s office said. It was also posted on the internet and subjected to public hearings prior to its submission. Near-term priorities for the money include restoring Puerto Rico’s ailing electrical system, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria, improving emergency preparedness, and repairing public facilities. Long-term objectives include stopping emigration and boosting economic growth.

Tom Simonite,"On a trip to Silicon Valley last year, Defense Secretary James Mattis openly envied tech companies’ superior use of artificial intelligence technology. To help close the gap, one Pentagon unit is now offering $100,000 in prizes to develop algorithms that can interpret high-resolution satellite images. The contest is called the xView Detection Challenge, and starts next month. Entrants will use a trove of hand-annotated satellite images released by the Pentagon to train algorithms to identify details relevant to disaster relief or humanitarian missions. Objects of interest include damaged buildings, utility trucks, and fishing boats. The project is being run by DIUx, an organization started by former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to make it easier for his department to work with technology companies, particularly startups. The need to close the Pentagon’s AI gap with industry was a major motivation for the creation of DIUx, says Brendan McCord, head of machine learning at the organization. DIUx’s challenge is a partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which serves the US military and intelligence apparatus. The competition is modeled on the NGA’s work after events such as hurricane Irma, which swept a trial of destruction and flooding from the Bahamas to Florida last year. Each day, a team of 10 analysts scrutinized hundreds of high-resolution satellite images of the disaster zone, grading damaged or destroyed buildings, and annotating details like impassable roads or bridges. The data was passed onto other agencies helping with the clean up, including FEMA. One goal of the challenge is to automate such work. McCord says algorithms developed for the xView challenge could help NGA after future disasters. If software could make a first pass at annotating new images for damaged buildings and the like, for example, analysts could be more productive. Algorithms good at tagging items of humanitarian interest might also be re-trained to aid other work, such as NGA’s core mission of supporting U.S. warfighters and intelligence analysts. The contest rules grant NGA license to both use and build on winning software. DIUx says winners may be offered the chance to do follow-on work on other defense missions. It is also offering a special prize of $5,000 for the best open source entry, to encourage sharing of ideas created for the contest. The satellite images for the contest are released under a public, noncommercial license for anyone to use. Anyone hoping to win money in the challenge should start by checking their nationality. Contest rules disqualify entrants from several countries, including Cuba and Iran. For those whose papers are in order, the next step is to download a cache of satellite images covering 1,400 km 2 from locations around the world at a resolution of 30 centimeters (1 foot). The images cover both visible and infrared light, and have been hand-annotated with a million examples of 60 different objects. Entrants will use the labeled images to train their algorithms; their software will be tested against a collection of images not made public. The contest will be judged on accuracy, but DIUx also wants the software to be practical, says McCord. LEARN MORE A new Pentagon competition challenges developers to create software that can analyze images like this one. Software competing in the challenge must identify and distinguish objects such as trucks with tanker trailers and cement mixers. The objects were chosen to be relevant to humanitarian projects, and push the limits of existing image-processing algorithms. Stefano Ermon, a professor at Stanford, says that the challenge and dataset could become an important contribution to both machine-learning research, and humanitarian projects worldwide. His research group has developed machine-learning software that maps areas of poverty in African countries using clues such as roads and waterways. The most mature image-recognition technology is focused on online consumer and product photos, thanks to the piles of readily available data, and strong commercial interest from internet companies such as Google. Much less work has been done on interpreting satellite imagery, and the data needed to do so is scant, says Ermon. “We don’t have a lot of labeled data, which is crucial,” he says.

Peter Kotecki,"David J. Phillip/AP From rainfall to wildfires, 2017 was a record-breaking year for natural disasters. In August and September, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria left behind a high death toll, drowned homes, and destroyed power lines. Hundreds of people died in earthquakes around the world, from Mexico to the Iran-Iraq border, and nearly 1,400 people were killed during monsoon rains in South Asia. Fires devastated locations around the world, perhaps most notably in California, where the government spends over 10 times as much money on fighting wildfires as it did 20 years ago. Many of these disasters were caused by elevated temperatures on land and at sea, and climate experts expect these events to keep getting worse. While people may be able to heed their city's evacuation notices or take advantage of evacuation help, some situations are unexpected and make this impossible.

John Walsh,"While scores of people in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia are being told to leave their homes ahead of what's expected to be a devastating Hurricane Florence, animal shelters in the region are also scrambling to get pets out of the storm's path. The National Hurricane Center upgraded Florence to a Category 4 storm and said it expects ""life-threatening"" rainfall and flooding to hit the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states when the storm makes landfall at the end of the week. Evacuating animals from shelters is costly. During last year's Hurricane Irma in Florida, it cost nearly $60,000 to shuttle 265 animals out of harm's way, according to one report. Roughly $11,000 of that total was spent on the animals' veterinary needs, the report said. ""Our expenses for responding to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were around $120,000 last year,"" Jon Elmore, CEO the Charleston Animal Society in South Carolina, told Money magazine. The Charleston Animal Society is currently responsible for about 700 animals across the region. Elmore said the best way for those concerned about the well-being of these animals is to donate money to the shelters. People can send money directly to the Charleston Animal Society online by clicking the ""Donate Today"" button on the top right corner of the page. Those looking to donate to other groups providing aid to animals in danger of Hurricane Florence can use websites like Guidestar and Charity Navigator to make sure their money is going to reputable nonprofit organizations. ""If you think about $120,000 and the 750 animals we were able to save last year, that's just $160 per animal,"" Elmore said. ""For $160 you can save an animal's life."" Unfortunately, many pets end up as strays amid storms like Hurricane Florence as they are left behind by owners evacuating their homes, Matt Williams a spokesperson for the Humane Rescue Alliance told the Associated Press Tuesday. ""Usually, if people do not have a place to take them or if the animals get lost in the shuffle of the storm, they may end up as strays,"" Williams said.

Reuters Editorial,"10 May - New applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly held near more than a 48-year low last week, pointing to a further tightening of labor market conditions. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended May 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dropped to 209,000 during the week ended April 21, which was the lowest level since December 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, leading to a slowdown in job growth as employers struggle to find skilled workers. A government report on Tuesday showed job openings rising to a record 6.6 million in March. Hiring moderated in March and April after surging in February. The unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent in April from 4.1 percent in March. The jobless rate is within striking distance of the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. The Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,500 to 216,000 last week, the lowest level since December 1969. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 30,000 to 1.79 million in the week ended April 28. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 22,000 to 1.81 million, the lowest level since December 1973.

"AP, AP","JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) — A judge has ordered Arkansas State University and the University of Miami to use a third-party mediator to resolve a dispute over a football game that was canceled last year because of concerns about Hurricane Irma. Miami was scheduled to play at ASU in September 2017 as part of a two-game contract that saw the Red Wolves travel to face the Hurricanes in 2014. The game in Jonesboro was canceled because of weather-related travel issues. Arkansas State sued Miami in February, seeking $650,000 in damages because the game wasn't rescheduled. The Jonesboro Sun reports that a judge in Miami on Wednesday gave both sides until Dec. 20 to settle the issue through mediation.

ABC News,"Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) today released their forecast for this year's hurricane season, predicting five to nine hurricanes including at least one that could be a Category 3 or higher. Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. They also predict a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year. Overall, this hurricane season will be near normal or above normal levels. This satellite image obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows Hurricane Maria, Sept. 19, 2017. When is hurricane season? Hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30. Peak hurricane season is from mid-August through mid-October and the peak date for hurricane season on average is Sept. 10. Hurricanes, however, can occur year-round. A car gets towed while men walk in the flooded waters of Telephone Rd. in Houston, Texas on Aug. 30, 2017. What are the hurricane categories? Category 1: Winds from 74 to 95 mph, which can damage homes, trees and power lines. SLIDESHOW: Slideshow: Worst hurricanes in US history Category 2: Winds reaching 96 to 110 mph. These extremely dangerous winds can uproot big trees, cause serious damage to homes and lead to power outages that last several days to weeks. Category 3: With winds from 111 to 129 mph, Category 3 is considered a major hurricane. Devastating damage can occur, and electricity and water might unavailable for several weeks. Category 4: With winds from 130 to 156, Category 4 hurricanes bring catastrophic damage to homes, trees and power lines and can make areas unlivable. This photo shows damaged homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Sunshine Key, Fla., Sept. 13, 2017. Category 5: Five is the highest category for hurricanes with winds reaching 157 mph or higher. These hurricanes cause catastrophic damage by completely destroying buildings and houses and can make areas completely unlivable. What happened last year? The outlook for this year follows a brutal year of hurricanes for the United States -- 2017 was the worst hurricane season for the nation in at least xxxx years. Hurricanes Harvey pummeled Houston in August, followed by Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean and Florida in September, both of which left behind severe flooding that destroyed and damaged homes and businesses.

Jason G. Goldman,"At about 7:30pm on September 7, 2017, Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands. By the next morning, the neighborhood called Blue Hill was gone. And on South Caicos Island, 75% of rooftops were obliterated. Two weeks later, Hurricane Maria followed in Irma's destructive footsteps. And Harvard University biologist Colin Donihue happened to be there a few days before the hurricanes blew through. ""The Turks and Caicos islands is home to a couple of different endemic species of lizard, that's lizards that are only found there. We were interested in one in particular, called Anolis scriptus, the Turks and Caicos anole."" The mission of that first expedition, before the two hurricanes, was to assay the lizard population in anticipation of a program to eradicate the islands of invasive rats—which threaten the lizards. This work included taking detailed measurements of the bodies of lizards they trapped and released. The researchers intended to return several years later, after the rats were gone, to re-assess the lizards. But that plan changed. “We realized after the hurricanes had come through that we had a really serendipitous opportunity to test this question of whether hurricanes can act as agents of natural selection on wild populations in their path. Now this had never really been asked before, because hurricanes are just really hard to predict…we just happened to be in the right place at the right time to have that baseline data."" Which is why he and his team returned to the archipelago…just six weeks after his first visit. They expected that lizards with longer limbs and larger toepads would be the ones better able to cling to trees and therefore more likely to survive the storms. And they were almost right. Longer front legs and larger toepads indeed helped. But shorter hindlimbs were actually better. The results are in the journal Nature. [Colin M. Donihue, et al. Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard ] To figure out these counterintuitive findings, the researchers conducted an experiment in a hotel room. They rounded up some lizards, gave them a perch, and used a leafblower to mimic the effects of high winds. They set up a net to catch any lizards that lost their grip. As the artificial wind blew, the lizards moved so the perch took most of the air flow. But their hind legs would stick out—and if those rear limbs stuck out too far, they acted as sails. ""Eventually those back legs were blown off the perch, and the lizards were just holding on with their front two legs. And they could only hold on like that for so long as the wind speed increased further and further, until they were blown off the perch and into the nets."" So shorter back legs gave a survival advantage. A trait that might be passed on to the next lizard generation. —Jason G.

Mahita Gajanan,"This year’s hurricane season is going to be strong and slightly above the average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in its 2018 Atlantic hurricane season forecast. According to the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, there’s a 75% chance that the 2018 hurricane season will be mostly normal, or a little stronger. Here’s what we know about the 2018 hurricane season predictions: When does hurricane season start? The Atlantic hurricane season starts on June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30 — though it usually peaks between August and September. The official start date for hurricane season hasn’t seemed to matter much in recent years. In fact, there was at least one named storm prior to June 1 four times in the last six years, according to The Weather Channel. What are the 2018 hurricane season predictions? The NOAA said there’s a 70% likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms forming this year. Of those, five to nine of the storms will form into hurricanes, with winds of 74 miles per hour or above. One to four of the storms could turn into major hurricanes, reaching above a category 3, with winds at 111 miles per hour or higher. The rate hovers around the average hurricane rate, according to the NOAA. Forecasters said in an average season, there are about 12 named storms, of which six turn into hurricanes, including three major hurricanes. How bad was hurricane season in 2017? The 2017 hurricane season saw 12 named storms devastate several areas throughout the U.S. More than 100 people died in the storms last year, making it the 17th deadliest hurricane season since 1990. By the end of the 2017 hurricane season, the storms had caused an estimated $200 billion in damage, according to the NOAA. Among the most devastating major storms were Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma. Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in southeast Texas last August, flooding countless homes and causing multiple deaths in its first days. The storm left at least 300,000 people without power with rain reaching up to nearly 50 inches. Shortly after Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston and surrounding areas in Texas, Hurricane Irma hit the Caribbean, battering the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, The British Virgin Islands and St. Martin. The storm was quickly followed by Hurricane Jose, which brought even more destruction to the area. The islands had barely any time to recover before Hurricane Maria blew threw in September, causing massive destruction to Puerto Rico. Millions of people were left without power, which came back slowly over the next three months. The death toll, initially reported to be 64, is thought to be higher than official counts. According to independent reviews, the actual death toll in Puerto Rico exceeded 1,000 people.",According to the NOAA,2018-05-24T16:27:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",2018 Is Going to Be Another Bad Hurricane Season.

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rebounded from a near 45-year low last week, but remained below a level that is associated with a tightening labor market. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Feb. 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. Claims fell to 216,000 in mid-January, which was the lowest level since January 1973. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 230,000 in the latest week. Last week marked the 154th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The tighter labor market is starting to exert upward pressure on wage growth, which will over time add to inflation pressures. The Labor Department said claims for Maine were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal, months after the territories were slammed by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 228,500. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 1.94 million in the week ended Feb. 3. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 5,750 to 1.94 million.

BAN KI-MOON and FRANCIS SUAREZ,"We have also learned that there is strength in numbers. Miami can access a wealth of resources, including sea level rise projections, thanks to its membership in regional bodies like the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. The city has also gained a broader perspective on urban resilience challenges and approaches by joining global networks such as the Global Commission on Climate Adaptation, where we both serve as board members, and 100 Resilient Cities. 
Finally, we have learned that effective adaptation is a collective endeavor. It requires a holistic, long-term approach that takes into account the needs of our citizens today and in the future. This requires robust and meticulous long-term planning, informed investment in resilient infrastructure, adapting land use and building policies to address the climate challenge, advancing new transportation solutions, educating and informing citizens about climate change, training and mobilizing volunteers during emergencies, informing private property owners of climate risks, and forging partnerships with research institutions and business innovators. As this long list makes clear, there isnt a single aspect of our daily lives that isnt affected by climate change.
Perhaps one of the reasons there is so little investment in adaptation is the lack of financial incentives. Unlike a wind farm, for example, that can earn a steady return for investors, the monetary benefits of adaptation are less straightforward. Investing in resilience protects businesses and communities from devastating losses, so it must be measured in the lives saved and businesses that remain open. We are only now learning how to quantify these benefits to communities. Floridas Division of Emergency Management, for example, calculated that projects to reduce wind and water damage avoided $81 million in losses when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016, while costing only $19 million to carry out. The projects included raising buildings, improving drainage, and buying and demolishing properties in vulnerable areas
That is why leadership, particularly from city governments like Miamis, is so important in driving investment in adaptation. After Hurricane Irma in September 2017 one of the costliest in United States history, leaving a $50 billion trail of destruction there was both a moral and a fiscal obligation to act. Thats why two months later, Miami voters approved the $400 million Miami Forever Bond.
The program is the citys answer to the shortfall of investment in adaptation. It brings together city planners, private sector innovators and citizens to build a stronger, more resilient future for Miami. Almost half this amount is being invested in flood defenses and other measures to combat the effects of rising sea levels. The remaining funds will be invested in affordable housing, tree planting, road work and an innovative approach to urban landscape design that will allow residents to continue enjoying waterfront access while improving drainage and sea wall defenses.","In 2017, voters agreed to finance adaptation efforts through property taxes. Now the first phase of those projects is underway.",2019-02-20T20:50:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Miami Battles Rising Seas,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/opinion/ban-ki-moon-miami-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/opinion/20moonWeb/20moonWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Irma,1
Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Not even a week has passed since Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm, obliterating much of the infrastructure in its path. Despite the fair warning before impact, the state Department of Corrections failed to evacuate most of its prison facilities. Now that the storms rolled through and road access has allowed the state to assess the damage Michael inflicted, the Department of Corrections announced Sunday and Monday it was evacuating a total of more than 4,000 inmates from three facilities in northern Florida. The state hasnt clarified the conditions of specific facilities, but its press releases note that all of the facilities sustained significant damage to roofs and security infrastructure. Including the 850 inmates evacuated before the storm, nine prisons have now had their nearly 5,000 inmates moved out of harms way. The state told Earther that other facilities in the area suffered minor damage, none of which has impacted housing or security, and that all incarcerated people have had access to meals and drinking water. None of this, however, is enough to quell the fears and concerns family members have for their loved ones who are incarcerated in the state. Deandra Cram, 52, has a 22-year-old son doing time at the Apalachee Correctional Institution, West Unit in Sneads, Florida, which wasnt evacuated though it sat in the storms path. Cram told Earther shes been in touch with her son over the phone and he alleges the state isnt feeding inmates or providing them with safe drinking water. Shes worried the conditions he describes will fuel a riot. When asked for comment on these allegations, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections emphasized that all inmates continue to have access to food and water and referred us to the states most recent press release for additional information. What would they do if all those prisoners were killed? Would they care? Because theyre criminals, would they care? They forget theyre someones family. I just think they dont care. Ive been through Hurricane Irma, and they told me to evacuate or else, Cram told Earther. I feel like their [my sons] rights have been violated by not having that same opportunity. Theresa Guarino-Cruz, 49, isnt lucky enough to be in communication with her 29-year-old son, who is located at the Northwest Florida Reception Center in Chipley, another prison that was not evacuated but sat closer to the edge of the hurricanes path. Her son used to call about every day to speak to his son, Guarino-Cruzs grandson. Now, she has to face a questioning 7-year-old who doesnt understand why daddy wont call. Colleen Millett, 51, also has a son at this facility. She got in touch with her 27-year-old son a day before the hurricane hit. He told her both sides of his dorm had been boarded up, but theres been no news since the storm. She hates the uncertainty, the wondering and worrying about how her son is doing. The Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) has evacuated six of its facilities, amounting to about Read more Read I feel that [the Florida Department of Corrections] failed me, my son, and every other inmate, their families, and staff members by choosing to not relocate them with the approaching hurricane that was notably increasing in strength and said to be of catastrophic intensity, Millett wrote to Earther in an email. I am desperate for information on my sons well being as well as the conditions that he and so many others are living in. Hurricanes spell health troubles even for those outside prison. The situation for those behind bars almost never looks better.

Brian Benchoff,"2017, in case you don’t remember, was a terrible year for the Caribbean and Gulf coast. Hurricane Maria tore Puerto Rico apart, Harvey flooded Houston, Irma destroyed the Florida Keys, and we still haven’t heard anything from Saint Martin. There is, obviously, a problem to be solved here, and that problem is communications. Amateur radio only gets you so far, but for their Hackaday Prize entry, [Inventive Prototypes] is building an emergency communication system that anyone can use. It only needs a clear view of the sky, and you can use it to send SMS messages. It’s the PR-Holonet, and it’s something that’s already desperately needed. The basis for the PR-Holonet is built around an Iridium satellite modem. To date, satellite communication is the best way to get a message out to the world without any infrastructure. It’ll work in the middle of the Sahara, the depths of the Amazon, and conveniently anywhere that was just hit by a category five hurricane. Along with the Iridium modem, [Inventive Prototypes] is using standard, off-the-shelf equipment to turn that connection to a satellite network into something any smartphone can use. That means pulling out a Raspberry Pi, of course. But building a project for areas that were recently ravaged by hurricanes is no easy task. The enclosure it the key here, and [Inventive Prototypes] is using some great water-resistant, dust-proof junction boxes, solar panels, and a whole bunch of batteries to keep everything humming along.

Or so we thought. On Hunter's command, Echo bounded through the knee-high wet grass — so quickly, we soon lost sight of her. The GoPros were gone when Echo reappeared. We slogged through the field with the airport folks, with no luck. Until last week. The brown grass to the left of the plane is where the GoPros were lost. There is also a worker mowing the grass father out in the field. A look at the GoPros and dog harness that were found at RSW after 11 months. The video and cameras survived Irma and the mower.

GoPros have a reputation for toughness, but consider: These two went through Hurricane Irma. They weathered our wettest rainy season on record: nearly 80 inches. Miraculously, the big mowers didn't mash them. The straps show signs of little bite marks — or light grazing from the mowing gear. We’re not sure. Lessons learned?

Officials warn of life-threatening storm surges in both North and South Carolina as the hurricane moves towards land with maximum sustained wind speeds of 100mph (155 km/h). More than 100,000 homes are already without power as weather conditions begin to worsen. Officials have warned the storm has the potential to kill ""a lot of people"" amid risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding. More than a million people along the coastlines of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate. Thousands had taken shelter in emergency facilities by Thursday night. Photographs showed residents crowded into corridors with blankets on inflatable mattresses and mats. What is the latest? Conditions deteriorated throughout Thursday as wind speeds gradually strengthened in coastal areas. Some areas of North Carolina saw almost a foot of rain just a few hours, and footage showed sea levels begin to surge in land. Media caption BBC on the ground as Hurricane Florence arrives For now Hurricane Florence remains a category two storm, with no significant weakening expected before the hurricane's eye makes landfall on Friday morning. The National Hurricane Centre (NHC) says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Media caption Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see,"" Fema administrator Brock Long told a news conference on Thursday morning. He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. How bad is it expected to get? The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday. Wind speeds are only expected to weaken on Saturday as the storm moves slowly across land. Meteorologists have warned floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) in areas as some rivers see their flows ""reversed"". Media caption People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Officials have warned restorations to electricity could take days or even weeks. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned people: ""Today the threat becomes a reality."" Emergency workers are arriving from other parts of the US to aid in rescues. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""

Is global warming to blame? The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas.

ABC News,"No tarps, no cots, and less than 200 blue roofs. That is what the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s (FEMA)'s warehouse in Puerto Rico looked like as Hurricane Maria made landfall in Sept. 2017. The vital supplies had been siphoned off elsewhere when Hurricane Irma had slammed into the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting need for assistance. In its after-action report, FEMA’s leadership admits that it “could have better anticipated that the severity of hurricane s Irma and Maria would cause long-term, significant damage” to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An aerial view shows the flooded neighbourhood of Juana Matos in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Catano, Puerto Rico, Sept. 22, 2017. FEMA pointed out that Puerto Rico’s government has not yet achieved a level of preparedness commensurate with much of the U.S. mainland. In the first 72 hours after Maria’s landfall, FEMA had “little information” about the status of the island’s infrastructure. week after the storm, FEMA still lacked key information, including vital details like the status of more than half of the island’s water treatment facilities and nearly half of the island's hospitals. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on the morning of Sept, 20, 2017, plunging the island into complete darkness, causing $100 billion in damage and claimed the lives of countless people. In the wake of Hurricane Irma, FEMA moved more than 80% of its inventory from the Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse in Puerto Rico to the Port of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That left the only FEMA warehouse in Puerto Rico with zero cots, zero tarps, less than 98,000 meals and less than 70,000 liters of water -- all as Hurricane Maria barreled towards the island. In a letter attached to the report, FEMA Administrator Brock Long wrote that “the hurricanes also showed that governments need to be better prepared with their own supplies, to have pre-positioned contracts with enforcement mechanisms, and to be ready for the financial implications of a disaster."" The agency report cites the island’s geographic distance from mainland U.S. as well as its fiscal pressures for its lack of critical infrastructure management and decreased funding for emergency management. The report also pins blame on an agency they say “entered the hurricane season with a force strength less than its target, resulting in staffing shortages across the incidents.” The agency needed over a thousand more people personnel to hit a target set for the fiscal year. FEMA defines its force strength as its workforce that has completed the administrative requirements for deployment. In the aftermath of Maria, FEMA’s Logistics Supply Chain Management System records that tracked much needed food and water supplies in real time lagged because of a lack of trained personnel on the ground. Less than a fifth of the trained staff were in Texas and Florida responding to other hurricanes. In a little over a month, the federal agency responded to three major hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria – which did a combined $265 billion in damage. Maria represents FEMA’s longest sustained air mission of food and water delivery to date. FEMA also acknowledges that the agency's reliance on cellular and broadband communications fell remarkably short of facilitating vital communications between rescuers and survivors during some of the most consequential early days of the storm for Puerto Rico. Among a number of such issues, some of the satellite phones that were sent to Puerto Rico did not work, and many that received those phones did not know how to use them. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that “With every response or recovery effort, we take with us lessons learned that help build a nation-wide culture of preparedness and shape the way FEMA and the emergency management community respond to and recover from future disasters.” The Puerto Rico Governor’s Office tells ABC News they are still reviewing the report. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a critic of the federal government’s response to the storm said in a statement to ABC News,“The report proves what was evident to all in Puerto Rico."" ""FEMA was unprepared and they lacked a sense of urgency, which resulted in neglect, which in turn resulted in the loss of lives,"" she said. ""It is quite troubling that they were not able to adapt their operating procedures to our reality and, from what the report says-they did not even learn from their past mistakes.” Cruz is also seeking the appointment of independent commission to “ensure those responsible are held accountable and ensure future mistakes like this do not happen again.“","No tarps, no cots, and less than 200 blue roofs.

HUMANKIND Last Video Next Video Turbo (Photo: Handout) NAPLES, Fla. — Janice Dimitriou remembers the exact day and time her short-haired tabby cat disappeared. On Sept. 17 at 9 p.m. ET, Turbo fell out a hotel room window and ran into the North Carolina woods the night before his humans were supposed to return to Collier County after evacuating Florida for Hurricane Irma. “He’d been through a lot,” Dimitriou said. “He was out of his element. He didn’t fall far, but he was terrified and took off in the night in a strange place.” Dimitriou and her husband spent an extra two days in the town of Highlands looking for their cat. They put up laminated signs with Turbo’s picture and called local veterinary offices, the ASPCA and a radio station to ask people to keep their eyes peeled for a gray-haired cat with light eyes. They walked the neighborhood where they had been staying and talked to neighbors.

He never liked to go outside. He must have been terrified.” A little more than three months later, the Dimitrious got a call they had been hoping for but hadn’t entirely expected. Jim Grove, a Sarasota, Fla., man who was spending Christmas and New Year's with his husband at their second home in Highlands, N.C., called the couple and said he thought he spotted Turbo. Janice Dimitriou and Turbo. (Photo: Andy Dimitriou) ""I started seeing this cat wandering our neighborhood,"" Grove said. ""It was unusual to see a cat out there by itself in the dead of winter. I went out to the front step and called out to it, but it ran into the woods across the street."" He asked his neighbors about the cat, and they all said it appeared to be homeless. The neighbors said they had tried to feed him, but he always ran. On Dec. 28, Grove and his husband went to downtown Highlands and saw a ""lost cat"" sign in a store window. Grove thought he recognized the cat in the photo as the one he saw wandering his neighborhood. According to the sign, the cat disappeared three months prior from a bed and breakfast across the highway from the mountain on which their home was built. ""I thought the cat may have found a way to cross the highway and go up the mountain,"" Grove said. ""This is Pumpkin, right, and Turbo deciding to ride together in one carrier on our evacuation even though they each had their own. Both rescue kitties. Pumpkin is 14 and Turbo is 2,"" Dimitriou wrote. (Photo: Submitted) Grove's husband didn't want Grove to get the owners' hopes up, but he knew he had to call. He kept in touch with Dimitriou and set up a trap to try to capture the cat. A few days later, Grove sent Dimitriou a text message with a photo of the cat when it turned up on the walkway of their front porch. She sent a message back saying, ""OMG. That is Turbo."" The Dimitrious had returned from spending Christmas visiting family in Chicago and weren’t looking forward to returning to the cold, but they wanted their cat back. The couple drove 11 hours back to North Carolina with their other cat, Pumpkin. On Jan. 2, they trapped Turbo with the help of Grove and a professional trapper. “He hissed, showed his teeth and lunged at me,” Dimitriou said. “He was in survival mode. We took him to a vet up there to have him treated for fleas.” Dimitriou said that was the only treatment Turbo needed. “It felt like a miracle that he survived that long,” Dimitriou said. “Almost three-and-a-half months in that weather. He survived 15-inch snowfall.” Turbo (Photo: Handout) The vet gave Turbo some tranquilizers for the drive home, and about two weeks later, Dimitriou said he’s getting better. “He’s very shy and not 100% trusting, but he’s getting back to being the way we remember him,” she said. Dimitriou is grateful to the people in Highlands who kept an eye out for Turbo and left food and water out for him over the last several months. She’s especially grateful to Grove. “Every day, I’d say an affirmation and visualize that he’d be back home,” Dimitriou said. “It’s such a wonderful thing that it came to fruition. There are good intentions and good people out there.” Grove and Dimitriou said they both believe in the power of prayer and positive affirmation. She prayed every day for Turbo's return, and every time Grove saw the cat appear, he prayed they could catch him so Turbo could make his way back home. ""It's amazing how it all came about,"" Grove said. ""It was an honor to be part of it and to be a small part of Janice's answered prayer."" Follow Alexi C.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Governor Rick Scott warned state residents that ""this storm could kill you"" Powerful Hurricane Michael is set to make landfall in Florida later on Wednesday, forcing mass evacuations in the southern US state. A category three storm with winds near 120mph (193km/h), Michael is expected to strengthen further when it hits the Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend in the north-west, meteorologists warn. More than 370,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in Florida. Florida, Alabama and Georgia have declared states of emergency. At least 13 people have reportedly died in Central America due to the storm. What are the latest developments? In its bulletin, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said: ""Strengthening is expected overnight and on Wednesday, and Michael is forecast to be near category four strength when it makes landfall."" The NHC warns that some regions of Florida may see storm surges of up to 12ft (4m). It said that at 00:00 GMT on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was about 255 miles south of Panama City, Florida. Michael is currently moving northwards at 12mph. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Residents put plywood up in Port St Joe, Florida ""Weakening is expected after landfall as Michael moves across the south-eastern United States,"" the NHC added. Florida Governor Rick Scott called Michael ""a monstrous storm"" and urged residents to listen to officials. ""Let me be clear - the storm surge that our coastal counties are facing is deadly,"" the governor tweeted. ""Do not ignore warning from local officials - this storm could kill you. We can rebuild your house, we cannot rebuild your life."" Despite the warnings, local officials believe a far fewer number of people have in fact moved away. Schools and state offices in the area are to remain shut this week. On Tuesday, Gov Scott said he activated 2,500 Florida National Guard troops in preparation for the storm. Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama warned of possible tornados. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday: ""We are very well prepared for the incoming hurricane."" Image copyright AFP Residents face frightening ordeal By BBC's Gary ODonoghue in Florida Adrian Mahangos hopes he is one of the lucky ones. Sitting outside his home, reading a magazine, less than 100 yards from the water's edge in Wynnehaven, he knows Hurricane Michael is now due to make landfall 50 or 60 miles to his east. Mr Mahangos is not going anywhere. His house is 11ft above sea level, and if the 4ft-surge predicted for this part of the coast goes no higher, then he's confident his newly-built home will survive. Just an hour along the coast, it's different. The aptly named Lullwater Beach, just west of Panama City Beach, is quiet at the moment, but this whole stretch is looking a possible surge of up to 13ft. A man in the distance is gathering sand from the beach while it's still light, and pouring it into trash bags - making do with what's at hand to protect from the water. Local officials are warning that not nearly enough people have evacuated as they would wish. Florida is used to storms, but the Panhandle, with its low-lying coastal strip and scattered communities, hasn't seen anything this strong for more than a dozen years. Those that remain will be facing a frightening ordeal. Where has Hurricane Michael hit so far? The storm caused widespread destruction in Central America over the weekend, where at least 13 people have been reported dead. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Images on social media showed evacuating families wading through water to get to safety. Image copyright EPA Image caption Western Cuba, including Havana, was struck by Hurricane Michael on Monday Parts of western Cuba, which was hit by the storm on Monday, were forecast to receive up to a foot of rain. Offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated workers, halting nearly a fifth of daily production. Five drilling rigs have been moved out of the storm's path, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland. Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""

Laura Silver,"When more than 700 students and staff from an American university in the Caribbean were unexpectedly relocated to the small English city of Preston in October, they may as well have been moving to another planet. St Martin, a small Caribbean island just south of Antigua, is about as far from Preston, Lancashire, as you could imagine, and not just because 4,000 miles of ocean lies between them. The American University of the Caribbean is based in the south of the island, in the Dutch territory Sint Maarten. It’s a tropical beach paradise where the sea glistens with year-round sunshine by day and the streets sparkle with frenzied nightlife after dark. Fresh fish fill the hundreds of restaurants scattered around its beachy edges. Preston, once the heart of the UK’s now largely defunct textile industry, lies in the North West of England. It regularly sees a handful of tourists with a taste for brutalist architecture mingle with the pensioners and schoolkids at the city’s concrete bus station, although you'd be wise to bring an umbrella there since around a metre of rain falls on the city every year. Its best-known dish is “butter pie”, a potato, onion, and pastry concoction originally cooked up to feed Catholics on a Friday when they were avoiding meat. St Martin was one of the hardest-hit islands when the 185 mph winds of Hurricane Irma tore through the Caribbean in September, flattening communities and killing 134 people. As a result, hundreds of trainee doctors who were studying there ended up in Preston, where they are continuing their studies at the University of Central Lancashire, or UCLan. Grey, drizzling clouds hung over the grand Victorian railway station, where a traditional pie stall stands alongside a more recently introduced Starbucks, when BuzzFeed News arrived in Preston for a Thanksgiving dinner put on by UCLan for displaced students. We spoke to some of the trainee doctors settling into life in the old industrial north over a traditional American feast of roast turkey, mashed potatoes, and pecan pie. Back in September, when AUC students prepared to return to school after the summer break, hurricanes were the last thing on their minds. They were more concerned with settling into their apartments and soaking up as much sun as they could before another gruelling stint of studies than they were about the possibility of a deadly storm. “I had to take two flights to get there, so I was already exhausted and my hair was frizzing up in the humidity,” Madhura Mahapatra, a first-year medical student at AUC from Chicago, told BuzzFeed News. She was wearing a thick wool tartan scarf and heavy boots, and said she loves St Martin’s sticky climate. “The fact that we could go to the beach to tan or celebrate post exams was one of the coolest things.” She had been aware of the risks of hurricane season, but as Irma began to make its initial approach, she shrugged off her parents’ concerns about her returning to the island. “I kept telling them, 'No, it’s fine, others are overreacting by cancelling their tickets. I’m just going to fly out, I don’t want to miss class.'” She speaks with a calm confidence that will no doubt prove invaluable to her as a doctor one day. “My parents know that I have a good head on my shoulders and don’t tend to panic, so they were like, ‘If you say so, we trust you,’” she said. Even when she found out before setting off from Chicago that the first couple of days of classes would be cancelled, Mahapatra was unperturbed. “I ended up flying, and the stewardess was like, ‘Oh, you’re flying in ? You guys are brave souls,’” she said. When the university summoned students and staff to shelter for a few days in AUC’s auditorium, built to withstand a category 5 hurricane, many still saw it as little more than a precaution. “I thought, ‘How do you pack for a hurricane?’” Mahapatra said. “I have a Keurig machine – I was thinking, Do I bring that if I want coffee? Do I pack sandwiches? “The weather was still fine, it was beautiful sunny skies, so we were like, ‘Eh, it’s probably not even going to happen.’” Mahapatra wondered if mentally dissociating herself from danger was her way of coping. “I like to downplay a lot of things,” she said. “I guess I just didn’t understand the reality of it.” Rahoul Patel, who grew up in Illinois and studied in San Diego before arriving at AUC two semesters ago, had felt equally detached from the possibility of danger. “When I originally started at AUC, people told me, ‘Watch out for the hurricanes!’, but you never really processed it,” he said. Despite his parents’ protestations, Patel “didn’t think twice” about returning to the island for school, especially as the hurricane was initially predicted to be far less severe than it ended up being. “I just thought if it comes we’ll all leave, or it won’t be that bad,” he said, later noting that the students at AUC were in a much more privileged position than those who live on the island permanently. “You never think it will be that bad until you see what it can do.” When warnings emerged on the Sunday before the hurricane hit that it was likely to be a category 5, Patel and his friends were among the many who tried and failed to get off the island. “Immediately we all went to the airport and were looking online to get flights – we didn’t think we’d make it through the hurricane,” he said. “It was too late. Everything was booked, and then everything got cancelled, and anyway, if you wanted to fly to New York it was several thousand dollars. You can’t just pay that.” Rushing back to AUC’s shelter, Patel began to understand the severity of the situation. “It was scary. At this point they were saying it was going to be the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic that they’d ever seen, and we’re in one building that’s supposed to be safe for category 5, but they also said that the strongest it had ever experienced was category 4 so they were kind of testing it.” Mahapatra described the shelter, where hundreds of students, AUC staff, and some local residents took cover, as a “huge chaos of humans and pets” when she arrived. Many brought their families and friends along with them, and AUC also offered shelter to a few local residents who arrived as the storm began to draw closer, gaining strength. But it was only when Irma fully descended on the island in the early hours of the Wednesday morning, whirring at the windows almost two days after they initially shuttered in, that fear finally kicked in for her. “It started raining and the clouds were an ominous purply black colour,” Mahapatra remembered. “At 4.15am the storm hit. I was sleeping and there was this quiet mumbling.” As the torrential rain and thundering wind swirled outside the reinforced auditorium, before suddenly quieting as the eye of the storm passed over, a sense of panic began to spread. “I went to the door and took a video of the actual eye and it was silent,” Mahapatra said. “It was almost too eerie of a silence, where you’re just sitting there waiting for it to hit us again.” Outside the window Mahapatra remembers seeing the usually manicured grounds of AUC shrouded in thick wet darkness. “It was like this unwavering fog that sits and looms over you,” she said. Some students had decided to stay in their accommodation during the hurricane and ran to the auditorium in fear when the eye of the storm arrived. “Their ceilings were sunk in, water was everywhere, and they were just panicking. There was a girl who came in who was just hyperventilating and having a panic attack.” As the storm started up again, the shelter was tested to its limits. “There was water that started seeping in from one of the doors, and they said, 'This is the only door that’s not going to last very long, so it might blow and we might get sucked into 225 mph wind,'” Mahapatra said. “I was just like, I’m 10 feet away from this door, am I going to be OK?” She said the experience was a reminder that even if her Sint Maarten apartment was damaged, she was lucky to have another home in the US. “You really had to sit there and think about all the things you take for granted on a daily basis.” “This building was built for a category 5 so it gave us confidence of it holding out,” said Jacob Kulyn, a Californian second-year medical student at AUC. “But people on that island were in normal homes that have just vanished, gone.” While at the shelter, Kulyn, keen to use his expertise in the aftermath of the storm, joined a group of people with practical medical experience, including parents who were physicians and had not yet returned home after dropping students back after summer break, as they coordinated efforts to help the injured when the storm passed. “I knew if the hurricane hit I wanted to stay on the island to help out in whatever capacity I could,” he said, adding that he’d worked as emergency medical technician before beginning his training to be a doctor at AUC. “As soon as we saw the path coming towards us directly the night before, we knew it was going to be bad and we knew people were probably going to be injured. You could hear trees and cars flying by because the wind speed was 185 mph, with gusts up to 220."" After the storm the team of volunteers went outside and helped whoever they could. “Some people had mangled, broken hands and needed sutures, so we assisted with that,” Kulyn said. “On one particular night we dragged a 300-pound unconscious lady out of a hotel that had lost power. She was a diabetic and had no drugs, so we ended up dragging her back to the school and the doctors there took care of her."" Many people who weren’t harmed by the storm itself were injured by the wreckage. “People were stepping on a nail or touching glass,” Kulyn said. “When you’ve got one power generator, and the water’s not running, there’s risk of infection. You get a splinter and all of a sudden it becomes a big deal.” There were around 700 people in AUC’s shelter after those who had lost homes, or needed treatment for injuries, began to arrive, joining the students and staff who were already there with friends and family. “We eventually became a big welfare operation in the course of the four days we were there.” After the hurricane, most of St Martin was devastated, and many who lived there have lost everything, including their homes. “There were palm trees, and then there weren’t,” Mahapatra said. “There were lampposts and then there weren’t. There were buildings and then there weren’t. Cars had smashed upside down into other cars. It just looked like a zombie apocalypse.” Two people died on the Dutch side of the island, according to the government of Sint Maarten, and the damage is estimated to be $1,8 billion. Soldiers patrolled the streets of Sint Maarten to help counter the possibility of lawlessness as food supplies rapidly dwindled. “In a state of panic and martial law, people can change,” Kulyn said. “People were looking to defend themselves if they needed to. It was a little bit scary, but as long as everyone went along their own way it was OK.” The students joined tourists and foreign nationals who were evacuated in the days immediately after the storm on military planes via nearby Puerto Rico. Again, they had been fortunate. Following the storm, commercial flights were limited and often expensive, plus the cost of relocating forced many local people to stay, regardless of whether their home survived the storm. Patel recalled a sense of guilt at knowing he was in a much better position than those who had lived on the island for much longer than him and his fellow students. “We knew we were going to be rescued, and we’re spoiled, so we think, OK, when,” he said. “But the people on the island knew they were never going to be rescued.” Emmalexis Velasquez, a press officer for the local government in Sint Maarten, told the New Yorker magazine of her frustration as she watched foreign nationals be evacuated by their home countries, while local waited for help. “By day two or day three, after the storm, [the radio said] all this aid was coming, but then night comes, and days go by, but there is still no aid,” she said. “You can hear the helicopter, and you saw the helicopters, and maybe you saw one or two marine ships, but you’re not seeing any soldiers coming to your door, like, ‘Hello, hello! Is anyone here?’” The AUC students either travelled to Chicago, where the university also has a base, or returned to family homes across the country while they awaited news of what would happen next. “The first thing I did was just shower and just go to my bed and just lay there,” Mahapatra said. “I have never been more grateful to just sleep in my own bed.” Much of their university was intact, having been built to withstand even a hurricane as severe as Irma, but with communication, electricity, water, and travel still highly restricted on the island, staff decided returning immediately wasn’t an option. “I said to Dr Julie Taylor, who’s my second in command, 'Go find us somewhere else to have medical school!'” Dr Heidi Chumley, executive dean of AUC, told us. “We started looking to the entire world.” AUC has many connections with health services globally, and works with eight hospital trusts in the UK, including the East Lancashire Hospital Trust – a clinical partner of UCLan. “Very quickly UCLan raised their hand and said they would like to help us, which was unbelievably amazing,” Chumley said. Lisa Banks, director of student services at UCLan, had just finished welcoming thousands of new permanent undergraduates when she received word that she would need to find emergency housing and transport to 700 AUC students and staff as well as their accompanying families in some cases. “I got an email on our welcome Sunday saying, 'Do you think you could find room for 900 people in Preston next week?'” Banks told us. “I think I laughed – like, no, someone’s kidding, you’re joking.” When Banks realised the request was entirely serious, her project management skills went into full swing. “My first thought was, Right, let’s get a pen out and do a to-do list, ” she said. Her already exhausted staff were more than happy to help with the task of transporting and housing students, as well as making any specialist arrangements for the health conditions some had, or finding local school places for those bringing kids. Banks managed to broker a deal with a local property developer with newly built, unfilled private student accommodation available, allowing the university to offer the students an affordable place where they could all live together. This was a relief to many students who had feared high rental costs in London when the UK was originally mooted as a temporary location for their studies, Chumley said. For students and staff who brought families with them, and for whom student accommodation would have been unsuitable, Banks was able to find individual houses near the university in Preston city centre. Chumley said students cheered when they were told they would be going to the UK, despite only having a few days' notice. “For me I felt like they could take me anywhere as long as I can continue my education, because if you take a semester off, that can look really bad years down the road,” Patel said. Nine days after UCLan offered itself as a temporary home to AUC’s medical school, the students flew over. “It was a big challenge, but UCLan staff are just fantastic, they’re so friendly – and if you give them a challenge like that, rescuing people who’ve been displaced in a hurricane, they just all stepped up,” Banks said. “I think that’s why so many people stepped up to help, because it was something they could actually do rather than watch it on the telly wondering what they could do.” AUC now shares Preston’s teaching rooms and equipment, running its own timetable during evenings and weekends when UCLan facilities are not already being used. AUC had worked to secure temporary working visas for its staff, but many of them initially had to teach their new classes in Lancashire over a video link as they waited for them to come through. Students told us they were immensely grateful for the way UCLan and AUC handled the transition, especially after such a traumatic experience. “We were really shocked that there was a university out there so far through the semester who would take us,” said Stanley Tsui, who had just entered his first semester at AUC. “We’re super thankful we’re even given this opportunity.” But Banks admitted it hadn’t always felt as though things would run so smoothly. “Security made me a badge at the time that said ‘Lisa Banks winging it’,” she laughed. A relatively smooth transition or otherwise, moving from the Caribbean to the damp North West of England would likely prove a shock to the system for anyone. Many had to buy thick winter coats when they arrived. “Coming from a sunny Caribbean island to all of a sudden maybe only getting a peek of the sun every day struck us most,” Tsui said. Originally from San Francisco, he completed his undergraduate degree in Los Angeles prior to arriving at AUC. “We’re just not used to it,” he laughed. “It’s dark here!” Mahapatra said she had travelled around much of Europe before, but not to the UK, and expected to find “yellow wellies, grey skies, and umbrellas” when she arrived at UCLan. Nonetheless she’s found Preston charming, 4.30pm sunsets and all. “I think it has a sort of bleak romance,” she said. “It’s a little bit dirtier than I expected, but it’s got a strange sort of quaint character to it.” Kulyn imagined to be something like he’d seen onscreen in Sherlock Holmes films. “That’s what I was picturing, I just didn’t know,” he said. Preston hasn’t been quite what he expected, but he’s found the locals “super welcoming” and has even begun to adapt to the nuances of Britain. “I’ve started saying 'pub' and ‘bloody hell'!” Patel was a little more clued up on the UK, having visited family in London most Christmases and spent some of his undergraduate years at the University of Edinburgh. Still, Preston wasn’t without its surprises, in particular Brits’ penchant for curry. “There’s so much Indian food here – I saw it on pizza, I saw it in Subway,” he said. “I’m like, that’s awesome!” The students spoke of their deep gratitude to the people of Preston who had made them feel welcome since they arrived, not least at a civic reception put on for them at Preston Guild Hall. “We hope they enjoy their time in our city,” said Preston's mayor, Councillor Brian Rollo. The AUC and UCLan student unions have teamed up to fundraise for school supplies to be sent to Sint Maarten. The Thanksgiving dinner BuzzFeed News visited was a tradition at theuniversity in Sint Maarten that staff were determined to hold in the UK too. All AUC’s students are scheduled to return to Sint Maarten in 2018, in either January or May. Some are nervous: “I used to study in the auditorium where we sheltered because it’s open 24 hours,” Mahapatra said. “Just sitting there, and the sights, the smells, the sounds – I don’t know if I’ll be able to sit there and fully concentrate and study the same way.” Patel also admitted to feeling a little anxious. “It’s like, is there going to be another hurricane? You just don’t want to be around water so soon, you know?” But all four students we met were eager to return. Almost three months after Irma, some businesses are beginning to reopen, although the island’s infrastructure remains fractured despite local efforts to rebuild a place that previously attracted around 2 million tourists a year. Having made the island their home before being uprooted to England, they feel they owe it to the community that had welcomed them to return and help with relief efforts. “They’ve done everything, they’ve fed us, provided discounts for us with their businesses, they’ve allowed us to stay in their apartments – now it’s like, we can’t just leave them,” Tsui said. “You have to go home. They’re like our family now, so I think it’s a good thing that we get to go back now, because we can help as much as possible while we study.” A sense of helplessness as he left Sint Maarten also factors strongly in Tsui’s keenness to return. “Even if you did help, there wasn’t much that you could do,” he said. “We donated all our food as we left, and whatever we had in our houses, but that was the extent of the help we could offer as students. “I know that when we go back we’ll do as much as we can to help the community. Now they need us more than ever, so it’s our duty.” Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

"USATODAY, USATODAY","Get ready for a major price hike for orange juice thanks to Hurricane Irma decimating much of Florida's orange crop. Experts say OJ prices could jump by as much as $2.30 per gallon. Wochit Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., whose district suffered massive citrus damage from Hurricane Irma. (Photo: File) WASHINGTON ­— Florida’s citrus growers can nearly taste the orange aid for which they’ve been thirsting. The latest $81 billion disaster relief bill House leaders have crafted would include $2.6 billion for hurricane-related agriculture relief. It's the third — and largest — funding request for the widespread damage inflicted since August on the Gulf Coast and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The measure needs approval by both houses of Congress and lawmakers Tuesday were still working to include it in a catch-all spending bill Congress is expected to approve before members leave at the end of this week for their holiday recess, But Sunshine State lawmakers are optimistic that Washington finally will deliver on its promise to help cover the $761 million in hurricane damage that Florida’s nationally iconic and economically substantial citrus industry suffered at the winds and rains of Irma. If the bill passes ""our growers can finally go get the help that they need to get them at least to next year,"" said Rep. Tom Rooney whose southern Florida district suffered massive citrus damage from Irma. ""Before yesterday, they were getting nothing."" If the House passes disaster relief, it moves on to the Senate where Florida's two senators — Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Marco Rubio — are pushing for citrus relief. Two previous rounds of disaster aid did not include any money for Florida's citrus crop, which was decimated by flooding and wind damage from Hurricane Irma in September. More than 421,000 acres of citrus groves across a state that produces about 70% of the nation's orange juice was destroyed. U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasters are predicting the 2017-18 crop will be the lowest in decades. Last month, the Trump administration proposed a third round of $44 billion in aid with no promise of citrus aide and only $1 billion for agriculture overall. But Florida and Texas lawmakers have been pressuring congressional leaders for more help for farmers and ranchers. When the bill was unveiled Monday night by House appropriators, it had grown to $81 billion and included $2.6 billion for agriculture that could be used to help Florida's citrus industry. The announcement was cheered by Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, whose office has estimated total hurricane-related losses to Florida's agriculture, including beef, dairy and aquaculture, at $2.5 billion. More: White House requests $44 billion in disaster relief for victims of hurricanes, wildfires More: Citrus growers turn to Congress for help after administration request leaves them out “Florida's farmers, ranchers and growers suffered unprecedented damage from Hurricane Irma, and today's announcement of proposed emergency funding for Florida agriculture is the first bit of good news we've heard in months,"" he said in a news release. Rooney said one of the stumbling blocks was trying to convince lawmakers in other parts of the country to rescue citrus farmers, many of whom did not buy crop insurance. He said those colleagues didn't understand that insurance for citrus was relatively meager, often covering no more than a quarter of losses, compared to other crops. So as part of the bill, citrus growers who apply for federal disaster aid must purchase at least two years of crop insurance, he said. In addition, lawmakers are committed to improving the program so farmers whose orange and grapefruit groves suffer damage from a future catastrophe get more back in return.

But it didn't always look this way. It might be hard to imagine cows ever being in this living room, but while this is a modern architectural structure now, it used to be a barn! The beautiful original wooden ceiling beams give it away. Irma, the owner, was also the architect in charge of the renovation and explains that having her family as the client was not an easy task. Two parents and three kids will have wildly different expectations and needs when it comes to home remodeling. But in the end, the family was able to work together and Irma designed a house that's a perfect fit for all who live inside. Though the home's interior is unarguably minimal and modern, it was important to Irma to respect the home's past as well as reflect its natural surroundings. She wanted to maintain the essence of the countryside while incorporating modern elements. The result is a house that feels like a nook in the middle of the mountains where everybody can relax and enjoy themselves. Apartment Therapy Survey: Our Style: Modern and minimal. I don't like to load the house with furniture. Less is more! Inspiration: Switzerland's modern country houses. Favorite Element: The chimney. Everybody loves it. Biggest Challenge: To convince my family to have a terrace! Nobody wanted it and now it's the favorite place for the family. What Friends Say: People love it. They are surprised at the size of the house. Biggest Embarrassment: There is a room next to the kitchen that we don't use at all. It would have been nice to have incorporated that space and have a bigger kitchen. Proudest DIY: The terrace! That was my idea and I fought for it. Biggest Indulgence: The chimney.

ABC News,"Today is the last day of the 2017 Atlantic Basin hurricane season, which has left hundreds dead and was the most active season since 2005, the year of Katrina. Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. This year had triple the usual amount of major hurricanes: six major hurricanes, as opposed to the norm of two. In total, there were 10 hurricanes this year and 17 named storms. For the first time on record, three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the U.S.: Harvey, Irma and Maria. September 2017, was the most active month on record for Atlantic hurricanes. Here are more facts and records about the 2017 hurricane season: Irma With winds reaching up to 185 mph, Hurricane Irma was the second-strongest hurricane in the Atlantic Basin in history. It set a world record for the longest-lasting, strongest cyclone. Irma was also the strongest storm to impact the Leeward Islands, on the border of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, in recorded history. The monster storm completely destroyed the Caribbean island of Barbuda with 185 mph winds; it was also the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1924 and the first to hit the Bahamas since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. When Hurricane Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, as a Category 4 hurricane, it still had winds up to 130 mph. It was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida since hurricane Charlie 2004. The hurricane's second landfall in Florida was on Marco Island as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115. GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Irma. Irma's path through Caribbean shows it hit the Virgin Islands, but missed direct landfall in Puerto Rico: GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Irma. Maria Hurricane Maria increased strength very rapidly, ramping up from a Category 1 storm to Category 5 in just 15 hours. At its strongest, Maria's winds reached 175 mph. Maria hit the island of Dominica on Sept. 18, the first Category 5 storm to make landfall there, with winds up to 160 mph. The island was nearly completely restored. On the island of St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Maria's winds gusted up to 137 mph. In Puerto Rico, winds gusted to 110 mph, in San Juan, and rainfall totaled 35 inches causing some rivers to rise 20 feet in just a few hours. On September 20, the storm made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 mph. Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928. GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Maria. Harvey Harvey produced the biggest rainfall total from a single storm in the U.S. on record: 51.88 inches. Rainfall in Port Arthur, Texas, broke records; more than two feet of rain fell in 24 hours. Harvey was the first Category 4 hurricane to hit Texas since 1961. It made landfall in Rockport, Texas, as with winds of 130 mph. Harvey made three landfalls in the U.S. -- two in Texas and one in Louisiana.

"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","Florence regained hurricane strength again Sunday and the massive storm could menace the East Coast later this week. USA TODAY The approaching danger presented by Hurricane Florence and the damage caused by Tropical Storm Gordon serve as reminders that September is the most active month for these kinds of powerful storms. And yet, FEMA Administrator Brock Long has warned that the United States doesn’t have a “culture of preparedness,’’ even after being hammered in 2017 by Harvey, Irma and Maria, the first time three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in U.S. territory on the same year. More: Florence regains strength as a hurricane: 'Plan for the worst, pray for the best' Related: Will growing scenes of hurricanes, wildfires and volcanoes make us a go-bag people? Long said being ready for a disaster requiresmore than storing food, water and supplies – having money saved for an emergency is vital, too – but those preventive measures can have a major impact, possibly meaning the difference between life and death. With hurricanes currently approaching U.S. land from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, here are several steps residents can take to protect themselves. The information comes from a variety of sources, including the American Red Cross, the National Hurricane Center, Ready.gov and weather.gov: • Put together an emergency kit: This is the first recommendation of the Red Cross, which lists some of the top essentials as water (a gallon per person per day for a minimum of three days), non-perishable food (also at least three days’ worth), medications and medical supplies, flashlights, extra batteries, a first-aid kit and a portable radio. Personal documents, cell phones with chargers, a can opener and at least one change of clothes also make the list. These necessities can all be assembled well before a hurricane hits. Also make sure the car’s in working order and with a full tank of gas, the cell phones are charged and the drug prescriptions have been filled. Keep important documents in a safe, accessible place, with copies of files loaded into a flash drive or into password-protected storage. Consider taking cellphone photos of key documents. • Board up all windows: Storm shutters provide the best protection, but a solid and less expensive alternative is attaching cut-to-fit plywood over the windows. Don’t fall for the myth that taping windows will protect the glass, as more than half of Americans believe, according to the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. That may offer some peace of mind but little else. Secure doors as well, especially garage doors, which tend to be the most vulnerable. • Bring in untethered items: Patio furniture and other loose items can become projectiles in strong winds. They should be stored inside. If it’s not safe to do so, as is the case with propane tanks, anchor them. Also, trim trees with branches that could damage the house, clean gutters and downspouts and move cars out of flood-prone areas. • Have a plan: Be aware of your area’s evacuation route and the location of local shelters. Come up with an emergency plan – accounting for any pets – and share it with the rest of the household. Everyone in the family should know what to do and how to contact each other if they’re away from the house in an emergency. Also share the plan with a friend or relative away from the storm area. Many shelters don’t accept animals, so people with pets and livestock should look into evacuating them ahead of time to a safe area. • Be careful when using a portable generator: Though generators can keep the lights on and the refrigerator running during a power outage, they come with some inherent risks. Generators should never be used indoors – not even in a garage or basement – and must be kept at least 30 feet from the house to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be lethal. And it’s not advisable to use a generator if the home has flooded, which increases the chances of electrocution. In addition, experts say the safest and most efficient way to use a generator is to have a qualified electrician install a transfer switch to feed power into the house. Backfeeding, the practice of plugging the generator directly into the home’s power outlets, is illegal and dangerous. • Know what to avoid: Don’t walk, drive or swim in flood waters if at all possible; they may be contaminated or hiding dangerous debris or a downed power line. Also stay away from beaches and riverbanks. If the power is out, rely on flashlights instead of candles for illumination. • Follow instructions: Evacuate immediately if told to do so by authorities, who may also ask you to shut down your power and/or water. Keep track of local news. Alert family and friends of your situation and whereabouts.

Hillary Hoffower,"Hurricane Michael is heading toward Florida's Gulf Coast, where it's expected to make landfall Wednesday. It's currently a Category 4, which the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines as a storm with winds running 130 to 156 miles per hour. As someone who grew up in hurricane territory — otherwise known as Florida — I can tell you this much: A Cat 4 hurricane is nothing to take lightly, especially when it's heading for an area that isn't usually faced with storms of that force. I've been through two Category 4 storms myself. The first, Hurricane Charley in 2004, was a beast with winds of 145 mph — and the eye passed right through where I was taking shelter. The second, Hurricane Irma in 2017, was hard to avoid and I was forced to evacuate; after much debated prediction about which side of Florida it would land on, it hit the west side of Florida. I was taking shelter on the east coast, but the hurricane was so monstrous that I still experienced the effects from the right-front side of the storm, where the strongest winds are. As a hurricane veteran, I've picked up a thing or two on how to prepare for and deal with the aftermath of a hurricane, particularly when it comes to the most important and vulnerable aspects — your finances.

Eliza Relman,"White House Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert gives an update on the federal response to Hurricane Irma. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has reportedly been fired from his White House position by Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton. Bossert, who has advised the president on terrorism, cybersecurity, and natural disaster response, has been a stalwart defender of Trump over the last 15 months. President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has been fired from his White House position, Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs reported on Tuesday. ""The president is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement confirming Bossert's departure. This comes the day after Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton, took office. Jacobs reported that Bolton asked for Bossert's resignation. A former deputy homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush, Bossert has been a stalwart defender of the president's since he joined the administration during the presidential transition. He has served as the president's top adviser on terrorist threats, cybersecurity issues, and natural disasters. Bossert has been criticized for defending the president's controversial comments about issues ranging from white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia last summer to Russian interference in the 2016 election. On Monday, Bossert asserted that ""no voter in this country was influenced"" by Russian bots during the election. ""I honestly do believe that there is a large degree of misunderstanding in the reporting and there's a whole lot of attempted politicking going on meant to try to undermine the legitimacy of the election,"" he told NBC News.","President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, has reportedly been fired from his White House position by Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton.

Ashley Collman,"Technology is changing the way that emergency responders conduct search-and-rescue operations after hurricanes. When Hurricane Michael ravaged the Florida Panhandle, Amber Gee turned to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration maps to see the damage inflicted on her grandmother's property in Youngstown, Florida. What she found was remarkable: a call for ""HELP"" written on the lawn in downed tree branches. Gee alerted rescuers, who found her uncle, aunt, and a family friend hunkering down at the property last Sunday, and brought them to safety. Mike Aslaksen heads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. Courtesy of Mike Aslaksen It was a feel-good story for Mike Aslaksen, who leads the remote sensing division of the NOAA's National Geodetic Survey. ""I'm happy that there was a happy ending to this,"" he told Business Insider on Tuesday. ""It again really shows some of the multi-use of this data."" The images Gee found came from NOAA researchers taking photos from survey planes that flew over the damaged areas once the hurricane had passed through. The images were then compiled into an interactive map that anyone can search and explore. Aslaksen remembers a similar story coming out of Hurricane Katrina, and is hopeful that the press surrounding Gee's story will lead to others using the tool in future natural disasters. A bird's eye view This technology is hardly new. Aslasksen says NOAA has been taking aerial photos after natural disasters since the 1930s. Typically, the agency sends a single surveying plane up after hurricanes to see what kind of damage the storm has done to the shorelines that might impact nautical travel. FEMA also gives Aslaksen's team special missions to collect images of the destruction inland. Aslaksen shared this image showing the routes the survey plane took after Hurricane Michael. The lines covered the shoreline and a large area north of Panama City, with one line stretching up into Georgia: This maps shows the routes that the NOAA plane took after Hurricane Michael to take pictures of the destruction. NOAA The images taken from the plane are especially helpful at the beginning of the recovery effort, when search-and-rescue teams are reliant on these pictures to see which routes they can take to reach hard-hit areas or whether they need to be helicoptered in. Aslasken said he heard Florida officials used the Hurricane Michael images to determine the best places for helicopters to land in the devastated town of Mexico Beach in order to deliver much-needed food and water. Read more: 25 photos show Hurricane Michael's destruction from the sky A new era of disaster imagery And it's not only hurricanes they're surveying from the sky. The team, which usually includes two pilots and a sensor operator, have also been sent to survey the damage after tornadoes, major floods, earthquakes, nor'easters, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and even man-made disasters like the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. It was September 11th that proved a turning point for the division. Back then, they used film to take their pictures, which meant that it could take up to a week to process the data into a digital format. ""When we interacted with the emergency response community, they really said we need it in 24 hours or we can't use it all,"" Aslaksen said. So his team focused their energies on digitizing their whole process to meet that 24-hour goal. A NOAA aerial picture shows some of the damage done after the Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964. NOAA They met that goal and then some. In regards to Michael, the team flew their first mission Thursday morning and had their first sets of maps out by 8:30 p.m., just four hours after landing. ""Comparatively, if we had to do that from the high-end work stations that we used to carry, that could be eight to 12 hours,"" he said. Aslaksen credits the quick turnaround to their camera, which does a lot of the processing while they are still in the air, and the cloud system that they upload their photos to, which can upload between 1,500 to 3,000 images in just a matter of hours. ""Our biggest challenge in a lot of cases is just having a good internet connection to upload the data,"" he said. Record-breaking events A view of some of the devastation after Hurricane Irma on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. NOAA After years of responding to natural disasters, Aslaksen said four stuck out in particular: Hurricane Katrina, the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham tornado, the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma, and Michael. Aslaksen said it left him awestruck to see before images of the Virgin Islands, totally green, turned to brown after Irma completely stripped the vegetation. ""This really shows you how the impact of these storms can be. When you're told to leave, you need to leave,"" he said. Aslaksen said the records show the events they've surveyed in the last year or two have been more severe. ""We're flying a lot more than we used to,"" he said.","One of the feel-good stories to come out of Hurricane Michael was the woman who spotted her relatives' call for help thanks to interactive maps from NOAA.

Officials say all roads in and out are now impassable and have warned evacuated residents to stay away. Reports describe the city, which has a population of about 120,000, as an island within the state. About 400 people there have been rescued from flood waters, and most of the city remains without power. The National Weather Service has warned of at least two further days of possible flash flooding in the area before conditions are forecast to improve. ""Do not come here,"" New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White said. ""Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington...We want you home, but you can't come yet."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some businesses, including the famously resilient Waffle House chain, have remained open in the 'marooned' city Two of the first known fatalities - that of a mother and her seven-month son - were reported in the city on Friday morning. The area is usually best known as a filming location for US dramas One Tree Hill and Dawson's Creek. US basketball legend Michael Jordan - who is fundraising to help residents affected by the storm - also grew up in the city. Many roads inside Wilmington are still passable for residents who defied evacuation orders to ride the storm out. But a city-wide curfew has been extended after five people were arrested on suspicion of looting from a store in the city on Saturday. What is the latest on the storm? At least 17 people are now reported to have died in storm-related incidents in North and South Carolina since Florence made landfall as a category one hurricane on Thursday. It has now weakened into a tropical depression with winds of 35mph (55km/h), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Media caption Gusts &amp; floods: the impact of the storm Some parts of the Carolinas have seen up to 40in (100cm) of rain since Thursday - and officials have warned river levels are yet to peak in places. ""The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Sunday. ""Wherever you live in North Carolina, be alert for sudden flooding."" The governor also warned of the potential danger of landslides once the weather system reached more mountainous areas. The US coast guard and volunteer boats have been helping people left stricken by rising flood waters across the states. Officials in North Carolina have said about 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters there, and about 15,000 people still in emergency shelters. US President Donald Trump has declared a disaster in several North Carolina counties - a move that frees up federal funding for recovery efforts. He has praised federal and local law enforcement response to the storm on Twitter several times and the White House has indicated he may visit the affected area in coming days. Power companies are working to restore power to the almost 650,000 homes and businesses that are still without electricity. The centre of the storm is still over North Carolina but is expected to accelerate north on Sunday night local time before turning to head toward New England on Tuesday. What do we know of the victims? Eleven deaths were reported in North Carolina, and at least six have been reported in South Carolina. A mother and her seven-month child who died when a tree fell on their house in Wilmington were the first known deaths reported. Among the other fatalities were two men in their 70s who died in Lenoir County - one had been connecting extension cords and another was blown by high winds when checking on his dogs. Four road deaths in South Carolina have been blamed on the storm, and two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Caralynn Lippo,"People living in Lake Worth, Florida nearly had a Night of the Living Dead situation on their hands this weekend — or so they briefly thought. According to The Guardian, the city's residents received automated messages about a ""power outage and zombie alert."" The alert was sent out shortly before 2:00 a.m. local time on May 20. ""Power outage and zombie alert for residents of Lake Worth and Terminus. There are now far less than seven thousand three hundred and eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity. Restoration time uncertain,"" the bizarre message read. Obviously, the alert was fake — the zombie apocalypse isn't nigh just yet. (And FWIW, ""Terminus"" is the name of a city in the zombie drama The Walking Dead.) City spokesman Ben Kerr posted a message on Lake Worth Live, the community's Facebook page, later that day apologizing for the false alarm. ""7,880 customers were effected [sic], power was restored within 27 minutes. We are looking into the reports that the system mentioned zombies, I want to reiterate that Lake Worth does not have any zombie activity currently and apologize for the system message,"" Kerr wrote. Kerr told Gizmodo this has actually been a reoccurring issue in Lake Worth. The first ime the power outage alert had been altered to include the zombie reference was during Hurricane Irma back in August 2017. At that time, they were able to fix the message before the public noticed. Kerr also clarified that, though the pre-programmed alerts system was obviously hacked, the systems controlling the city's power haven't been. ""The actual power systems were not in any way compromised. This is a separate messaging system that at some point has been compromised,"" he said. ""They just added a zombie fantasy.""

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to more than a 45-year low last week, suggesting the economy remains strong despite signs of a slowdown in the first quarter. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended March 24, the lowest level since January 1973, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 230,000 in the latest week. The government released 2018 seasonal factors with the report and published revisions to the seasonal factors and data going back to 2013. The revisions did not change the theme of tightening labor market conditions. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market, for 158 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. The Labor Department said claims for Maine, Hawaii and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 224,500 last week. Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will start boosting wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to support consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 35,000 to 1.87 million in the week ended March 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 12,750 to 1.86 million. The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which March’s unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims declined 46,000 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting little change in the jobless rate this month.

Francine McKenna,"There was no consensus on how to solve chronic problems at the bankrupt Puerto Rico power company brought to the brink by hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017 but plenty of proposals. The discussion ranged from a full takeover by the U.S. Department of Energy, to a privatization strategy that is in process, to the complete replacement of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority by an open competitive energy market. James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors LLC in Chicago, testified that the Department of Energy “has the expertise, resources and mission to be a substitute oversight to supervise PREPA, navigate the PROMESA process as the Oversight Board for PREPA, and assist in evaluating appropriate rates, selection of appropriate governance and management, and, if appropriate, implementation of the privatization process.” The suggestion of a complete federal takeover was dramatic, given Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat from New York, mentioned that the hearing was being held on the 120th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico. Bruce Walker, Assistant Secretary, Office of Electricity, Department of Energy testified there is no way a total takeover of PREPA by DOE is practical without support of Puerto Rican people. Velazquez asked Walker to explicitly state the DOE position on a full takeover, or federalization, of PREPA. Walker said federalization is not what DOE wants to do. There is at least one thing, in particular, that can be done short of federalization to improve PREPA effectiveness—remove the authority of the governor to appoint the board and CEO to reduce the politicization of the agency, Walker said. See also: Congress tees up efforts to wrench control of bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority from island’s government Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, a Republican who represents the 3.4 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico in Congress and is a member of the committee, said privatization was the only solution for PREPA’s problems. Walker told the committee that the Southern States Energy Board, in association with the DOE, is currently working towards a policy and regulatory framework for privatization. On June 20, 2018 Democratic Governor Ricardo Rosselló signed legislation into law that provides the legal framework for privatization. But that will take three to five years, said Walker. Rep. Don Young, a Republican form Alaska, told Walker to get ready to do privatization of PREPA sooner. “Privatization is going to happen,” said Young. Eduardo Bhatia, the minority leader of the Senate of Puerto Rico, strongly advocated scrapping PREPA completely and opening the energy market in Puerto Rico to alternative energy sources and renewables such as solar power. He supports a full dismantling of the government-run agency, even a privatized version, as a result of his own investigation of corruption and mismanagement at PREPA that he says found billions of waste and corruption over the last ten years.",There was no consensus on how to solve chronic problems at the bankrupt Puerto Rico power company brought to the brink by hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017 but plenty of proposals.,2018-07-25T20:59:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",Capitol Report: Congressional hearing debates various proposals to fix bankrupt Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congressional-hearing-debates-various-proposals-to-fix-bankrupt-puerto-rico-electric-power-authority-2018-07-25,http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV636_puerto_ZG_20171004142415.jpg,,Marketwatch.com,Irma,1

More than 2.45 million people were evacuated in advance as authorities issued a red alert, the highest warning level. 'Extraordinarily powerful' wind Eyewitness: Matt Bossons, American journalist, Shenzhen The wind is extraordinarily powerful and the rain has rendered visibility very, very limited at this point. There's still a lot of waves coming in off the ocean and there's a lot of storm surge coming up onto the beach and on to the hotel grounds. We were supposed to leave this morning and we're still here as of now because the major roadways in the province are all closed and the trains which connect Shenzhen to most other parts of the country and province have all stopped, so our plans to try and get out of here have been delayed for probably at least another 24 hours or so. Authorities also issued their maximum alert in Hong Kong, warning residents to stay indoors and away from windows to avoid flying debris. Despite avoiding a direct hit, winds there reportedly reached more than 110mph. As the storm passed, it made skyscrapers sway, flooded streets and broke windows. Officials put the number of injured at more than 200, as water levels surged by almost 3.5m (12ft) in places. Most shops and public services were shut, and about 900 flights were cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport. A resident living in a high-rise in the city told Reuters news agency she could feel her building swaying in the storm. ""It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours,"" Elaine Wong said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida Rescuers are picking their way through devastated areas of north-west Florida amid fears the death toll from Hurricane Michael will rise. At least 17 deaths have been confirmed so far in a swath of destruction stretching up to Virginia. Rescuers have still to search the worst-affected areas of Florida's flattened Mexico Beach. The hurricane, one of the most powerful in US history, struck on Wednesday with 155mph (250km/h) winds. What is the latest death toll? So far at least eight people are confirmed dead in Florida, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia. Rescuers using heavy machinery and trained dogs found the body of a man, the latest reported fatality, while searching through rubble on Friday in Mexico Beach. But Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the number of deaths was expected to rise as teams combed through badly hit areas in Mexico Beach, Port St Joe and Panama City. Residents of Mexico Beach had been under a mandatory evacuation order, but it is believed at least 285 people among a population of 1,000 had stayed behind to ride out the storm. Florida senator Marco Rubio said: ""You hope that somehow at the last minute a bunch of people got up and left or went somewhere else."" Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for across the area, but this may simply reflect an inability to communicate with relatives, with mobile phone coverage out in many areas. What have officials and residents said? Florida Governor Rick Scott said as he visited Mexico Beach on Friday: ""It's like a bomb went off. It's like a war zone."" He said more than 1,700 rescue workers had been deployed. Mexico Beach mayor Al Cathey said: ""When you walk down and see this... your emotions run away. This is just a small unique coastal community."" Mr Long said: ""Very few people live to tell what it's like to experience storm surge, and unfortunately in this country we seem to not learn the lesson."" He added: ""You have to build to a higher standard. If we're going to rebuild, do it right."" Many homes on the affected Florida coastline suffered storm surges of 12-14ft (3.7 to 4.3m). The residents of Mexico Beach, those who stayed and those who evacuated and have now returned, were simply trying to come to terms with the destruction. Tiffany Marie Plushnik, who left and returned to her home in Sandy Creek, told Associated Press: ""I didn't recognise nothing. Everything's gone. I didn't even know our road was our road."" Danny Sinclair, 64, from Mexico Beach, told Reuters: ""I don't think it will ever be the same. People will just pack up and leave."" Are rescue operations working? Thousands of people were still in emergency centres on Friday. Distribution centres have begun to spring up, but many residents remain desperate for basic services. Long lines had formed in some areas for fuel, food and water. Retired army sergeant Lynette Cordeno, told the New York Times in Panama City : ""We are walking around with no internet, no cell service, no way to even ask for help."" Resident Tracey Simmons told the paper: ""We know that people are coming, but where are they?"" There are fears of unrest in poorer areas of affected towns and cities. Military personnel could be seen guarding one store in Panama City. A spokesman for the Tyndall Air Force Base told the 3,600 men and women stationed there not to come back following their mandatory evacuation, with runways and buildings devastated. Hundreds of thousands remain without power in Florida, Georgia and Virginia, and in some parts it could be weeks before it is fully restored. An insurance firm, Karen Clark &amp; Company, estimated Michael caused about $8bn (£6bn) of damage. Michael is now a storm-force post-tropical low and is well out into the Atlantic Ocean, heading towards the Bay of Biscay. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland. Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""

Aria Bendix,"As Hurricane Florence makes it way across the Carolinas, millions of coastal residents have reason to be concerned about the structural integrity of their homes. Already, nearly 300,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and officials are reporting damage to property in Onslow County, North Carolina. When Hurricane Harvey swept Texas last September, it damaged more than 204,000 homes and apartment buildings. Around the same time, Hurricane Irma destroyed a quarter of the homes in the Florida Keys, according to federal officials. While the idea of a hurricane-proof home may sound far-fetched, a housing startup called Arkup has created a residence that can withstand rising sea levels and Category 4 hurricanes. The key lies in its hydraulic while lifting it 40 feet above the ocean floor. Arkup calls the residences ""livable yachts"" due to their buoyant nature, which allows them to bob with the water. After debuting the designs in 2017, the company teamed up with The Advantaged Yacht Charters &amp; Sales, the oldest yacht charter company in Miami, to make the structures available for rent and purchase. In August, The Advantaged announced that it is accepting charter reservations online.","As Hurricane Florence makes it way across the Carolinas, millions of coastal residents have reason to be concerned about the structural integrity of their homes.

"Emily Atkin, Emily Atkin","In this NOAA handout image, NOAA’s GOES-East satellite capture of Hurricane Harvey shows the storm making landfall shortly after 8 p.m. CDT on Aug. 25, 2017, on the mid-Texas coast. This story is republished from the New Republic via Climate Desk. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was already supporting 692 federally declared disasters when hurricane season started last year. Then came the most destructive disaster season in U.S. history, causing $265 billion in damage and forcing more than 1 million Americans from their homes. FEMA was overwhelmed. So the agency has a novel suggestion for Americans as the 2018 disaster season heats up: Don’t rely on us. In a report last week evaluating its response to last year’s disaster, FEMA details “how ill-prepared the agency was to manage a crisis outside the continental United States, like the one in Puerto Rico,” the New York Times reported. “And it urges communities in harm’s way not to count so heavily on FEMA in a future crisis.” “The work of emergency management does not belong just to FEMA,” the agency stated near the end of the report. “It is the responsibility of the whole community, federal, [state, local, tribal, and territorial governments], private sector partners, and private citizens to build collective capacity and prepare for the disasters we will inevitably face.” The sentiment echoes President Donald Trump’s own comments about Puerto Rico last year, following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria....Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Still, it’s probably good advice, because thousands of people who depended on FEMA for help last year are still struggling. They include 83-year-old Rosalea Nall, who lived in a hotel for eight months after her Texas home was flooded during Hurricane Harvey. Last week, she had to move back into her gutted house after FEMA stopped providing housing vouchers for Harvey victims. They also include the more than 1,700 Puerto Rican refugees of Hurricane Maria, currently living in hotels on the mainland, whose housing assistance is set to expire on Monday (and that would have expired on June 30 but for the grace of a federal judge). Meanwhile, approximately 1,000 households in Puerto Rico remain without electricity. FEMA acknowledged many of its failures in last week’s report—notably that it emptied emergency supplies from a Puerto Rico warehouse just days before Maria hit. (The supplies were sent to the U.S. Virgin Islands, then reeling from Hurricane Irma.) As USA Today put it, the agency admitted its planning “was incomplete, did not adequately account for the possibility of multiple major disasters in a short amount of time, and underestimated the impact of ‘insufficiently maintained infrastructure’ in Puerto Rico.” Extreme weather is getting more extreme, and until FEMA recognizes and acts on that reality, it will find itself overwhelmed indefinitely. But FEMA also argued that an effective response was near impossible given its resources. “FEMA entered the hurricane season with a [workforce] less than its target, resulting in staffing shortages across the incidents,” the report read. The agency has approximately 10,000 employees, but last year’s hurricanes and wildfires “collectively affected more than 47 million people—nearly 15 percent of the Nation’s population.” Nearly 5 million households registered for FEMA assistance in 2017—more than the previous 10 years combined, and more than all who registered for assistance from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, and Superstorm Sandy, combined. The wildfires in California were their own behemoth, requiring more federal-response contracts than Hurricanes Harvey and Irma combined. FEMA’s response to Hurricane Maria was also “the longest sustained air mission of food and water delivery in FEMA history,” according to the report. Hurricane Irma was “one of the largest sheltering missions in U.S. history,” with 6.8 million people under evacuation order. Eighty percent of the households impacted by Hurricane Harvey did not have flood insurance, either, contributing to FEMA’s high costs. FEMA thus was only able to pay for less than 10 percent of the destruction. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria caused a combined $265 billion in damages, according to the report. Yet as of April 30, FEMA had only obligated $21.2 billion toward those damages. The agency offered several recommendations for improving FEMA’s capability for this year’s disaster season, which is already underway. It suggested, for example, “enhancements to the planning process” when collaborating with state and local governments before disasters. FEMA essentially echoed the message from its planning report in February: “The most important lesson from the challenging disasters of 2017 is that success is best delivered through a system that is Federally supported, state managed, and locally executed.” FEMA is certainly correct that disasters must be managed at all levels, but the most important lesson of the 2017 disaster season is that weather disasters are becoming more frequent and more damaging. The government’s failure to grapple with that reality contributed to FEMA’s poor response. For example, the 1988 Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act —the law that gave FEMA its authority to coordinate disaster-relief efforts—ensured that the agency could only rebuild Puerto Rico’s weak electricity system after it was wiped out by Maria; it was not allowed to spend money on rebuilding a more resilient electricity system. FEMA could have suggested a change in that law in its after-action report. And yet, just as the agency failed to mention climate change in its March report, it failed to do so in last week’s report. Extreme weather is getting more extreme, and until FEMA recognizes and acts on that reality, it will find itself overwhelmed indefinitely.",This story is republished from the New Republic via Climate Desk.,2018-07-19T16:21:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",FEMA Isn’t Ready for Hurricane Season to Start,https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-lessons-fema-refuses-to-learn-from-2017.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/b4a110fc-6aea-42cf-b0e2-53802f6201fa.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,Irma,1
JASON FARAGO,"CRITIC’s NOTEBOOK Newly discovered photographs by the Nobel-winning novelist reveal a South African adolescence shaped by art and apartheid. A tiekiedraai, or dance party, on New Year’s Eve. Mr. Coetzee remembers: “I had a flash attachment on the Wega but could never get the flash to synchronize with the shutter.” Credit J.M. Coetzee In 2014, years after he moved from South Africa to Australia, the novelist J.M. Coetzee finally sold his own apartment in Cape Town. Soon after a researcher went through a cardboard box left behind in the vacated flat — and inside, to his astonishment, he discovered a welter of remarkable unpublished materials by the taciturn Nobel laureate. But they were not manuscripts. They were photographs: sheafs of yellowing prints that depicted “scenes from provincial life,” as his three volumes of autobiography are subtitled, as well as undeveloped negatives. Before he turned to literature, it turns out, Mr. Coetzee was a committed teenage photographer — and his black-and-white impressions of his family, his school and daily life on his uncle’s farm are on view for the first time, in an exhibition at the Irma Stern Museum in Cape Town. Mr. Coetzee had never showed the photographs to anyone; he was suspicious, when the exhibition was proposed, whether a writer’s early experiments with the camera had any importance at all. But the images, shot in 1955 and 1956, when the author was 15 and 16 years old, offer a crucial vista onto the formation of an author as restrained in his personal disclosures as in his prose. More than that, they give a new depth to his fiction, which owes as much to the arts of the lens as of the page. A rugby match at St. Joseph's Marist College, in Cape Town. Credit J.M. Coetzee The exhibition, which closes this weekend, was organized by the curator Farzanah Badsha and Hermann Wittenberg, the scholar who first found the images. Mr. Wittenberg provided me with digital reproductions of Mr. Coetzee’s early snaps, which had to suffice for me — I wasn’t able to make it to Cape Town for the show (and the beach). Nearly two dozen of the photographs in the exhibition are vintage prints; another 58 are newly printed from negatives abraded and speckled by time. Mr. Coetzee was born in Cape Town in 1940. His family was not wealthy, and it would have been a considerable expense for young John to acquire his 35-millimeter Wega — a less expensive Italian clone of the lightweight Leica camera used by Henri Cartier-Bresson and other photographers he admired in Life magazine. Vera Coetzee, the author’s mother, stands in front of the family’s house in Plumstead, a Cape Town suburb. Credit J.M. Coetzee Soon he set up a darkroom in his family home in the suburbs of Cape Town. His mother, Vera, was a schoolteacher; John loved her deeply, and photographed her outside their tidy house, asleep on a sofa or reading with his younger brother, David. John felt more alienated from his father, Zacharias (known as Jack or Zac), as the author elaborated in “ Summertime ” (2009), the third and most fictionalized of his autobiographical books. Jack appears in just one photograph, in which his son has captured him at his meekest. Jack’s shoulders are slumped forward, his arms crossed, while John’s maternal aunt Annie reproves him with an extended finger. Mr. Coetzee’s father, Zacharias, and aunt, Annie. The author’s relationship with his father forms a core component of “Summertime.” Credit J.M. Coetzee Though the Coetzees were Afrikaners, they spoke English at home. Mr. Coetzee also attended an English-language school, St. Joseph’s Marist College. In “ Boyhood ” (1997), the author describes the school as “a shrunken little world, a more or less benign prison in which he might as well be weaving baskets as going through the classroom routine.” During one lesson, Mr. Coetzee sneaked a photograph of his Afrikaans teacher, Father Alexis, “an intelligent man who finds teaching beneath him.” A class at St. Joseph's Marist College, taught by a priest named Brother Alexis. According to Mr. Coetzee, “So tedious did he find the role of teacher that Brother Alexis would doze off in class. But when aroused he had a fearsome hand with the cane.” Credit J.M. Coetzee The school did offer the relief of sport, especially cricket, with which the teenage John was obsessed. In “ Diary of a Bad Year ” (2007), Mr. Coetzee confesses (in the voice of an alter ego, the novelist Señor C) that “in childhood, almost as soon as I learned to throw a ball, cricket took a grip on me, not just as a game but as a ritual.... But one question baffled me from the beginning: how a creature of the kind I seemed to be — reserved, quiet, solitary — could ever become good at a game in which quite another character type seemed to excel: matter-of-fact, unreflective, pugnacious.” A student at St. Joseph's Marist College playing cricket. “He knows no one who is consumed with cricket as he is,” Mr. Coetzee writes of himself in “Boyhood.” Credit J.M. Coetzee If the writer-to-be found Cape Town stultifying, he was enraptured by the Karoo, the arid interior region of South Africa where his uncle had a farm, called Voëlfontein (or “Bird Fountain,” in Afrikaans). The pockmarked landscape of the Karoo played a central role in the young writer’s perceptions of nature, family and colonization. In “Boyhood” Mr. Coetzee writes: “He knows Voëlfontein best in summer, when it lies flattened under an even, blinding light that pours down from the sky.” It’s an impression compounded in one of his photographs, whose top half is occupied by an unbroken vault of cloud. Voëlfontein, Mr. Coetzee’s uncle’s farm, in the arid central region of South Africa known as the Karoo. Credit J.M. Coetzee Mr. Coetzee’s photographs of Voëlfontein, even at this young age, exhibit the ambivalent stance toward the South African countryside that would animate his later fiction — one trapped between love for its expanses and shame at its historical inheritance. This parched landscape was where he would set two early novels: “ In the Heart of the Country ” (1977), his prismatic portrait of a murderous rural housewife, and “ Life &amp; Times of Michael K ” (1983), his minimal, Kafkaesque fable of the apartheid state. The most remarkable images in this juvenile archive depict two farmhands at Voëlfontein, named Ros and Freek, whom Mr. Coetzee describes in “Boyhood” with rapt admiration. The laborers are “ coloured ” — an apartheid-era designation for people of mixed African, European and Asian background — and as a child he struggles with the written and unwritten rules that keep them apart. One day in 1955 or 1956 the Coetzees traveled to the beach with Ros and Freek, who had never seen the sea before. Mr. Coetzee does not mention this trip in “Boyhood,” but his numerous shots of the farmhands, shot in a powerful low contrast that recalls the willfully spare new world of his recent “ The Childhood of Jesus ” (2013), reflect the momentousness of the day for the men and the boy alike. Ros and Freek, workers on the farm that belonged to Mr. Coetzee’s uncle, visit the beach at Strandfontein, a town about 200 miles north of Cape Town. Credit J.M. Coetzee In one of his rare interviews, when asked about the literary influences on “In the Heart of the Country,” Mr. Coetzee responded: “There is, I think, a more fundamental influence: film and/or photography.” And beyond the underlying influence of the camera, photographs have played a part in many of his novels: from his debut, “Dusklands” (1974), narrated in part by an American government researcher who carries photographs of war atrocities in Vietnam, to “ Disgrace ” (1999), his brutal dissection of post-apartheid South Africa, in which a shamed English professor encounters a belittling portrait of himself in the student newspaper. Later, in “ Slow Man ” (2005), Mr. Coetzee made his main character a photographer — one disenchanted to learn that digital images “could be sucked into a machine and emerge from it doctored, untrue.” A police car pulls up alongside two black pedestrians in the Cape Town suburb of Newlands. The South African government officially adopted the system of apartheid in 1948, seven to eight years before Mr. Coetzee took this photograph. Credit J.M. Coetzee In “Boyhood” and the subsequent autobiographies, Mr. Coetzee refers to himself only by the pronoun he. Even his decision to write under the name J.M. Coetzee — eliding the name “John,” and using a middle initial that he allowed to be misidentified for decades (it stands for Maxwell, not Michael) — drew a curtain around himself. Yet in his photographic self-portraits, now more than 60 years old, a similar authorial detachment is mixed with frankness, sincerity and even pride. We see the adolescent John in a wool vest and open-necked shirt, cheeks ruddy, eyes soulful and sad. He leans to one side and appears somewhat frail, yet he stares forth with an assurance beyond his years. The teenage J.M. Coetzee in a self-portrait. Credit J.M. Coetzee In another he poses as a moody teenager, gripped by a melancholy that can lead to genius or misfortune. The room is dark, and the young Coetzee lights his face from below. He gazes upward, expectant. Soon he will put down the camera; it will be two decades before he publishes a book. Every novel he will write will be a self-portrait. Credit J.M. Coetzee “J. M.

Xeni Jardin,"It's not your imagination. The big cable news networks like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox pay way more attention to hurricanes and extreme weather on the east coast than they do to major firestorms in California, like the recent Camp and Woolsey fires. But why? More than a thousand people are still missing from those firestorms, which struck over the last two weeks and received scant attention, compared with archival records of the time devoted to big weather events closer to New York and Washington, DC. The Camp Fire is the deadliest fire in California state history. On Fox News and MSNBC, the peak density of coverage through Sunday has never matched the lowest density of coverage on those networks in the first two weeks after the formation of Hurricane Irma in 2017, writes Philip Bump at the Washington Post, in a great piece that tracks how coverage of wildfires and hurricanes compares on cable news -- and why discrepancies exist: In the wake of the Camp Fire in Northern California, which has killed at least 76 people, with hundreds missing, there has been a common criticism on social media that the wildfire and wildfires in general receive much less coverage than hurricanes on cable news. Analysis of closed-captioning data collected by the Internet Archive makes clear that this perception is accurate. Looking at four hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017 and Michael this year we pulled data on the density of hurricane coverage on every day following the formation of the storms. Of the four, Maria got the least coverage in the days after formation, with Irma receiving the highest density of coverage on cable news networks. East Coast bias is only part of why this happens.

Adam Rogers,"Michael introduced itself to North America with 155-mile-per-hour gusts of wind and a barometric pressure of 919 millibars, the third-strongest hurricane to ever make continental US landfall. It was a monster, and it stayed a monster as it rolled through Georgia and then on toward the Carolinas. And monsters are made, not born. The most striking thing about Michael is that it was barely a tropical storm a couple of days ago, and all of a sudden it almost touched cat-5 intensity, says Karthik Balaguru, an oceanographer who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Typically hurricanes ramp up more slowly (if at all), and landfall reduces their intensity. The thing with Michael is, it just kept on intensifying, Balaguru says. Thats calledperhaps as youd expectrapid intensification, and it used to be a rare phenomenon among Atlantic hurricanes. Thats good, because rapidly intensifying hurricanes also tend to be the ones that are the most dangerous, the deadliest and the most expensive. Unfortunately, rapidly intensifying hurricanes seem to be a rarity no longer. Of the record-breaking hurricane season of 201717 named storms, 6 major hurricanesall four category-4 or 5 storms underwent rapid intensification. Thats Harvey, which drowned Houston, Irma, Jose, and Maria, which was so devastating to Puerto Rico. Now, to be fair, most Atlantic cat-4 and cat-5 storms go through rapid intensification; the dangerous ones do it near the coastline, just before landfall. More intense hurricanes are one of the central predictions scientists have made about Earths changing climate. Human beings pump more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the air, and the air changes. The planets overall temperature goes up, and that means, in part, more energy in the top of the oceans. Thats a hurricanes engine. Advances like satellites and radar have made high accuracy possible in predicting a hurricanes eventual track, the path it takes across ocean and land. Intensity, though, is another story. Its hardas the hurricane researcher Kerry Emanuel wrote last year, a good intensity prediction would require better numerical models, better understanding of boundary layers between air and water, and a better model of how the upper ocean interacts with storms. Scientists dont have any of those. Forecasting rapid intensification is even harder. And again, perhaps as one might expect, a warmer climate makes rapid intensification more likely. Emanuels group calculated from observations of past storms that a hurricane with wind speeds that grew 68 miles per hour in the day before making landfall should only happen once in a century under the conditions of an unchanged climatebasically a hundred-year storm. And the vulnerable cities were just about where youd expect, too: Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, Miami. But, the researchers then calculated, in the post climate-change climate of our Burning World, those storms could happen once every five years. And the new hundred-year storm? Pre-landfall intensifications of 114 mph, so massive as to be essentially nonexistent in the late twentieth-century climate, Emanuel writes. People will have never seen anything that bad. Balagurus group found similarly grim news. Their calculations, based again on observed rapid intensification, say that climate change and variations in Atlantic conditions could drive up the magnitude of that intensification. Point is, climate change means more rapid intensification like what Michael did, and worse. How did Michael pull it off? If I had to guess, Id say it experienced perfect conditions for a hurricanea lot of heat available in the ocean and favorable atmospheric conditions, Balaguru says. Wind shear, the changes in magnitude and direction of winds from the oceans surface all the way up to the top of the troposphereabout six miles upmust have also subsided. High enough wind shear can disrupt convection at the storms center, weakening it overall. That didnt happen here. The result: yet another perfect storm in yet another season of perfect storms, crashing into a heavily populated coastline full of environmental disasters waiting to happen. As of Thursday, Michael has ramped back down. Its merely a powerful tropical storm now. And its tracking right over the towns where Hurricane Florence made landfall last month.

Ivan Tolchinsky,"Perhaps I’m biased due to my passion and business, but to me, 2017 was the year drones became mainstream. Initially a military innovation used for covert missile strikes and aerial reconnaissance — drones have evolved to become a novelty toy, readily available in any main street store. And as with so many other technologies, entry into the consumer market has led to abuse: pranksters spying on neighbors, criminals smuggling drugs and terrorists converting drones into homemade missiles. But there’s great news, too. Commercial drones have proven their worth, saving lives during hurricanes Irma and Harvey, reducing labor costs through infrastructure inspections and improving border security. I’m optimistic about what drones have to offer the world. With an expected total addressable value of $127 billion by 2020 — in markets such as security, infrastructure inspection, and agriculture – here are four reasons I believe 2018 will be the defining year for the commercial UAV industry, far surpassing anything we saw in 2017. 1. The technology will evolve Drone technologies will develop to enable fully autonomous operations and increased Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) missions. What does this mean practically? Today, someone flying a drone must be able to see that drone in the air — the drone may not leave their line of sight. However, BVLOS means the operator can be in one place, while the drone is doing its job in another, making it significantly easier to support security and surveillance systems. Today all drones work on a “node-to-node” basis — one controller is connected to one drone — but this will also change in 2018. The introduction of MESH networks will allow drones to simultaneously connect to the same control center and also interconnect with each other, enabling individual drones to “talk,” exchange data and streamline activity. Right now, drones are mostly “flying cameras” that collect data. The drone returns from its data collecting mission, and then an operator analyzes the footage. In 2018, we’ll see stronger processing power that will allow drones to become smart sensors, integrating computer vision and neural network technologies to analyze data on the surroundings and mission in real time, autonomously, without the need for human direction. This adds up to drones independently making decisions and taking care of business. All this will culminate in the establishment of swarm technology. Like insects in a colony, factories will comprise workforces of drones, performing their tasks and working together. Each of these changes are exciting, but when you put it all together, drones will be a game-changer for multiple fields in 2018. 2. We’ll see mass adoption by security and emergency response Based on what I’ve observed in the market over the past couple of years, law enforcement, security, and first response will be the first to implement drones in a significant way. Drones proved their worth last year, delivering emergency relief supplies in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. The newest commercial drones will offer longer flight times, heavier payloads and secure integrated systems, allowing security and emergency response professionals to use drones more effectively — saving money, time, and even lives. Crucially, these markets are also the most willing to pay for drone tech, as they’re already paying for tools that perform the same “jobs” in an inefficient manner — either very expensive helicopters, or consumer drones with limited capabilities. Eventually, commercial-grade drones will be among the everyday tools used by fire departments, police forces, border security, and emergency response teams. Security organizations, in particular, will be able to fully integrate drones into their more comprehensive closed security systems, which might include smart fences, security cameras and sensors. And full integration allows each of these elements to be controlled from the same central command center. These early adopters will lead by example — other industries will see the benefits of drone-based solutions, eventually making commercial drone technologies ubiquitous across industries. And from what we’ve been seeing, this will be happening fast. 3. Regulation will increase We’ve been conditioned to think regulation limits growth. But with drones, it’s actually a good thing. As the technology progresses, producing drones with greater capabilities and increased BVLOS operations (drone operation from a remote location), regulation will advance in favor of professional drones. These regulations will also address genuine concerns over privacy, safety and national security. We’ve already started to see this shift following reports of cartels using drones to smuggle drugs and ISIS weaponizing drones against allied troops. Unusually for the commercial sector, developers will be in favor of stricter regulations on consumer drones, as they will create greater opportunities for professional drone use. In fact, this past summer, the US government began talks with drone developers to discuss the expansion of commercial drone operations. Additionally, the U.K. government introduced tougher regulations to crackdown on dangerous flying and criminal drone use. As such, I believe we’ll see increased regulation on the consumer drone market in 2018, limiting the opportunities for criminals to strap bombs and other weapons or contraband onto a drone purchased at their local Radio Shack, and helping the commercial market spread its wings (pun intended!). 4. The drone business model will shift We all know how Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) changed the way we consume and use applications and other types of software. This new business model, enabled due to innovation in cloud computing and hosting, totally changed the business model of software companies. Well, in 2018 we’ll see the introduction of DaaS — Drones-as-a-Service. As technology advances to make drones more user-friendly and affordable, organizations will shift their business strategies accordingly. As the technology evolves towards fully autonomous UAV solutions, we will remove the need for human operators, and enable a business model that is based on Drones-as-a-Service. Specific industries that don’t want to create a dedicated “drone division” will begin leasing drones, which will then be integrated into their own closed systems, according to the application they need, enabling them to extract the value from the data without having to operate or maintain the drones themselves — that’s the beauty of outsourcing! These new business models will eventually open up the industry to more stakeholders, allowing new players to get in on the game, developing new use cases for autonomous drones. These four factors have the potential to completely transform the commercial drone space. 2018 is the year we’ll see it happen. Capabilities will increase as complex aeronautical technology is simplified into accessible and easily integrated products. Meanwhile, adoption will increase along with the realization that autonomous drone platforms can meet the demands of countless applications across multiple industries. Hold on tight, this year is going to be a heck of a ride.","Perhaps I’m biased due to my passion and business, but to me, 2017 was the year drones became mainstream.

Dyllan Furness,"Last year’s hurricane season was one for the record books. In late August, Hurricane Harvey dropped more than 40 inches of rain on eastern Texas, making it the wettest and one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record. In late September, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, devastating the island and causing the worst electrical blackout in United States history. A few weeks earlier, Hurricane Irma became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic region. Satellite views depicted Irma as shrouding Florida from coast to coast. As if these hurricanes weren’t bad enough, residents in the Caribbean were threatened by another storm nearly 93 million miles away. Just as Hurricane Irma battered the Caribbean in early September, a series of solar flares erupted from the sun and caused emergency radio communications to go offline for hours, according to a new study published in the journal Space Weather. In the paper, the researchers note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) reported an eight-hour loss of high-frequency radio used by ham radio operators and other emergency bands. “Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,” Rob Redmon, a space scientist with NOAA and lead author of the new study, said in a statement. “If I head on over to my amateur radio operator, and they have been transmitting messages for me, whether it be for moving equipment or finding people or just saying I’m okay to somebody else, suddenly I can’t do that on this day, and that would be pretty stressful.” A few days later, on September 10, another large solar flare hit Earth and compromised radio communication for another three hours — around the same time that Caribbean islands like the Bahamas were recovering from and bracing for two consecutive storms. Solar flares are strong eruptions of radiation, carrying electronics, ions, and atoms from the sun into space. Though flares occur often, they usually don’t impact our planet. This isn’t the first time a solar flare may have meddled in affairs on Earth. According to a study published in Space Weather two years ago, a solar flare in 1967 nearly sparked World War III, jamming radars at the North American Aerospace Defense Command Post, and leaving U.S. Air Force officers to suspect Soviet interference. Astrophysicists are looking into ways to shield the planet from solar flares, including using a massive magnet. It’s unclear what indirect impact last year’s solar flares had on emergency and relief efforts, but the study may draw more attention to the real risks of these difficult-to-predict events.","Just as Hurricane Irma battered the Caribbean in early September, a series of solar flares erupted from the sun and caused emergency radio communications to go offline for hours.

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a tightening labor market and strengthening economy at the start of the year. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Jan. 27, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 fewer claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 238,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for Maine were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal months after the territories were slammed by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Last week marked the 152nd straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Tightening labor market conditions have raised optimism among Federal Reserve officials that inflation will increase towards the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target this year. The Fed on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and described the labor market as having “continued to strengthen.” U.S. financial markets expect a rate increase in March. The Fed has forecast three rate increases for this year after lifting borrowing costs three times in 2017. Last week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,000 to 234,500, the lowest level since early November. The claims data has no bearing on January’s employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing by 148,000 in December. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 13,000 to 1.95 million in the week ended Jan. 20. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 12,000 to 1.93 million.

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","Puerto Rico's emergency management director Abner Gómez's resignation is effective Saturday Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, appointed by Pentagon to lead military relief efforts, leaves island next week (CNN) Puerto Rico's emergency management director resigned Friday as the island's slow recovery continues nearly two months after Hurricane Maria made landfall. In announcing the resignation of Abner Gómez, effective Saturday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló praised the work of his emergency management chief following the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in early and later September. The governor also announced that Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who was appointed by the Pentagon to lead all military relief efforts, will be reassigned outside the island next week. About 60% of the US territory is still without power as the island's approximately 3.4 million US citizens struggle through the aftermath of the storm. A massive power outage struck the capital of San Juan on Thursday after a major north-south transmission line failed, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA. No reason given for resignation Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, will take over emergency management duties. Rosselló did not give a reason for Gómez's resignation. The emergency management director came under fire after the island's El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported that Gómez took a two-week vacation shortly after Maria made landfall on September 20. Buchanan, a three-star star general and commander of US Army North (5th Army), arrived in Puerto Rico in late September as the military was tasked with improving distribution networks of relief supplies. 'We've moved out of the crisis' ""The cessation of General Buchanan's work does not mean that the military is leaving,"" Rosselló said in a statement. ""His departure marks a positive transition. We have not finished the recovery, but there is progress in the missions that have been carried out."" Buchanan will be replaced by a two-star general, according to the governor. ""From my perspective, we've moved out of the crisis,"" Buchanan told reporters. ""We're moving out of response and most places are moving on towards recovery... FEMA is going to be here for very much the long term and the rebuilding effort, and we in the military generally don't do that."" The changes come as the island's government faces questions about the official death toll of 55 from the massive storm. Government officials acknowledged this week that nearly 500 more people died in Puerto Rico in September than in the same month the previous year. An official with Puerto Rico's forensics institute told reporters that 472 more people died this September than in the same month in 2016 -- up from 2,366 to 2,838. Wanda Llovet, director of the Demographic Register, said there were about 82 deaths a day reported from September 1 through September 19, compared to some 117 per day during the last ten days of the month. ""We are not going to say there could be more or less,"" Pesquera, whose oversees the count, said of hurricane-related fatalities. ""We've quantified the number of deaths."" Pesquera has staunchly defended government efforts to generate an accurate count under extremely trying conditions: most lines of communication were cut and many roads on the island were initially impassable.

Salvador Hernandez,"As Hurricane Irma barreled toward Florida in the early days of September, immigration advocates and public safety officials raised concerns that people living in the US illegally would not seek help or shelter for fear that doing so would expose them to arrest and possible deportation. Hoping to ease those fears, the US Department of Homeland Security stepped in with a public promise : non-criminal immigration enforcement would be temporarily put on hold, while agents with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) focused on Irma rescue and relief efforts. ""In evacuation or response, we are committed to making sure that we can assist local authorities quickly, safely, and efficiently. DHS will not conduct non-criminal immigration enforcement operations in the affected area,"" the department said in a Sept. 6 statement. ""At the request of FEMA, local and state authorities, DHS law enforcement personnel will be in the affected area to conduct search and rescue, air traffic de-confliction and public safety missions. When it comes to rescuing people in the wake of Hurricane Irma, immigration status is not and will not be a factor."" But for four days after the statement was issued, officials with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Florida continued to take undocumented immigrants into custody, changing little in the agency's local day-to-day operations as the state braced for the oncoming Category 4 storm. CBP officials told BuzzFeed News that though priorities shifted to focus on life-saving operations in the days before Irma made landfall, immigration enforcement actions and arrests continued until Sept. 10, four days after DHS issued its statement pledging that such activity had ceased. CBP declined to provide details on how many people were picked up by immigration agents during that period. But court documents show that on Sept. 6 — the same day DHS issued its statement — border patrol agents in Brevard County, Florida, took three men into custody after they were unable to provide identification to local police. The filings also show that the men were later placed on GPS monitoring by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which had already shut down detention operations in preparation for Hurricane Irma. ICE declined to provide numbers on how many people were put on GPS monitoring during the storm. When asked why enforcement operations continued even after DHS declared that such actions would cease, Peter Daniel, acting chief patrol agent of the US Border Patrol's Miami sector, noted that the Sept. 6 statement did not specify when the directive should take effect. “Well, is there a starting date in the document?” Daniel asked BuzzFeed News. “There you go.” CBP's decision to continue enforcement appears to validate some of the fears held by immigrants, particularly those living in the country illegally, about seeking assistance or shelter during natural disasters like the series of deadly hurricanes that hit the southern United States this fall. In the days before Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida on Sept. 10, local authorities began issuing evacuation orders for much of the state, eventually calling for more than 6 million residents to leave their homes. On Sept. 6, the same day that DHS issued its statement regarding enforcement activity during Hurricane Irma, Florida Governor Rick Scott deployed 1,000 members of the National Guard to help prepare for the storm. Schools statewide closed the following day, and by Sept. 9, Scott had warned that Floridians living in or near evacuation zones needed to leave immediately. ""You need to go, right now,"" he said. Still, CBP agents continued immigration enforcement operations until Sept. 10, the same day Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys, forcing agents to hunker down in their offices or homes, officials told BuzzFeed News. Neither DHS, ICE, or CBP responded to BuzzFeed News' requests for information about immigration enforcement activity during Irma. But at least three Mexican nationals were taken into custody by CBP and put under GPS surveillance on Sept. 6, following a minor traffic collision in West Melbourne, Florida. The incident occurred after the West Melbourne Police Department responded to a call about a non-injury car accident. Police officials confirmed to BuzzFeed News that no laws were broken during the incident, but said that the officer who responded to the scene called CBP when three male passengers were unable to provide identification. About 30 minutes after she responded to the scene, the officer told police dispatch that CBP agents were taking the three men into custody, according to call logs of the incident. Capt. Richard Cordeau of the West Melbourne Police Department told BuzzFeed News the men were not required to provide an ID, but said that the department maintains a close relationship with immigration enforcement officials and the officer decided to reach out. ""As a matter of fact, the officer had talked to [the CBP supervisor)]that morning and he said, 'If you need anything give me a call,'"" Cordeau said. John Modlin, chief of CBP's Miami sector, told BuzzFeed News that this type of informal cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration agents is routine, and continued in the days leading up to Hurricane Irma. Specific numbers for how many people were picked up during this period were not immediately available, Mordin said. He added that he did not believe the agency's response to the car accident in West Melbourne contradicted DHS's promise not to conduct non-criminal enforcement during Irma. ""We didn't perform any targeted enforcement or placed checkpoints with people moving out of the way of the storm,"" he said. ""In regards to criminal activity, like in this case, we take the appropriate action."" However, court documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, including an affidavit signed by an ICE deportation officer, make no mention of any criminal charges, or suspected criminal activity, that prompted CBP to take the three male passengers into custody. Instead, the affidavit states that Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Victor Colon picked up the men after ""all three passengers admitted to being citizens of Mexico and illegally present within the United States."" CBP officials also pointed out the arrest of the three men occurred a few hours before DHS issued its statement regarding Hurricane Irma operations. But ICE, which is responsible for most detention and deportation operations, was already operating under the department's emergency guidance by that time. According to court documents, ICE's Enforcement Operations and Removal office in Orlando declined to take the men into custody because it was ""currently operating under an Emergency Operation (EMOP) due to Hurricane Irma and was unable to receive any new detainees."" ICE agents subsequently put the men under GPS monitoring and ordered them to return to the office on Sept. 19, after Hurricane Irma was expected to pass. One of the men, identified in court documents as Jose Carlos Hernandez-Lopez, was later arrested and charged with removing the GPS device. Placing the three men on GPS monitoring, in lieu of detention, was part of the emergency procedures that had been put in place because of the hurricane, according to the affidavit. An ICE spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that agency does not have details on how many GPS monitoring devices while enforcement operations were suspended for Hurricane Irma. At least part of CBP's decision to continue enforcement activities in the lead up to Irma seems to hinge on the definition of ""criminal enforcement,"" which some immigration law experts say has expanded under President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration. Modlin, the Miami sector chief, pointed out that one of the men who was taken into custody on Sept. 6 was found to have been convicted of illegally entering the US twice after previously being deported. That, he said, made the incident a criminal immigration case, even though there was no crime reported at the time the CBP officer was called. ""This is how CBP works,"" said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, an associate professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. ""We have seen a loosening of definition of what constitutes illegal activity and a viable target for what are limited immigration enforcement activities."" Under the Trump administration, Hernández said, the term ""criminal alien"" now applies to virtually anyone suspected of being the US illegally. Asked whether CBP concurred with the Miami sector's interpretation of DHS's statement regarding enforcement activities during Hurricane Irma, national spokesperson Michael Friel said the department's notice was meant to convey a shifting of priorities as the hurricane approached, not delineate a specific timeline or strategy by the agencies. ""There's no light switch that goes on and says, we're going to do enforcement or we're not,"" Friel said. ""The posture is we're going to be focusing on the response in the sense of keeping people out of harms way."" DHS did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News regarding the timing of the order, and whether CBP's operations in Florida complied with the department's stated priorities for immigration enforcement agencies during Hurricane Irma. In the aftermath of the storm, Modlin said, CBP prioritized relief efforts, with agents focused on clearing debris and assisting people affected by the storm. ""None of that included asking people what their immigration status was,"" he told BuzzFeed News. ""All of the resources in the Miami sector were focused on life saving."" But Adonia Simpson, director of the family defense program for Florida's American's for Immigrant Justice, an immigrant advocacy group, said the presence of immigration agents at incidents like minor traffic collisions has raised suspicions of local law enforcement among Florida's immigrant community, prompting concerns that people will not seek help in emergency situations. DHS's promise to suspend enforcement during Hurricane Irma was seen as an attempt to allay those fears, she said. ""Given the panic and fear that surrounded Irma's impending landfall, as well as Florida officials stressing the need to seek safety, we find it shameful that enforcement actions were undertaken on non-criminal immigrants after DHS's public statement to the contrary,"" she told BuzzFeed News. ""Events such as these only compound the fear and lack of trust in the community."" Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Mark Kaufman,"At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. But almost a month later, conditions in the Atlantic are showing signs that the 2018 season might be quieter than forecasters initially thought. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down, and that's very bad news for everyone Specifically, surface water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic are unusually cold. When these waters are cooler, it tends to damper the formation of powerful storms, Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said in an interview. ""This is very unusual,"" said Klotzbach. Back in March, the cooler water temperatures were pretty similar to those a year earlier, in March 2017. But since then, tropical waters have simply failed to warm. Tropical Atlantic sea surface temps (SSTs) (10-20°N, 60-20°W) remain at record cold levels (since 1982) for mid-June. About 0.2°C colder than prior coldest (1985) and nearly 1.7°C cooler than last year at this time. Colder SSTs typically mean quieter Atlantic #hurricane seasons pic.twitter.com/dcexoXkUJn — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) June 15, 2018 ""The water went from normal to the coldest since 1982,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the coldest water temperature at this time over the last 35 years."" This is all the more strange, he said, because globally oceans have warmed. Most of the world's accumulating heat, due to climate change, collects in Earth's absorbent waters. ""To me, it's just fascinating given how much warmer the globe is,"" said Klotzbach. Of course, this is not to say a powerful, potentially destructive storm won't arise and pummel the Caribbean or the coastal U.S. ""It’s not an inactive season when the wind blows 100 mph in your backyard,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University, said in an interview. ""It doesn’t mean you can’t have bad luck."" Hurricane forecasts are never set in stone In late May, just before the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1, NOAA predicted just a 25 percent chance of a ""below normal"" season. A calmer season may look more likely now, but forecasting the weather months in advance is always challenging, and comes with inherent uncertainties. ""The ocean is as unpredictable as the atmosphere but on a longer timescale,"" said Willoughby. NOAA's 2018 Atlantic hurricane forecast as of May 24, 2018. Image: noaa And NOAA took this into account, months ago. The agency noted that although the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean waters, known as the ""main hurricane development"" region, had ""anomalously cool"" waters at the time, there was still considerable uncertainty about what would happen during August and September, the peak of the hurricane season, Jerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, explained over email. When temperatures in the tropical waters remain cooler and don't warm, a few things can suppress hurricane activity, said Klotzbach. For one, hurricanes ""live off warm ocean water,"" he said, so these storms have less fuel when ocean temperatures are colder. Second, colder sea surfaces generally mean more dense air over large swathes of the ocean — and with denser air comes more overall stability. Lastly, colder tropical waters often mean stronger trade winds blowing from the east that can ""tears apart hurricanes,"" said Klotzbach. Hurricanes Katia, Irma, and Jose in September 2017. Image: Noaa If these tropical waters don't warm up soon, conditions will be mostly locked in for a milder storm season. ""There's still some time for it to change,"" said Klotzbach. ""But usually when you get to July things are set."" ""If it's going to change, it's got to change soon,"" he added. Hurricane forecasts are still quite important, despite any inherent uncertainty. ""A forecast — if you have a realistic idea of its credibility — is better than no forecast,"" said Willoughby. These forecasts can help slow-moving ocean tugs decide if they should take other oceanic routes, for instance. But most of all, ""It's good for getting people started thinking about hurricanes,"" said Willoughby. NOAA measures sea surface temperatures in a variety of ways, including ocean gliders. Image: noaa Last season brought three major storms to the United States, causing $265 billion in damages. In addition to cooler tropical waters, NOAA has raised the possibility of a 2018 El Niño event in the Pacific, which often brings stronger opposing winds to the Atlantic. ""That's very well understood,"" said Willoughby. ""It kills hurricanes."" Both hurricane scientists and the public alike will see how things ultimately take shape this season — though many won't find a quieter season too disappointing. ""I have to admit that an inactive season wouldn’t break my heart,"" said Willoughby.","At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. …",2018-06-21T14:26:18Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","This Atlantic hurricane season may be quieter than expected, and no one's complaining",https://mashable.com/2018/06/21/quiet-2018-atlantic-hurricane-season/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PsA7nA6J0cp_tVTXNoUrdiZTFbc=/1200x630/2018%2F06%2F21%2F2f%2Febf7e8d3ba3348abbf3870b11f968047.24991.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Irma,1
Aiden Pink,"The editors of Puerto Rico’s largest newspaper have apologized for publishing an op-ed that blames the island’s problems recovering from last year’s devastating hurricane on “the Jew.” Monday’s column by Wilda Rodriguez in the newspaper El Nuevo Día, titled “What Does ‘The Jew’ Want From The Colony?”, claimed that “Wall Street types” dictate U.S. policy, and that “Congress will do what ‘the Jew’ wants, as the vulgar prototype of true power is called.” “No offense to people of that religion,” she added. She went on to claim that Wall Street and “the Jew” are punishing Puerto Rico in order to get the island to pay its $70 billion debts. The paper has since added a note to the top of the article apologizing to the island’s Jewish community, adding, “We do not promote content that can be interpreted as anti-Semitic.” Rodriguez also issued a semi-apologetic statement. “I’m profoundly sorry that some have interpreted one of my pieces as anti-Semitism,” she wrote. “My career as a writer has been clear, and prejudice and racial and religious hostility have never been a part of it.

"April Glaser, April Glaser","In this Dec. 22 photo, 6-year-old Melanie Oliveras González stands on the porch of her house after Hurricane Maria, in Morovis, Puerto Rico. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. Eight months after hurricanes Maria and Irma, large swaths of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still don’t have reliable internet access and phone service—denying the Americans that live there a crucial life line as the islands continue their recoveries from the storms. Of the more than 4,600 people who according to Harvard researchers have died in Puerto Rico since last summer as a consequence of Maria, one third of them perished because of delays in receiving medical care—often because they couldn’t contact medical providers or access information about where to get help. Puerto Rico’s electric utility has restored service to about 97 percent of island, and cell service has largely returned, too. Still, life is barely back to normal. With electricity blackouts, spotty service, and cell sites still down throughout the island, it’s hard to get back to business and sometimes even communicate, a major problem not only for commerce but for hospitals and emergency service workers, too. That would seem to make an announcement from the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday welcome news. The agency said it plans to grant nearly $900 million over the next 10 years to phone and internet companies operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to help rebuild communications networks there, funds that include an immediate infusion of $64 million for phone and internet carriers. On top of that, the FCC said it would excuse a $65.8 million advance it gave to phone and internet providers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands last October to rebuild their networks. It’s a massive amount of money from the FCC, and notably, it’s way more than the $200 million the FCC gave for similar purposes after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast. But it comes with some drawbacks that aren’t mentioned in the press release—drawbacks that highlight the priorities of the current FCC, which has for months been working to gut a program that helps people in extreme poverty pay for cellphone and internet service, and whose plan for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands may well leave the territories with communications services that most of the people who live there can’t afford. In order to offer up nearly $1 billion, the FCC is drawing from the Universal Service Fund, a pot used to help subsidize phone service with a $9.25-a-month discount for Americans who are 135 percent below the poverty line. The Universal Service Fund is also used to connect phone service to schools and libraries, as well as rural areas where service is especially costly. Telecommunications companies that operate in the U.S. are required to pay into this fund, although they often pass on that cost to their subscribers. At the same time the FCC is trying to use a large chunk of the Universal Service Fund to help telecom providers pay for rebuilding their networks, the agency is simultaneously making significant cuts to the fund, particularly the portion intended to help poor people pay for basic phone and internet service. That part of the Universal Service Fund is called the Lifeline program, and nearly 20 percent of Puerto Rico’s population relies on it to help pay for phone and broadband service, according to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn (one of the five-person body’s two Democratic commissioners), who issued a statement following announcement of the $900 million funding effort. At the same time the FCC is trying to use a large chunk of the Universal Service Fund to help telecom providers pay for rebuilding their networks, the agency is making cuts to the fund. The Republican-led FCC voted on a series of cuts in 2017 that would ban telecoms that don’t operate their own network infrastructure but instead resell service from larger telecom companies, from offering Lifeline service. That small policy change would force about 70 percent, or 8 million, current Lifeline recipients to find new service—if they can. The FCC’s chairman, Ajit Pai, also proposed capping Lifeline spending, which would further reduce the number of Americans who can sign up for the subsidy. Together, the two moves would drastically reduce the number of people who can receive Lifeline support as well as the number of providers that offer the income-subsidized service. The additional money made available after the cuts will instead go to the part of the Universal Service Fund that’s supposed to help telecommunications providers build out service in rural areas that are expensive to connect, according to Greta Byrum, the co-director of the Digital Equity Laboratory at the New School and an expert on rebuilding communications networks and resiliency planning after disasters. It’s from that portion of USF money, called the Connect America Fund, that the FCC wants to draw hundreds of millions of dollars for telecom companies to build new infrastructure throughout the islands. The entire Universal Service Fund pays out about $8.5 billion a year, and the Connect America pool totals to more than half of that, at $4.5 billion. While rebuilding the communications networks on the islands is incredibly important, the large pool of money being set aside to help do so is poised to fund the work of private contractors and existing telecom companies, who according to FCC spokesman Mike Wigfield, are supposed to offer services at “reasonably comparable” rates to what Americans pay in urban areas. $258 million of the nearly $900 million is supposed to go to building out new 4G networks across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, a level of service that’s not available across most of the continental United States. By forcing providers that accept assistance from the Universal Service Fund to keep rates to the amount people in U.S. cities pay, the FCC is trying to preclude price gouging, always a worry after a natural disaster. But the amounts they do charge may still be too pricy for the vast majority of Puerto Ricans. Although nearly 20 percent of Puerto Ricans are signed up for the Lifeline program, that figure represents only about 60 percent of the households on the island that are eligible for the program. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 43 percent of Puerto Ricans fell below the poverty line in 2017, a figure that’s surely higher post-Maria. All of that means the FCC’s funding could be going to build networks nearly half of Puerto Rico’s people won’t be able to afford—and others could find hard to pay. “So instead of subsidizing the people of Puerto Rico who rely on Lifeline to afford basic utilities service, this new move from the FCC appears to essentially give $900 million to telecommunications companies to build potentially better infrastructure than what we have in parts of New York,” said Byrum. Though the FCC says it’s “seeking comment on injecting almost $900 million in medium- and long-term funding into expanding and improving broadband access on the islands,” much of that money isn’t new, and in fact, was already earmarked to go to the area. The FCC already gives $131.3 million a year to islands as part of the Universal Service Fund, according to the agency’s data. The plan then is to add an additional $10.5 million a year for 10 years for rebuilding fixed services, meaning broadband and phone infrastructure that goes to homes and businesses, and about $7 million a year for three years for building out and upgrading mobile networks. That’s an additional $126 million over the course of the funding. Is all of this really a problem, if the money in the USF is going to the place with the greatest need? Experts in rebuilding critical infrastructure after storms think so. “I’m worried that the precedent that we’re setting here is that we are going to continue to drain the Universal Service Fund every time there’s a series of disasters, which in recent years, have been increasing quite significantly,” said Jesse M. Keenan, a professor of architecture at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard, who focuses on regulatory responses to repair infrastructure after major disasters. Companies in other regulated utility sectors, Keenan says, are required either by federal regulation or their shareholders to have resilience and continuity planning completed in case of a disaster. But that’s not the case in the communications sector, he says, which is comparatively unregulated and is instead relying on the money paid into the Universal Service Fund to help subsidize repairs and improvements to their networks—money that might have otherwise go to help people pay for services who are deeply below the poverty line. “There’s no shortage of disasters, which means that whatever money goes into USF in the future will very quickly be drained into whatever the next disaster de jour is,” Keenan said. Usually after a major storm, the FCC issues a basic report outlining the scope of the disaster and lists what needs to be done to bring the area back to connectivity. It’s also common for the agency to hold public hearings to assess with the affected community how to best move forward to serve their rebuilding efforts. Such reports and hearings help to plan the response and inform how to respond to other disasters in the future. This time, however, the FCC didn’t do that—no hearings, no report. “This is a shame,” wrote Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel in her partial-dissent to the announcement on Tuesday. “Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands deserve the same treatment from this agency as communities on the mainland.” Still, even without a proper assessment of the area’s many telecommunications problems from the FCC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands need to rebuild their communications systems, if not make them even better than they were before the storm. The increased funding from the FCC should help, even if it’s unclear whether residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will be able to afford the new services, or whether it’s even actually enough to do the job. But what is clear is that the FCC has been working to reduce the scope of its phone and internet subsidy program for people in deep poverty for months, a program that hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans rely on to pay for their phone and internet. The people who definitely stand to benefit from the upgrades being funded by the FCC, meanwhile, aren’t just the service providers. In the aftermath of the storms, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have flocked to the territory. They’ll need good working internet and reliable communications infrastructure to build their new enterprises and mine their bitcoins and other digital currencies, and they’ll probably be able to afford it.","Eight months after hurricanes Maria and Irma, large swaths of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still don’t have reliable internet access and phone service—denying the Americans that live there a crucial life line as the islands continue their recoverie…",2018-06-01T15:45:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Connection Racket,https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/the-fcc-plan-to-restore-puerto-rico-internet-and-phone-service-has-a-trade-off.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/d8bd495b-e381-4b54-b88e-b6f104610460.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,Irma,1
Associated Press,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Emergency Management Agency wrongly released to a contractor the personal information of 2.3 million survivors of devastating 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, potentially exposing the victims to identity fraud and theft, a government watchdog reported Friday.
The Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General found the breach occurred when FEMA was working with a contractor that helps provide temporary housing to those affected by disasters. FEMA is one of Homeland Security’s many agencies; the sprawling 240,000-person department also includes immigration enforcement, and the U.S. Secret Service.
FEMA officials said that since the discovery of the issue, the agency was no longer sharing unnecessary data with the contractor and has conducted a detailed review of the contractor’s information system and has found no indication to suggest data has been compromised.
The agency said in a statement it is working with the contractor to remove the data from its system and has instructed staff to complete additional privacy training.
“FEMA’s goal remains protecting and strengthening the integrity, effectiveness, and security of our disaster programs that help people before, during, and after disasters,” FEMA Press Secretary Lizzie Litzow said in a statement.
Some information, like names, last four digits of a Social Security number and how many people live in a household are required to confirm eligibility and locate housing for victims. But FEMA also provided the contractor with bank names electronic funds transfer numbers and bank transit numbers that were not required by the contractor.
The 2.3 million people lived through California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
The watchdog said that FEMA violated both federal privacy laws and also Homeland Security policy by giving the extra data to the contractor, whose name was redacted in the report made public Friday.
The contractor also knew that FEMA was providing too much personal data but didn’t inform the disaster relief agency.
The 2017 hurricane season was particularly brutal. Harvey slammed ashore in Texas on Aug. 25, 2017, as a powerful Category 4 storm. It killed 68 people and deluged much of the Houston metropolitan area — home to more than 6 million people — with 3 to 4 feet of water. Flooding damaged more than 300,000 structures and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center . Irma struck Florida Sept. 10 and battered Georgia and North Carolina, killing 129 and devastating the Florida Keys. Maria made landfall Sept. 20, devastating Puerto Rico and plunging much of the island into darkness for months after, causing major damage and leaving nearly 3,000 people dead.
Wildfires in California in 2017 burned some 1.2 million acres of land, destroyed more than 10,800 structures and killed at least 46, and insurance claims topped $3.3 billion.

"USA TODAY GoEscape Summer magazine, Alexis Korman, USA TODAY GoEscape Summer magazine","Isla Verde Beach (Photo: Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Beach Resort) Late summer of 2017 is a time that many Caribbean island inhabitants likely won’t soon forget. In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes swept through the region, leaving a path of destruction and turning postcard-perfect beach locales into scenes resembling war-torn battlefields. Hurricane Irma, one of the Atlantic’s strongest hurricanes on record, pummeled St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Sept. 6, causing widespread devastation. On the U.S. mainland, Irma made landfall on Sept. 10, battering parts of Florida, including Miami and the Florida Keys, which has been considered the state’s hardest-hit region. The storm destroyed portions of U.S. Highway 1, aka Overseas Highway, which connects the mainland to the 125-mile chain of five islands, knocked down power lines, severed drinking-water supplies and cut off cellphone and internet service. Irma also destroyed hundreds of homes, trailers and RVs, and knocked awnings off businesses. Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. Virgin Islands again a week later, then caused staggering damage in Dominica, making landfall Sept. 18, before moving on two days later to Puerto Rico, where it left the U.S. territory in shambles — devastation so extensive that it took months for portions of the fragile power grid to be up and running. Forecasters suggest it may take decades for the island to fully recover. The storm also caused damage elsewhere in the Caribbean. Thankfully, within weeks of the record-breaking hurricanes, many of these meccas for sun-worshipping tourists were on the road to recovery, and the restoration continues. Take the Florida Keys, where nearly 80 percent of all hotel units are now open. “Lodging properties and other tourism facilities in the Keys have made an amazing rebound since last fall,” says Jim DeKeyrel, Florida Keys and Key West director of sales for the Monroe County Tourist Development Council. In Puerto Rico, many hotels and other lodging sites were destroyed, at least partly. Currently, 121 hotels and 4,000 restaurants are open. “San Juan is back, and there is a lot of optimism in the air,” says Kevin Rodriguez, a realtor from Guaynabo, who notes a recent uptick in his short-term vacation rentals. With many Caribbean destinations offering uncharacteristically low prices, there’s never been a better time to head to the beach. Here’s our guide to destinations in Florida and the Caribbean that have rebounded: FLORIDA KEYS “Walking down Duval Street, you couldn’t really tell that there had been a Category 5 hurricane,” says frequent Keys vacationer, Karen Hutzler, who last visited in April. “I also went in October right after the hurricane, volunteering with Samaritan’s Purse, and Keys like Cudjoe looked horrendous. Luckily, Key West was spared that kind of damage.” Traffic rolls on the Florida Keys Overseas Highway's Seven Mile Bridge near Marathon, Fla. (Photo: Andy Newman/Florida Keys News Bureau) While some parts of the lower Keys are still rebuilding, many attractions are now open to visitors. The Theater of the Sea in Islamorada — one of the world’s oldest marine mammal facilities — is open with a restored beach and gift shops (although its shark area is undergoing repairs). Outdoor enthusiasts can visit the National Key Deer Refuge and Great White Heron National Wildlife Refuge. Key West National Wildlife Refuge on Big Pine Key is set to open in the fall. The luxurious Playa Largo Resort on Key Largo makes for a beautiful home base for exploring the Keys. On Islamorada, Cheeca Lodge &amp; Spa underwent a $20 million renovation, complete with a rebuilt wooden fishing pier. Isla Verde Beach, Puerto Rico (Photo: Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Beach Resort) BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS A favorite destination for divers, many British Virgin Islands operators such as Sunchaser Scuba and Sail Caribbean Divers resumed tour offerings in February. (Silver lining: The recent hurricanes exposed new structures at some of BVI’s most popular wrecks, like The Beata in Wreck Alley.) PUERTO RICO Travel expert and journalist Kathleen Squires says airfares were low in the months after the hurricane: “My husband is from San Juan, and we have spent a lot of time there post-hurricane. Just a walk along Loiza Street demonstrates the incredible art scene that continues, as well as new boutique shopping options.” Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Beach Resort in Puerto Rico (Photo: Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Beach Resort) The Dreamcatcher — an antique-filled, vegetarian bed-and-breakfast with a bohemian vibe — reopened in the San Juan area of Ocean Park just weeks after Hurricane Maria. Family-friendly Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde Beach Resort near San Juan’s airport fared well during the storm, and has a new rooftop event space, Las Brisas. The midcentury modern La Concha Resort in Condado is renowned for its seashell-shaped restaurant, Perla. The Shore Club in Turks and Caicos (Photo: The Shore Club) TURKS AND CAICOS Though many buildings suffered water damage in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria, structural damage was limited on Providenciales, particularly in tourist-focused Grace Bay, leaving the British territory a top choice for Caribbean travel in 2018. Located on 12 lush acres, The Palms in Turks and Caicos closed for a short period post-hurricane for minor repairs, but has since resumed serving guests at its luxe 72-suite resort and 25,000-square-foot spa. The Shore Club is another choice on Providenciales, with 106 ocean-view suites and 850 feet of beachfront. ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA While Antigua escaped the hurricane season with minimal damage, its sister island, Barbuda, is rebuilding much of its infrastructure following near devastation during Hurricane Irma. The monstrous storm hit Barbuda, causing an initial $600 million worth of damage and destroyed 95 percent of Barbuda’s infrastructure. Beach on the island of Barbuda (Photo: Barbuda Belle) Early estimates indicated 44 percent of the island’s structures had to be demolished and rebuilt. But determined residents are returning, and the upscale boutique Barbuda Belle hotel (barbudabelle.com) is scheduled to welcome guests in November. The island is home to a magnificent frigate bird sanctuary and boasts pink sand beaches. Snorkelers view a starfish on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Photo: United States Virgin Islands Department of Tourism) U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS After back-to-back hurricanes, St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John continue recovery efforts, but Spirit, Delta and JetBlue have announced expanded service to St. Thomas. A message on the USVI tourism site emphasizes that the U.S. territory islands are open for business: “Our recovery from last year’s storms has been very strong. Power has been restored. Beaches and attractions have reopened... and the USVI spirit is as warm and inviting as ever. Airlines and cruise lines have returned to our shores, and many hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and condominiums are availableto overnight visitors even as our rebuilding work continues.” Perched above scenic Pacquereau Bay, the Marriott’s Frenchman’s Cove, located in St. Thomas, began welcoming visitors in February.

ABC News,"The White House has sent Congress a $44 billion disaster aid request that's already under attack from lawmakers from hurricane-hit regions as way too small. The request issued Friday, President Donald Trump's third since hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria slammed the Gulf Coast and Caribbean, would bring the total appropriated for disaster relief this fall close to $100 billion — and that's before most of the money to rebuild Puerto Rico's devastated housing stock and electric grid is added in. The new installment would add $24 billion to the government's chief disaster account and establish a new $12 billion grant program for flood risk mitigation projects. Smaller amounts would go to small business loans and to aid farmers suffering crop losses. The request followed lobbying by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who pressed the White House for far more. There are sure to be attempts to add to the measure as it advances through the House and Senate. ""This request does not come close to what local officials say is needed,"" said New York Rep. Nita Lowey, top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Even before the measure was delivered, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called it ""wholly inadequate."" Cornyn worked in September to nearly double Trump's initial request for Harvey aid and has been battling with the White House behind the scenes. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded, ""I don't think $44 billion is a low amount and my guess is if you asked any average citizen across this country they wouldn't feel that it's low either."" She said Texas ""should step up"" and provide state money to the rebuilding efforts. But she said damage assessments in Puerto Rico hadn't been completed yet and additional requests were expected. The measure arrives as lawmakers and the White House face numerous budget-related issues by year's end, including a deadline of Dec. 8 to avert a government shutdown. Top Capitol Hill leaders are also negotiating bipartisan spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies in hopes of passing a catchall government funding bill. They are also seeking to renew a popular program that provides health care to children from low-income families. And there's a tax bill that is Republicans' top priority. GOP leaders have appeared wary of tackling other budget-related issues while the tax legislation was taking shape but time is running low and coming weeks are likely to bring a burst of activity. Talks on increasing tight ""caps"" on agency budgets have centered on a GOP plan for a two-year, $182 billion increase that still falls short of demands by both defense hawks and Democrats seeking more for domestic programs. Rossello has requested $94 billion, including $18 billion to rebuild the island's power grid and $31 billion for housing. The White House anticipates sending another request focused on the needs of the island territory but hasn't indicated when that would be. ""Because Hurricane Maria occurred more recently, damage assessments are ongoing,"" said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney also asked lawmakers to consider $59 billion in spending cuts to pay for the aid, including $44 billion from benefit programs by extending automatic cuts known as sequestration over the 2025-2027 budget window. Texas and Florida officials also expressed disappointment. Abbott, the Texas governor, submitted a $61 billion request to Trump last month for Harvey-related damages, including ambitious requests for flood control and navigation projects. He called the White House request ""completely inadequate."" The Florida congressional delegation asked for $27 billion. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, said in a statement that the request ""doesn't come close to providing what is needed. People are hurting and they desperately need our help, yet this request has no money to provide housing for evacuees and barely any money for Florida's citrus growers. That's unacceptable."" ""Congress needs to pass a more robust disaster bill that actually provides the funding needed to help people recover,"" Nelson said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Congress had ""proven its commitment to aid those suffering from the natural disasters of the fall."" Ryan said the House would ""review the request and work with the administration and members from affected states to help the victims get the resources they need to recover and rebuild."" —— Associated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.","The White House has sent Congress a $44 billion disaster aid request that's already under attack from lawmakers from hurricane-hit regions as way too small.

Sruthi Ramakrishnan,"The home-improvement chain beat on both the top and bottom lines, boosted by lower costs and strong demand for emergency supplies due to the hurricanes. Same-store sales rose 5.7% versus a year ago, beating the Wall Street estimate of 4.6% growth. (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc reported higher-than-expected comp sales and profit on Tuesday, helped by lower costs as well as higher demand for emergency supplies and rebuilding material due to hurricanes battering several regions in the United States. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 5.7 percent, above the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said hurricane-related sales in the quarter were about $200 million. The retailer also said Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron would retire and would be replaced by the president of Lowe's international business, Richard Maltsbarger, effective Feb. 3. Larger rival Home Depot Inc raised its full-year forecasts last week after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma spurred demand for emergency supplies and rebuilding materials even as the retailer benefits from a multi-year recovery in the housing market. Promotions to woo professional contractors, a clientele with deeper pockets than Lowe's traditional client base of do-it-yourself customers also helped the retailer post comparable sales above the company average in the third quarter, Lowe's Chief Executive Robert Niblock said. Selling and general expenses fell about 7 percent to $3.81 billion in the quarter ended Nov. 3. Net income rose to $872 million, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter, from $379 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-ago quarter had included $462 million of non-cash pre-tax charges. Net sales rose 6.6 percent to $16.77 billion.

Laignee Barron,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it did not have a “phasing” plan in place for getting resources to Puerto Rico when Hurricane Maria devastated the island last September. Meanwhile the agency’s supply warehouse on Puerto Rico had zero cots, zero tarps and an almost negligible stockpile of food and water, its limited contents depleted during another storm two weeks earlier. In short, FEMA was badly underprepared for one of the worst disasters to strike Puerto Rico, the agency acknowledges in a new report assessing its response to the 2017 hurricane season. In quick succession, three major storms slammed into the United States in 2017, leading to “unprecedented” demands on the agency’s staffing, resources and budget. Nearly 4.8 million households impacted by the 2017 storm season and the California wildfires requested assistance from FEMA, more than the previous 10 years combined. Harvey, Irma and Maria were each among the five costliest hurricanes on record and collectively inflicted $265 billion in damages. Amid competing major disasters, the overstretched agency struggled to provide relief to storm victims, but drew particular criticism for its response in Puerto Rico. The agency’s report depicts a chaotic situation where incomplete planning “under-estimated the actual requirements” and led to “differences between the expected and actual impacts” on the ground. The agency said it was not prepared for Puerto Rico’s “insufficiently maintained infrastructure (e.g., the electrical grid),” and had not bargained on the local government’s cashflow problems. The report states that while the agency had committed to updating its Caribbean Response Plan before the 2017 season, the plan was incomplete by the time the hurricane hit, forcing the response operation to devise portions of the agenda on the fly. Plans also relied on a five-year-old earthquake and tsunami manual that had not anticipated a hurricane would affect the U.S. territory’s entire population of over 3 million. When Maria landed in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it knocked out electricity as well as most of the cellphone towers, rendering communication about who needed what, and where, almost impossible. Most of the agency’s logistical staff were already deployed to Florida and Texas, in response to hurricanes Irma and Harvey. To cope with shortages, FEMA said it promoting staffers into leadership positions that in some cases exceeded their abilities. Critics of FEMA’s response in Puerto Rico have alleged discrepancies between recovery efforts on the mainland versus the island territory. A Harvard study estimates there were as many as 4,600 deaths associated with Maria. FEMA’s report said the fatalities were being reviewed by Puerto Rico’s government. The White House has defended the federal response to Maria. President Donald Trump went so far as to say, “I’d say it was a 10” on a scale of 10. Ten months later, nearly 1,000 households in Puerto Rico still lack power, according to the New York Times, while thousands of islanders who took shelter on the mainland have been unable to return. FEMA’s report notes that a full recovery from 2017’s storms will take years.","When Hurricane Maria hit, more than 80% of Puerto Rico's supply warehouse was already depleted",2018-07-13T06:40:26Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",FEMA Says It Was Significantly Unprepared When Hurricane Maria Hit Puerto Rico,http://time.com/5337866/fema-report-unprepared-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gettyimages-858839814.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Irma,1

(Photo: Provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via Florida Today) ORLANDO — As a child in a small town northwest of Phoenix, Ken Graham became fascinated by Arizona's monsoons, lightning storms and desert flooding. Weather has remained his passion throughout his adult life, and his meteorological career has landed him a high-profile job in the South Florida tropics. Sunday, Graham starts work as director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. “I’m super excited. I think, at the same time, really humbled. I’m a forecaster and meteorologist at heart. I’ve been telling everybody I’ve wanted to do this since I was 7 years old,” Graham said Wednesday during the National Hurricane Conference at Hilton Orlando. “We’re in the heart of preparedness season. So I’m going to really hit the ground running, talking to folks about preparedness for the hurricane season. It’s going to be a quick ramp-up,” Graham said. The 2018 Atlantic hurricane season kicks off June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.

He served from 2012 until last May, when he returned to his former job as a hurricane expert on The Weather Channel. “The director’s really the face of the organization to the outside world, to the media, the emergency management community. The director’s job has a big outward-facing component, in terms of our outreach and preparedness messaging so that everyone gets ready for hurricane season,"" said Mike Brennan, branch chief of the National Hurricane Center's hurricane specialist unit. “And also, during a land-falling hurricane, he becomes the face of the real-time messaging through our media pool and interviews and television, trying to get the word out,"" Brennan said. Last Slide Next Slide The “extremely active” 2017 Atlantic hurricane season produced 17 named storms — including the first two major hurricanes to strike the continental U.S. since Wilma hit Florida in October 2005. Harvey dumped more than 60 inches of rain on southeast Texas, triggering catastrophic flooding and causing at least 68 deaths in the Lone Star State. Then Irma swept across the Caribbean and struck Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, directly causing seven deaths and indirectly causing 85 more in the U.S., the National Hurricane Center reported. Shortly afterward, Maria walloped the Caribbean and Puerto Rico.

All said, 10 hurricanes churned across the Atlantic basin last year, including six major hurricanes of Category 3, 4 or 5 strength. That ranked as the seventh most-active season on record, dating to 1851. ""What a historic season. For me, I’m so fortunate I'm going to work with some amazing world-class scientists at the Hurricane Center. The forecasts, the modeling are getting so much better,"" Graham said. ""It's a challenge anywhere when you're talking about these tropical systems — these impacts could be literally hundreds of miles away.

During graduate school, he worked as a broadcast meteorologist at WCBI-TV in Columbus, Miss. He went on to work National Weather Service jobs in Fort Worth, Texas; Silver Spring, Md.; Birmingham, Ala., and Corpus Christi, Texas. Most recently, he was meteorologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service’s New Orleans/Baton Rouge office since 2008. With June 1 looming on the calendar, Graham said residents along hurricane-vulnerable coasts should review their storm-preparation plans. ""Take the lessons learned from last season and start looking at your own plan. Even with my own family, we do that every year about this time of year — we review where we would go if we were evacuated, we review what papers we need to bring with us, or medicines,"" Graham said.

While Popovich was speaking with reporters ahead of Tuesday's game against the Nets, he began discussing why he gave back to the community through charity and other works, and his comments were just what you'd expect from Pop. According to ESPN's Michael C. Wright, Pop said that it was important for him and others in a similar situation to give back "" Because we’re rich as hell and we don’t need it all, and other people need it. Then, you're an a-- if you don't give it. Pretty simple."" When you put it that way coach, it is pretty simple. Popovich is quite active with a variety of charities both as a donor and volunteer, from local efforts such as the San Antonio Food Bank to more national and international nonprofits such as Shoes that Fit and the Innocence Project. As Wright noted, these contributions don't often get publicized, such as his recent donation to relief efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Popovich is already known as inviting, a good tipper, and one to stand up and speak out for what he believes in. He's one of the most respected men across the NBA, but for anyone trying to be more like Pop every day, his moral code is a rather simple one that's easy to follow.","The San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is known for his charitable giving, including work with organizations such as Shoes that Fit and the Innocence Project.

Travis Fedschun,"The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be just as busy this year, but not as destructive as the record-breaking season in 2017, researchers said Thursday. The pre-season forecast from Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project calls for 14 named storms, of which seven are predicted to strengthen into hurricanes, with three becoming major storms that are Category 3 or higher. Hurricane researchers note that warm waters in the western Atlantic Ocean and a weaker El Niño may be blamed for an uptick in storms. ""El Niño tends to increase upper-level westerly winds across the Caribbean into the tropical Atlantic, tearing apart hurricanes as they try to form,"" the researchers said in their report. Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Jose (R) and Hurricane Katia (L) are pictured in the Atlantic Ocean in this September 7, 2017 NOAA satellite photo. (NOAA) The research team predicts that 2018 hurricane activity will be about 135 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2017’s hurricane season was about 245 percent of the average season and featured Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which devastated parts of the United States and portions of the Caribbean. PUERTO RICO IN 'FRAGILE STATE' SIX MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA The lead author of the report, Phil Klotzbach, said that the 2018 hurricane season is exhibiting characteristics similar to 1960, 1967, 1996, 2006 and 2011. “The years 1960, 1967 and 2006 had near-average Atlantic hurricane activity, while 1996 and 2011 were both above-normal hurricane seasons,” he said. Hurricane Joaquin is seen over the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean in an image from the NOAA GOES West satellite taken October 1, 2015. (NOAA) The 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, and this year includes the names : Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gordon, Helene, Isaac, Joyce, Kirk, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sara, Tony, Valerie, and William. HURRICANE HARVEY IS SECOND-MOST COSTLY HURRICANE IN US HISTORY BEHIND KATRINA, REPORT SAYS Researchers at Colorado State said they plan to give updates on their forecast on May 31, July 2 and Aug. 2. They also caution that their forecast is ""intended to provide a best estimate of activity,"" and warn residents in coastal area to take proper precautions regardless. “It takes only one storm near you to make this an active season,” said Department of Atmospheric Science Associate Professor Michael Bell.

Jeremy Berke,"Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont have developed a new passion over the last year: assisting with rescue and recovery efforts in disaster-stricken areas. The couple, who originally hail from Florida, run an adventure-travel company called What's Next Adventures. But they've spent the last week helping people trapped in homes that flooded during Hurricane Florence. ""Our backgrounds are like a little puzzle that fit really well with these disasters,"" Shipley told Business Insider. Shipley is a certified EMT, holds a captain's license, and is certified in swift-water and high angle rescue. Beaumont also holds a captain's license and has a host of experience in wilderness first-aid and swift-water rescue scenarios. The couple spends the majority of their time on the road living out of their truck — which they called ""really cozy""— when not guiding clients on sailing and rock-climbing adventures. Last week, when they saw Florence approaching North Carolina, they raced over in their truck to see how they could help. Pulling people out of flooded homes On Sunday evening, during the height of Hurricane Florence's flooding, Shipley and Beaumont had just rescued some stranded people from a road that was quickly flooding when a family pulled up next to them in a car. ""They asked me which road they could take to get out of town,"" Beaumont said. He told the family that they'd probably get into serious trouble if they tried navigating flooded roads in their car. ""There was a moment of realization for the mother and father. The question was asked to me: 'If these were your children, what would you do?'"" Beaumont said. ""That's a really powerful question."" He replied: ""Well I know one thing. You guys are going to survive in the shelter, and I don't know what will happen to you if you don't."" So Beaumont and Shipley helped the family get to a shelter safely in their truck, which was able to pass over the flooded roads. Shipley and Beaumont participate in a high-water rescue in Lumberton, North Carolina. Courtesy of Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont 'When no one else is available, we'll move in to help' Every day is different when you're responding to a disaster, Shipley said. The couple is living out of their truck in North Carolina right now and working with a group of volunteer rescuers. They've spent the past few days assisting with transporting trapped residents to a local hurricane shelter. They monitor radio channels, social media, and 911 calls, while staying in touch with local authorities to see where they're most needed. Once they get a call, they'll race out to conduct a rescue with their local partners. Often, they use their truck to tow their inflatable boat — affectionately named Red Duck — into flooded neighborhoods. ""When no one else is available, we'll move in to help,"" Shipley said. Shipley and Beaumont's truck and their inflatable boat, Red Duck. The truck serves as both a home and a mobile operating base. Courtesy of Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont On Friday, Shipley said, the couple headed to Richlands, North Carolina, a town hit by severe flooding. On the way, the couple came across a bridge that was being overrun with water. ""We were standing by trying to see if the water would recede,"" Shipley said. ""And while we were there, a family was trying to come across. It was a mom, dad, two young daughters, an autistic son, and three dogs."" The family was trying to cross the bridge in a friend's boat, but the boat got stuck. ""So we're carrying people and pets across the water. The woman was asthmatic. As soon as we got her over, we had to help her medically,"" Shipley said. She gave the woman albuterol, an asthma drug. ""Once you get on the ground, you just find yourself in a situation and you have to go from there,"" Shipley said. Shipley and Beaumont participate in a high-water rescue in Lumberton, North Carolina. Courtesy of Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont The following day, Beaumont and Shipley were sent to help rescue a man in Lumberton, a town hit hard by the floods. The man had initially chosen not to evacuate because he had pets. When they arrived, Shipley said, two more families also needed to be rescued. So they had to quickly adapt the plan to get everyone to safety. One of the most interesting things about rescuing people from their homes, Beaumont said, is learning what's valuable to them. ""One of the families that we picked up, they wanted to grab photo albums,"" he said. Another person they helped didn't want to take anything with him. Beaumont noticed that the man had awards from military service in his home that looked ""quite prestigious."" But he left them behind. Helping in the Keys during Hurricane Irma Shipley and Beaumont assist with the recovery after Hurricane Irma in the Florida Keys last year. Courtesy of Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont Beaumont and Shipley started helping with hurricane rescue work last year during Hurricane Irma. ""We ended up staying in the Florida Keys for nine weeks,"" Beaumont said. ""We were really able to help people put their lives back together."" For the couple, assisting with that recovery effort meant loading up an 85-foot sailboat with construction materials and helping local residents in the Keys and the Bahamas clear roadways, patch roofs, and clean up their communities after the storm. ""It's not about big, life-saving operations,"" Shipley said, though the couple has participated in some hair-raising rescues. Often, their work simply involves gathering people with rakes and shovels and helping clear yards after the water recedes. Shipley and Beaumont sleep in their truck, which they say is actually quite comfortable. Courtesy of Nancy Shipley and Ian Beaumont ""We just roll with the punches,"" Beaumont said. ""That's what we do every day, all the time."" As for what's next, Shipley said the couple plans to stay in North Carolina as long as they're needed. ""We never really have a plan,"" she said. The couple has also heard about bad flooding in Virginia — so if they're able to help, they'll just pack up and go overnight. ""We live on the road, we're very comfortable just moving,"" Shipley said.

EENWERK [ONE WORK] presents one work at a time, inviting both maker and spectator to concentrate on content and form. A diversity of spaces, differing in height, in the way sunlight enters and in the way they connect to the outside, give the makers a range of conditions to work with and challenges them to interact with the architecture. © Peter Tijhuis Occupying an open space between a row of early 20th century houses EENWERK is a 155m², three floor, glass and basalt structure with a steel construction that allows it to be open and transparent. The house to the right of EENWERK, home to Irma Boom Office, has windows on the side. In order to clear them the front façade of EENWERK is pushed back from the street in three steps. A diagonal step in the middle gives it a dynamic sculptural quality. The effect is that EENWERK is hidden from view until one nears the building and changes in composition as one moves past. The basalt surfaces emphasize the sculptural aspect of the façade and partially close it off to create intimacy, to frame the views and to let light and shadow change the experience of the architecture throughout the day and the seasons. © Peter Tijhuis Every floor of EENWERK is different. The ground floor, 4.5m high, has windows facing north and a large garage door that is accessible from the back. When the weather permits this space can be extended to the garden in the back. It might be used to hold a reception or to park a car. The middle floor, 3m high, has large windows on both ends making it a very transparent space where the views towards the street and the park set the atmosphere. Seen from outside, the large window in front acts like a billboard displaying the buildings activity to the public. The top floor of EENWERK is a greenhouse equally well suited for growing plants and vegetables as it is for presenting work in an Arcadian setting or a unique climatic condition. © Peter Tijhuis Section AA © Peter Tijhuis Irma Boom’s office (IBO) is located on the ground floor of the classical house right next to EENWERK. A stair built out of thick aluminum plates connects the office to the library on the first floor. The library houses Irma Boom’s collection of experimental books and is intended as a place where people who love books can discuss and work on them. IBO and EENWERK are vertically organized as individual entities but openings in the wall between IBO and EENWERK make it possible to connect them horizontally.

Phil Keating,"MARATHON, Fla. – Expect a near normal to slightly above normal 2018 hurricane season. About 10 to 16 named tropical storms, five to nine of those becoming hurricanes, and one to four becoming powerful major hurricanes, categories 3, 4 and 5. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, released its 2018 forecast from its Lakeland, Fla. “There’s tens and tens and tens of millions of people threatened by hurricane season,” said NOAA’s lead hurricane forecaster Jerry Bell. “They need to heed the warning, that hurricane season is coming and you need to start preparing now. Hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30. NOAA’s not expecting an El Nino summer, which produces wind shear that helps break up developing storms in the Atlantic and Caribbean, nor a La Nina climate pattern, which results in more active seasons. So, the forecast is for a hurricane season that’s about average. In 2017, there were three devastating hurricanes: Harvey, which slammed and flooded southeast Texas; Irma, which whipped through the lower Florida Keys as a Category 4 and pushed up the state and Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico. In the Florida Keys, in particular, there is serious concern—even fear—about another hurricane strike in the next few months. Irma debris is still clogging and littering many canals, destroyed homes still haven’t been demolished, hotels and businesses remain closed and, most importantly for local government leaders, their “rainy day funds” were depleted on Irma. The rainy day funds are now tapped out. And tens of millions of FEMA disaster reimbursement dollars have still not arrived. ""I really believe bureaucracy is showing its evil head,” laments Islamorada City Councilman Mike Forster. ""We have submitted $6 million in FEMA reimbursement requests, and to date, we've not received a dime."" ""Nothing.” Monroe County spent and submitted $35 million in disaster expenses. To date, the county said, FEMA has paid $600,000. FEMA explains the time it takes to get the money is necessary to fully vet each submission, to avoid fraud, so the U.S. taxpayer doesn’t get fleeced. FEMA administrator Brock Long told Fox News ""recovery unfortunately is not something that occurs overnight. In many cases, the money that will come to the state and ultimately to the local level will be coming over years, and so the recovery process is a very long delivery process.” At last week’s Governor’s Hurricane Conference in West Palm Beach, Long also bluntly warned all local and state governments not to depend on FEMA in the first few days of a hurricane strike, that they must have a plan and be prepared for the possibility of loss of power, cell phone service, roads washed out and stock up with food and water supplies for post-hurricane distribution centers. Much of the bureaucratic headache, explains Islamorada’s Forster, is all the red tape. Once the storm hits, the locals spend their limited funds for cleanup, then submit their reimbursement expenses to FEMA. In Florida, when FEMA approves the payout, it sends that money to the state’s Division of Emergency management, which is then charged with dispersing the dollars. And if the paperwork has any errors, even lacking an exact GPS coordinate of something destroyed, the paper chain continues to go back and forth while the money awaits. Throughout the Keys, all of the tons and tons of debris on land—14,000 dump trucks worth—has been removed. But the canals and offshore, under the water so popular with snorkelers, scuba divers and sport fishermen, remain clogged with un-removed debris, an estimated 100,000 cubic yards of it. On a recent Friday, NOAA-trained volunteer divers with the Clean Seas Florida Keys program removed 155 pounds of trash near the National Marine Sanctuary. Dive operator Rainbow Reef Dive Center’s Luke Dorso is one of the first dive operators trained by NOAA in marine debris cleanup. They hoisted up crab traps, lobster traps, chains and anchors onto volunteer boats. On lower Matecumbe Key in Islamorada, about halfway from Miami to Key West, lifelong resident Robert Moser is now rebuilding his house. Last September, Irma destroyed his old home. But the canals around his neighborhood remain unnavigable. And practically every homeowner here owns a boat, which is the reason they moved to the Keys in the first place. “This requires, unfortunately, our government to help us, says Moser. “And FEMA has failed us.” Despite that opinion, for its part, FEMA promises the money will come. Everyone living along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts should start preparing. Below average or above average hurricane season, no matter. As the Florida Keys residents will tell you, it really does only take one to ruin your life.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September. It took several months to restore electricity to most of the region — and then suddenly, on April 18, an island-wide blackout put residents back in the dark again. ""It’s like the hurricane came all over again,"" says Norma I. Melendez, 55, who's lived in Patillas since age 3. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" SEE ALSO: The power is out again in Puerto Rico, 7 months after Hurricane Maria Despite the sense of despair, local residents like Melendez are organizing to provide the community essential resources, such as clothes, food, medical supplies, and access to medical examinations. That story of improvisation and resilience is common across Puerto Rico, despite slow-moving recovery efforts. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" Though most of the island is back on the power grid, roughly 90,000 Puerto Ricans still don't have electricity, and those that do worry about and experience intermittent blackouts. The power outage last month, caused by accidental damage to a transmission line, left most of the island's 3.3 million residents without electricity for a day. While all customers are expected to have power by the end of May, that's around when hurricane season begins, and activists say the island's infrastructure is woefully unprepared for new storm-related threats. In Patillas, Melendez and her neighbors are still focused on recovery. She volunteers with and writes funding proposals for a nonprofit community organization called Guardarraya Unidos Por Un Patrimonio Educativo (GUPE), which partners with other groups like the Red Cross and Salvation Army to obtain supplies for local distribution. GUPE has handed out solar lanterns, medical equipment, food, and bottled water to residents, many of whom are 65 or older and have severe medical conditions or disabilities. The organization operates out of an abandoned school, and it doesn't have the funds to buy generators or water tanks. There are moments when the stakes and urgency of the situation feel daunting, Melendez says. But then neighbors will share medical equipment, food, or clothes with each other, often using GUPE as a conduit. “Puerto Rico's Senate has ordered government agencies to explain why tens of thousands of people in rural areas remain without power or appropriate shelter as anger grows about the lack of basic services more than 7 months after hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria.” https://t.co/xs5t2UtFtE — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) April 25, 2018 ""That gave us the energy to continue because we know that GUPE is reaching people and the people are reaching GUPE,"" she says. GUPE is receiving logistical and material support from multiple nonprofit organizations, including the aid and relief group Mercy Corps. Karla Peña, emergency response program manager for Mercy Corps, says she frequently sees a spirit of cooperation and generosity across communities in Puerto Rico. Neighbors share refrigerators and keep an eye on people with few family members in the area as well as those who can't easily travel to get food, water, and gas. Yet, that individual and collective resilience can wear thin in the absence of external support from nonprofits and the government. Indeed, there's a battle over how Puerto Rico will be rebuilt given that it has $74 billion in municipal debt, and the island's governor has moved to privatize the power authority. Community and labor activists worry that privatization will put Puerto Rico's fate in the hands of unaccountable private corporations. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time."" As that fight unfolds, many Puerto Ricans feel like they're stuck in survival mode, says Peña. During the most recent power outage last month, Peña says lines for gas and water rivaled post-hurricane levels. Even when the power is on, Peña keeps ice in the refrigerator and her ""hurricane kit"" — a camping stove and emergency supplies — at the ready. After months of use, generators break down often. Meanwhile, families have exhausted their financial resources to buy fuel. Those still without power rely on solar lanterns or, if they have one, a working generator. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time,"" Peña says. Melissa Mark-Viverito, former New York City Council Speaker and campaign director to the advocacy coalition Power 4 Puerto Rico, lauds the recovery work happening in communities across the island, but says those efforts need more support. Mark-Viverito envisions new investments in community-led projects to develop sustainable power sources, which could generate jobs and help stem the number of Puerto Ricans leaving the island to live in the United States. (Power 4 Puerto Rico recently wrote a letter to members of Congress urging them to adopt a ""community-driven"" approach to rebuilding.) But Mark-Viverito says that without meaningful support for innovative solutions developed by local communities, ""we're not going to be able to take advantage of this moment. What happened with the blackout demonstrates how vulnerable we are."" Back in Patillas, Melendez is focused on one of GUPE's many projects: providing breakfast and lunch to dozens of elderly residents who are homebound. The need pre-existed Hurricane Maria but has become more urgent in the storm's wake. Though it'll take considerable local and outside resources to provide those meals, Melendez is confident the nonprofit — and its supporters — can make it happen. ""When we fall down, or something happens or someone comes to the facilities and we don’t think we have anything for them,"" she says, ""someone else will say, 'I want to give you something if you need it.'""","The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September. It took several months to restore electricity to most of the region — and then suddenly, on April 18, an island-wide black…",2018-05-04T10:00:00Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",Puerto Ricans never know if they'll have power.

http://www.facebook.com/pix11news,"BAGHDAD — Four of the seven service members killed when a U.S. helicopter crashed in Iraq on Thursday have been identified as New York residents, the Department of Defense said Saturday. The four service members were part of a seven-member team who died when the HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopter they were flying crashed near the city of Al-Qa’im in western Iraq. Two of the victims were identified as New York City firefighters on Friday. Commack Fire Department identified one of the victims as Christopher Raguso. The 39-year-old was a flight engineer in the Air National Guard, a lieutenant with their department and in the FDNY. Lieutenant Raguso was also with Division 13 in Queens. “Chris was always there to help anyone with anything, he would never say no,” the department said, calling Raguso “a great American Patriot, friend and brother.” Fire Marshal Christopher T. “Tripp” Zanetis, 37, of the Bureau of Fire Investigation also died in the crash. Fire Marshal Zanetis was a resident of Long Island City and 10-year veteran. Two more victims have been identified as: Andreas O’Keeffe, 37, a resident of Center Moriches. O’Keeffe was an HH-60G Pave Hawk pilot and a full-time federal civilian employee. He was deployed to Iraq three times, to Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and to Texas during Hurricane Harvey. Dashan Briggs, 30, a resident of Port Jefferson Station. He was an HH-60G special missions aviation flight engineer. He was a full time military member and has previously been deployed to Afghanistan, to Texas for Hurricane Harvey and to the Caribbean for Hurricane Irma. The three other victims were identified by the Pentagon as Mark K. Weber, 29, William R. Posch, 36, and Carl P. Enis, 31. Weber was from Colorado and was assigned to the 38th Rescue Squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.. Posch and Enis both worked at the Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Pentagon officials have said there were no indications the helicopter had been shot down. In their initial statements, officials said the helicopter, which is used by the Air Force for combat search and rescue, was in transit when it went down.

Mahita Gajanan,"The C-130 military plane was on its way to retirement when it crashed in Georgia on Wednesday. All nine crew members – members of the Puerto Rican Air National Guard – died when the WC-130H hurricane hunter crashed onto a highway in Savannah, officials said. U.S. military officials are still looking into what caused the plane crash. Col. Pete Boone, the vice-commander of the 165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National Guard, told reporters investigators “will use every resource at our disposal to identify a cause.” Here’s what to know about the aviation accident so far. The pilot of the fatal flight was the father of two young boys Maj. Jose Rafael Roman, the pilot on C-130, died in the crash along with the rest of the crew, the mayor of his hometown of Manati, Puerto Rico said.Roman left behind two young sons and a wife who is five months pregnant, the Associated Press reports. “The town is in mourning,” Manati Mayor Jose Sanchez said. “My condolences to all Puerto Rican families.” The plane was on its final flight The C-130 was supposed to be on its final flight to retirement after undergoing maintenance for “a number of days,” CNN reports. Maj. Paul Dahlen, a spokesman for the Puerto Rico National Guard, told CNN the plane was on its way to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group in Arizona, where the military houses thousands of planes. The facility is also known as an “airplane boneyard,” where aircraft are sent after they are removed from service. The aircraft was at least 40 years old Col. Pete Boone, the vice-commander of the 165th Airlift Wing of the Georgia Air National Guard, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday that the aircraft was built in the late 1970s. The number contradicts earlier reports from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard that the aircraft was more than 60 years old. Boone said the plane was in Savannah for “routine maintenance” before it took off for Arizona. It crashed shortly after taking off. Boone did not detail what kind of maintenance the aircraft required. Crew members used the plane for hurricane relief The nine crew members who died in the crash pitched in during recovery efforts in the aftermaths of both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria as part of the 198th Flight Squadron. With the aircraft, the group rescued U.S. citizens stranded on the British Virgin Islands after Irma blew through, and provided food and water to Puerto Rico after Maria cut off power and utilities to hundreds of thousands of residents. Puerto Rico’s National Guard flight fleet is now down to five planes The AP reports that the C-130 was on its last flight before retirement, bringing Puerto Rico’s total number of planes to five.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"Omi Ford, 19, said she believed the large crowds emphasized how much energy is behind the gun control push this time around. “I’m here to show that the Parkland students are not alone in this, in their thinking about this, even though some people act like they are,” said Ms. Ford, an acting student at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles. The city’s mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, praised activists for their work and urged students to remain involved. Mr. Garcetti said President Trump had failed to show leadership on the issue despite promises after the Parkland shooting. “He said we shouldn’t be scared of the gun lobby and yet he buckles every time they blow a whistle for him,” he said. Nearby, a group of about 10 counterprotesters held up signs to support the Second Amendment, protected by police tape. More than a dozen police officers stood between the two camps. John Turano, 60, who wore American flag-imprinted shorts, said he decided to counterprotest in order to support the Second Amendment and “my president, Trump.” He said he did not own guns but thought efforts to restrict gun ownership were too extreme. He paused when asked what he thought about the marchers. “When you feel something passionately, and you’re in America, you’re not restricted in what you feel or what you say,” he said.

LINDA MARX,"After Ms. Vargas graduated in May 2009 with a degree in political science, the couple rented an apartment together, but struggled with cultural clashes and communication. Mr. Cheng liked to show his affection by giving Ms. Vargas gifts, or regaling her with an appropriate song. He also nurtured her with food and medicine when she was sick. But he didn’t plan birthdays, anniversaries or Valentine’s Day. “I always write a letter on birthdays,” she said, “and holidays are important so this became an issue.” Ms. Vargas also got jealous when Mr. Cheng, then a busy associate producer at WSVN-TV in Miami, hung out with a close buddy. She preferred that he spend quality time with her by going to dinner and talking. She also liked having him accompany her to places like the grocery store. Mr. Cheng wanted alone time to chill and play his guitar. “I have a big social personality and need to be away from people to recharge because I get anxious and depressed,” Mr. Cheng said. “Rahysa is an adventurer and always wanted to go places.” During one Christmas season when she asked him to help distribute toys at a homeless shelter, he declined, thinking her social interests were honorable but not as important as his television work. “I was super-selfish, and everything was about me,” he said. “They are both strong personalities, leaders, opinionated and outspoken,” said her brother, Steven Vargas. Her mother, Constanza Gomez, agreed: “They are highly dramatic with similar personalities. Each can be sitting in a different room thinking about the same things.” Ms. Vargas became unhappy after Mr. Cheng was overly argumentative. “I didn’t mean it but I was hurting,” he said. The couple split in mid-2010, partly because Ms. Vargas was eager to begin law school and Mr. Cheng was focused on becoming a broadcast reporter. “Although Chris was the love of my life, and I worried he would meet someone else, I had to let him go,” she said. Photo Dragon dancers prepare for a performance at the reception. Credit Jason LeCras for The New York Times Still, while dating others, they kept in touch by sharing the grief of his uncle’s death, divorcing parents, illness and other mercurial moments. In 2013, when Mr. Cheng returned to Miami for a job in marketing after a year in news at a Texas television station, they repeatedly ran into each other. He said he was battling depression and anxiety, and wasn’t fulfilled by his career. “Even though I wanted to marry Rahysa and have a family,” Mr. Cheng said, “she would soon be practicing law and knew I was a storm coming back and couldn’t promise her a stable life.” The next two years involved soul-searching for Mr. Cheng. He sought professional help in hopes of finding stability so he could have one more shot with the love of his life. “She was my moral compass, a together person who liked me more than I liked myself,” he said. “She made me a better human being.” In 2015, when Mr. Cheng randomly spotted Ms. Vargas’s mother in a local lounge and told her that he was desperately in love, she encouraged him to try again. After many conversations, the couple reunited and slowly learned to communicate more and fight less. “We began to accept each other’s flaws and compromise,” Ms. Vargas said. Photo The guests were captivated by the colorful dragon dancers. Credit Jason LeCras for The New York Times Within a year, they bought a house together in Miami, and agreed to take a vacation in Thailand and China. On Nov. 26, 2016, during a layover in Paris that Ms. Vargas planned to relieve Mr. Cheng’s anxiety about long flights, he escorted her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, dropped to one knee and surprised her with a proposal. “Finally!” she blurted out, followed by “Yes!” Wedding plans were temporarily disrupted last September when Hurricane Irma destroyed their new home, flooding it with 2½ feet of sewage and seawater and forcing them to move five times in four months while commissioning a total rebuild. They leaned on each other constantly. When one was weak, the other was strong. Mr. Cheng had left his marketing job earlier that year, then Ms. Vargas quit hers to concentrate on Ms. Esquire. “We spoke life into each other, and our church worship helped us endure this stressful time with unusual peace and calm,” Mr. Cheng said.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","You'll be mesmerized by this time-lapsed video of 2017's Atlantic hurricane paths. USA TODAY A view of flood waters from Hurricane Harvey near South Lake Houston Parkway on Aug. 28, 2017. (Photo: Henrietta Wildsmith, USA TODAY Network) The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season — by some measures the worst on record — officially comes to a merciful close Thursday after leaving a path of death and destruction in the U.S. and the Caribbean. Monster storms like Harvey, Irma and Maria killed dozens, perhaps hundreds of people and caused more than $206 billion in economic impact — a toll that will largely fall on individuals and the government to pay, according to one estimate from ENKI Operations. Those three names will certainly be retired by the National Hurricane Center due to their ferocity and impact in Texas, Florida, Dominica, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If that $206 billion estimate holds, it would be the costliest hurricane season in U.S. history, even topping the disastrous 2005 season, which featured Katrina. Final cost estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — the official tally from the federal government — won't be available until early in 2018. Of the total, insurance covered roughly 30%, said disaster research scientist Chuck Watson of ENKI Operations. That figure is well within insurance companies' capacity to pay, meaning premiums are unlikely to skyrocket, he said. However, the remaining cost will be paid by individuals, who may have little or no insurance, and the government, in the form of loans or grants. Coupled with the disastrous wildfires in California, federal disaster relief money will have to come from somewhere and that could eventually mean changes in spending priorities or higher taxes, Watson said. The 2017 losses included $114 billion from Hurricane Harvey, $60 billion from Hurricane Irma and $32 billion from Hurricane Maria, according to ENKI Operations. The season was a shock to the system after several relatively quiet years for hurricanes. The prevailing weather pattern this year was quite a bit different from the past decade during the USA's major landfalling hurricane drought, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach. ""The storms this year were forced further west by a pretty strong subtropical high that prevented recurvature"" out to sea, he said.. September was the true behemoth, the single most powerful month ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of hurricane intensity. In a statistic known as ""Accumulated Cyclone Energy"" (ACE), Hurricanes Irma, Katia, Jose, Lee and Maria that month generated the largest amount of energy for any month on record, according to Klotzbach. ACE is calculated by adding each tropical storm or hurricane's wind speed through its life cycle. Long-lived, intense hurricanes have a high count (Irma's ACE measured 67.5), while short-lived, weak tropical storms have a lower values (Katia came in at 6.1), according to Weather.com. Both Irma and Maria soared to Category 5 strength, the top of the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity. Irma’s landfall on Barbuda and Maria's landfall on Dominica makes 2017 only the second season on record to feature two hurricanes that hit at Category 5 strength. Other records from the season included the 60.58 inches of rain that fell near Nederland, Texas, during Harvey. This broke the record for the greatest rainfall amount ever recorded in the Lower 48 from a single storm, WeatherBug reported. Meanwhile, Irma was the strongest storm on record in the Atlantic (excluding the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with maximum winds of 185 mph. And Maria was the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was also the first season on record (since 1851) to have two Category 4 hurricanes make continental U.S. landfall in the same year (Harvey and Irma), according to Klotzbach. Though the official end of the season is Thursday, December tropical storms and hurricanes, while rare, do occasionally occur. Since records began in 1851, only six hurricanes have been recorded after Nov. 30, NOAA said. As for preseason forecasts, NOAA said 2017 would see 5 to 9 Atlantic hurricanes (10 formed) while Colorado State predicted six. Meteorologist Steve Bowen of global reinsurance firm Aon Benfield said that “regardless of where the final seasonal totals end up from a financial standpoint, 2017 will long be remembered as one of the costliest and most devastating hurricane seasons ever experienced in this country. The hope is that the season will provide many learned lessons to improve awareness and risk mitigation for when the next big storm arrives.” ""If 2017 taught us anything, it’s that the question is never 'if' the United States will endure a significant hurricane event; it’s 'when' and 'where' the landfall will occur and 'how' we will be prepared,"" Bowen said.

The ex-Chicago Bulls star this week filed suit against Lindsay Glazer Woloshin and her husband Jacob Woloshin, saying they caused $110,000 in damages to the Hall of Famer's Fort Lauderdale mansion. The suit says the Woloshins rented the house last year after their home was damaged by Hurricane Irma, agreeing to pay $30,000 a month.

"AJ Willingham, CNN","(CNN) To those who follow the NFL, the monstrous defensive powerhouse known as J.J. Watt needs no introduction. The Houston Texans star is one of the biggest names in the NFL. He works out a lot. He has strategically uncontroversial views on things like the #TakeAKnee movement. Even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin, he has stepped up time and time again to support his adoptive home of Houston. In short, he's basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football. Watt was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and played college football in the area, but has spent his whole professional career with the Houston Texans, who signed him in the first round of the 2011 draft. (Translation: he's good, he's rich and his team loves him.) He's a defensive end, which means he is both massive and athletic. The only place you don't want to meet a man like J.J. Watt is on the wrong end of the football field. In 2014, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract extension with the Texans. (Again: good, rich, loved.) In the last few years, Watt has suffered several major injuries, including a groin tear, a herniated disk and a leg fracture that have kept him off the field for prolonged periods of time. Nonetheless, his injuries didn't stop him from using his wealth and influence to pursue some serious do-goodery. His Hurricane Harvey heroism After Hurricane Harvey devastated areas around Houston and the rest of the Gulf Coast in August 2017, Watt embarked on what would be his most career-defining charitable effort to date. Through a YouCaring campaign and plenty of social media attention and help from some famous friends, Watt raised more than $37 million for victims of the floods and damage Harvey left behind. Because of his fundraising, he was awarded the 2017 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, which is given to honor the charity and volunteer efforts of NFL players. His previous work with shooting victims Oddly -- and sadly -- enough, Watt's offer to the Santa Fe HS shooting victims' families isn't the first time he has reached out after such a tragedy. After the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, Watt invited some of the children from Sandy Hook Elementary to meet him and participate in a day of football and much-needed fun at the Texans' stadium. His charity work and social views In addition to his support in times of tragedy, J.J. Watt is also the founder of the (aptly-named) J.J. Watt Foundation. The foundation funds after-school athletics programs and organizations several high-profile charity events a year. Watt's reputation as an all-American good guy exists during a time when the NFL is facing questions about what it means to be an American and, indeed, what it means to be a good guy. Watt has managed to stay at the margins of such controversies. During the #TakeAKnee movement, which headlined much of the 2017 season and intersected with Watt's Hurricane Harvey fundraising, Watt had this to say : "" I think that I can speak to what I've seen recently in the last month or so and the incredible nature of people coming together and the unity people showed in the midst of Hurricane Harvey, in the midst of Hurricane Irma, everybody in Puerto Rico helping out. It's incredible to see what people do when they come together for a common cause."" In the spirit of those comments, it should be noted that while Watt is an extraordinary force for good in the NFL and in the Houston community, he is far from the only athlete -- in Texas and in pro sports -- who donates their time, talent and fortune to others. During the same 2017 hurricane season that brought Harvey's wrath to Houston, several MLB players from Puerto Rico raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help out their homeland, which was crippled by Hurricane Maria. And in another meaningful moment of unity and support after the Santa Fe shooting, Texans players Julién Davenport and Kendall Lamm joined members of the Houston Police Department for their Saturday night patrol. Watt's latest offer of comfort to the Santa Fe HS families has netted him widespread support from fellow celebrities and athletes, and echoes a sentiment he tweeted out just days before the shooting. ""If you have the power to make someone happy, do it,"" he wrote. ""The world needs more of that.""","The Houston Texans player is basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football.",2018-05-21T17:15:21Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",NFL star helping out the Santa Fe victims' families has a long history of philanthropy,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/jj-watt-who-is-texans-nfl-santa-fe-victims-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170829034158-j-j-watt-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Irma,1

Survivors of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 2017 California wildfires were put at risk.
Fema admitted the leak but said it had found no evidence that the improperly shared data was compromised.
Authorities said Fema shared participants' home addresses and bank account information with a third party contractor.
The survivors provided information to Fema in the course of applying for shelters. More than 20 data fields were improperly shared with the contractor, the Office of Inspector General said in a memo.
The name of the contractor was not made public.
Fema spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow said that the sensitive information had been removed from the system following a review.
""Since discovery of this issue, FEMA has taken aggressive measures to correct this error,"" Ms Litzow said. ""FEMA is no longer sharing unnecessary data with the contractor and has conducted a detailed review of the contractor's information system.""
Fema has previously been censured for mishandling information. A 2015 review by the same government watchdog found that survivor's records were stored at a disaster-response centre in California in open, unsecured cardboard boxes.
Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in August 2017, killing 68 people and causing about $125 billion (£95bn; 110bn) in damage. Hurricane Irma struck Florida later the same month, killing 97 and causing $50 billion in damage. Hurricane Maria killed more than 3,000 people in Puerto Rico and ravage the island.
The breach also included victims of the wildfires that swept through California in 2017, with 9,000 separate fires burning 1.2 million acres of land and killing at least 46 people.",Fema admits accidentally sharing 2.3 million people's addresses and bank details.,2019-03-23T05:11:43Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",US disaster relief agency exposed private data of 2.3m survivors,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47677722,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1234E/production/_106147547_mediaitem106147546.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Irma,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida Hurricane Michael has all but rubbed a Florida beach town off the map after landing like the ""mother of all bombs"". The storm smashed into the state's north-west coast near the community of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon packing 155mph (250km/h) winds. Over 1.4m homes had no power in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas on Friday morning. One of the most powerful hurricanes in US history, Michael has now killed at least 11 people. Rescuers are still searching for survivors. The storm, which fell just 2mph short of a top-level category five, ripped apart entire neighbourhoods, reducing properties to kindling and rubble. Michael's shrieking winds and surging seas knocked row after row of Mexico Beach beachfront homes from their foundations. Image copyright AFP Image caption US Coast Guard photo of Mexico Beach, Florida Gone with the wind By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach, Florida One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot sun and the debris: debris everywhere, tossed and scattered - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Much of the damage in Mexico Beach, Florida was caused by the over-100mph winds. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. Picking our way through a mass of rubble and detritus that was once a house, we spot an American flag on the ground; in amongst it all there is also a toy car and a cracked glass plate from a microwave. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. One weeping resident on CNN struggled to even find her street, let alone her home. Tom Bailey, the town's former mayor, told the New York Times: ""The mother of all bombs doesn't do any more damage than this."" The storm was so powerful that it snapped boats in two and knocked over 30-ton freight rail cars like toys. Some 285 people in Mexico Beach - population 1,000 - defied a mandatory evacuation order and stayed behind to ride out the storm. Linda Marquardt, 67, who hunkered down with her husband, told AP news agency: ""All of my furniture was floating. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in Mexico Beach, Florida walks past a home that was knocked from its foundation ""A river just started coming down the road. It was awful, and now there's just nothing left."" An insurance firm, Karen Clark &amp; Company, estimated Michael caused about $8bn (£6bn) in damage. By early Friday morning, the storm was about 65 miles (105km) northeast of Norfolk, Virginia, with winds of 60mph, said the US National Hurricane Center. Motorists had to be rescued on Thursday from cars trapped by high water in North Carolina, a state still reeling from last month's Hurricane Florence.

Police said there were five suspected tornados in Virginia. But it was Florida's Panhandle that bore the brunt of the tempest. Thousands of National Guard troops, police and rescue teams are converging on the area. US Army personnel have been using heavy equipment to clear away fallen trees so rescuers can reach any trapped residents. Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) crews are using dogs, drones and GPS in the search.

""We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,"" Stephanie Palmer, a Fema firefighter, told Reuters news agency. Flooding destroyed 1,000 homes in the small town of Port St Joe, not far from Mexico Beach. Mayor Bo Patterson said: ""We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they're on the other."" Image copyright Getty Images The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to reach 20,000 across five states by Friday, said the American Red Cross. The 11 known dead so far are one in North Carolina, one in Georgia, four in Florida and five in Virginia. A 38-year-old motorist in North Carolina was killed when a tree fell on his car on a highway east of Statesville. Eleven-year-old Sarah Radney, who was visiting her grandparents in Seminole County, Georgia, died when a metal carport near their home was lifted by powerful winds and then slammed through their roof. Four people were killed in Florida's Gadsden County in storm-related deaths. One of the dead there was identified by local officials as Steven Sweet, 44, who was killed when a tree fell on his home. On Friday, police in Virginia confirmed five deaths related to the storm. Among the dead in that state was James King,45, killed after his vehicle was caught in flash flood water in Pittsylvania County. The waters were too deep and swift for rescuers to reach him, officials say. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""

Charles Pulliam-Moore,"Even though the news cycle has moved on and shifted the focus away from Puerto Rico, the island is still struggling to recover from hurricanes Irma and Maria that ravaged the island, killed hundreds, and left over a million people without power. Though many have forgotten Puerto Rico, Lion Forge hasn’t. Next March, indie comics publisher Lion Forge is releasing Puerto Rico Strong, an anthology of comics from Puerto Rican creators meant to showcase their relationship and cultural connection to the island. In an official statement, Lion Forge expressed a desire to remind people that as foreign a place as it may seem to some, Puerto Rico is a part of the US and fellow American citizens should be invested in the island’s recovery: “What we hope to accomplish here is showcasing the vast diversity of Puerto Rico of our community and our history. There are those of us whose parents immigrated from the island, or who have family on the island still, or have never even seen Puerto Rico. We want to explore those stories of struggle and triumph through that lens.” Puerto Rico Strong boasts a solid roster of talent with stories from Vita Ayala, Naomi Franquiz, Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza, and many more. All profits from the anthology’s sale will be donated to humanitarian efforts throughout Puerto Rico.

Kevin Loria,"Without reefs to buffer some of the storm surge, Hurricane Irma's damage to Florida and the Caribbean would have been even worse. AP Photo/David Goldman On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma slammed into the Florida Keys, whipping islands with 130-mph winds and bringing surging ocean waters 4 to 6 feet higher than normal. The Category 4 storm reduced almost all ground-level homes to rubble in some parts of the Keys. Boats crashed onto roads and into trees, and cars were washed across streets. For some, returning to the Keys after the storm was impossible. About eight weeks after Irma hit, Erich Bartels, a scientist at Mote Marine Laboratory's coral research facility on Summerland Key, told Business Insider that the local community was ""just in shambles."" But without the coral reefs that line the coasts of the Keys, things would have been much worse, Bartels said — waves higher than 20 feet could have slammed the islands, wrecking even elevated homes. ""We lost a lot of our live coral out there. It basically gave its life so our buildings are still here,"" he said. Coral's function as a buffer is incredibly important for people all over the world, according to a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers applied models used by coastal engineers and insurance companies to calculate how much property damage coral reefs prevent each year. They found that without living reefs, flood damage around the world would double, increasing from $4 billion to $8 billion annually. Learning more about how reefs protect coasts has become urgent, since many experts think the majority of the world's coral reefs could die within decades. The Ocean Agency/XL Catlin Seaview Survey/Richard Vevers How coral reefs protect coasts Coral reefs are living structures that build up near coastlines, providing essential habitats for marine life. The reason they serve as buffers is that during storms, surging floodwaters and massive waves must roll through coral reefs before reaching land. When the water hits the breakwaters created by the reefs, it loses much of its energy. But around the world, about 50% of the world's reefs have died over the past 30 years. As humans have burned fossil fuels, the heat-trapping gases they emit have accumulated in the atmosphere, leading more heat to be trapped on the planet and Earth's average global temperature to rise. Earth's oceans have absorbed the majority of that heat — about 90% of it so far. As waters rapidly warm, corals lose the components that give them color and help them produce food, a process called bleaching. That slows their growth and makes them vulnerable to algae, disease, and death. Increased ocean acidification caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide causes this bleaching, too. Bleaching events killed about half of the largest reef system in the world, the Great Barrier Reef, since 2016. Worldwide, 98% of reefs are expected to be exposed to potentially fatal conditions every year by 2030. In some places, overfishing has also wiped out healthy food chains, which allowed algae and parasites to overwhelm corals. At other sites, boats dragging anchors and nets — or just scraping along the sea floor — have damaged or destroyed reefs as well. These creatures are also threatened by pollution from agriculture and runoff from cities. This global coral die-off means coasts will lose significant protection. The new study estimated that if just the top meter of reefs were lost, annual flood damage would double from $4 billion to $8 billion. Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico, and Cuba would all be hit with more than $400 million in additional flooding damage every year. The US would have to spend about $94 million more every year on flood damage. ""Unfortunately, we are already losing the height and complexity of shallow reefs around the world, so we are likely already seeing increases in flood damages along many tropical coastlines,"" Michael Beck, lead author of the new study and lead marine scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said in a statement. ""For the first time, we can now value what every national economy gains in flood savings by conserving its coral reefs every year."" According to the study, floods would affect about 70% more land and 81% more people every year without reefs. And of course, big storms would hit harder and cause more damage. The destruction from so-called ""100-year storms"" (which are now happening more than once every 100 years) would increase by about 90% according to these models. When combined with sea-level rise projections, that flood damage cost could quadruple. JonMilnes/Shutterstock Saving reefs The reasons to save reefs extend beyond coastal protection. These stunning sites, which cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, are some of the most biodiverse areas on Earth. About 25% of fish species spend some part of their life cycle in reefs, which means the loss of reefs could cause rippling ecosystem effects and more widespread ocean die-offs. Coral reefs also provide jobs for thousands who work in the fishing and tourism industries. Estimates of the overall economic value of reefs suggest they contribute between $30 billion and more than $375 billion to the world economy annually, though some scientists say those figures are far too low. For all of these reasons, scientists are trying to come up with ways to save reefs. Efforts include identifying coral that's particularly resilient to heat or acidity, and pioneering ways to quickly regrow coral so that dying reefs can be re-populated. Scientists involved in this work have achieved impressive results: in some cases they've recreated coral organisms that originally took a century or two to grow in just a few years. Other researchers are looking at ways to breed super-corals. On the Great Barrier Reef, researchers have been able to replant coral larvae in some sections after collecting coral eggs and sperm. Many experts think that with enough help, it's possible for reefs to recover in many places, at least to some degree. But if they are going to survive long-term, the global emissions causing climate change and ocean acidification need to dramatically reduced. Otherwise, we'll lose the protection, food, jobs, and pure enjoyment that reefs provide. ""It is our hope that this science will lead to action and greater stewardship of reefs around the world,"" Beck said.","Coral reefs provide essential protection for people who live near coasts all over the world, according to a recent study.

News Service of Florida,"U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who is close to Gov. Ron DeSantis: ""I can confirm that we asked Scott to stop making appointments weeks ago. He ignored us.""
TALLAHASSEE — Former Gov. Rick Scott exited the Tallahassee stage before Tuesday’s ceremonial inauguration of his successor was finished.
Scott had plans in the partially shut-down Washington, D.C. and wasn’t there to hear Gov. Ron DeSantis praise the economic foundation he received from Scott.
Scott left as reports about possible bad blood between the Scott and DeSantis camps emerged, partly fueled by Scott’s decisions during the final days of his administration to make dozens of appointments to courts, boards and commissions. The DeSantis camp made clear the new governor will rescind at least some of the Scott appointments.
""I can confirm that we asked Scott to stop making appointments weeks ago. He ignored us,"" U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who is close to DeSantis, said in a text message
For Scott, Tuesday’s plans included his own swearing-in as Florida’s junior U.S. senator.
Later, his political committee hosted a black-tie optional fundraiser at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, where attendees were encouraged to drop $10,000 to $100,000 — depending on the amount of access they wanted at the “Sunshine Ball.”
Since the November election, when Scott made a terse public statement outside the governor’s mansion about an election recount as he battled for the U.S. Senate seat, Scott was mostly absent from Tallahassee.
He took time to send letters to each of the legislative leaders he worked with: Florida Senate presidents Mike Haridopolos, Don Gaetz, Andy Gardiner and Joe Negron and House speakers Dean Cannon, Will Weatherford, Steve Crisafulli and Richard Corcoran. The letters outlined the state’s accomplishments, with a focus on the reduction of state debt by a third.
On Monday, Scott posted a photo of himself and his wife, Ann, inside the top of the tower of the Old Capitol, where he signed his name. Later, he hosted a party at the governor’s mansion, which delayed some of the new governor’s moving plans.
Scott also scrawled a letter — this time in blue Sharpie — on Rick Scott Governor letterhead stating, “Florida, Serving as your Governor has been the honor of a lifetime and the best job I have ever had. I will never stop fighting for you! Rick Scott.”
The handwritten letter, sent out of the governor’s office, was accompanied by 136 pages of actions undertaken by the state since Scott took office in 2011, including tax cuts, transportation funding, changes in education and health care, growth of the Florida Lottery and tourism, a reduced crime rate, increased support for the military and responses to hurricanes Irma, Maria and Michael.","Scott leaves inauguration early as reports of spat with DeSantis emerge The Ledger After nearly 70 years, Florida Clemency Board pardons Groveland Four Miami Herald Florida clemency board grants pardons to Groveland Four The Guardian Groveland Four granted pa…",2019-01-11T13:13:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theledger.com'}",Scott leaves inauguration early as reports of spat with DeSantis emerge - The Ledger,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190111/scott-leaves-inauguration-early-as-reports-of-spat-with-desantis-emerge,https://www.theledger.com/storyimage/LK/20190111/NEWS/190119452/AR/0/AR-190119452.jpg,,Theledger.com,Irma,1

Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google.

Delphine Schrank,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Seventy men, women and children poured through a U.S. port of entry early Friday to seek asylum, the largest single group yet accepted by U.S. officials from the caravan of Central American migrants that enraged President Donald Trump. Fleeing Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the migrants were among the last who had planned to ask for asylum, bringing the total to 228 who have crossed the border since last weekend. The nearly 400 migrants who reached Tijuana last week faced wrenching dilemmas about whether to enter the United States and request asylum, beginning an indefinite and complex process that could end in deportation. Many decided to stay in Mexico for now. After a month-long, 2,000-mile journey, their arrival at the border was hotly anticipated. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions beefed up legal resources on the border this week to handle people from the caravan. Trump had urged that the caravan to be detained and repeated his call for stronger border security Monday morning, writing on Twitter, “Our Southern Border is under siege.” The Trump administration said on Friday it will end temporary protections on Jan. 5, 2020 for up to 57,000 Honduran immigrants who arrived in the United States in the wake of Hurricane Mitch two decades ago. Temporary protection is different than the asylum status being claimed by members of the caravan. Just after 9 a.m., the migrants lined up to enter the long passageway between the countries. In single file, they walked straight through, mothers carrying teddy bears in one hand and small children in another. Among them was Irma Rivera, 31, with a son in her arms and a daughter prancing ahead. They had walked this route yesterday, led to the U.S. gate with a large group of migrants only to be turned back. As they reached a bend in the walkway on Friday, the view opened onto American soil and a large U.S. flag. “Where is the wall? I want to climb Trump’s wall,” said the boy, four years old. His mother laughed, tears glistening. There was no wall in sight, only a chance to join a long-lost brother in Texas and begin a new life. Her husband, a farmer, was killed late last year in El Salvador by a gang of farmers he had denounced for robbing his land, she said. In Mexico outside the port of entry, the remaining migrants were joined in a makeshift camp by other would-be asylum-seekers who had come seeking information and donations. Meanwhile, the caravan’s organizers scrambled to collect migrants’ names to track their dispersal across U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centers after they exit the port of entry’s detention facility in coming days.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system. Like clockwork, that’s what’s happening with Florence. And frankly, the discussion has never been more urgent thanks to climate change. After rapidly intensifying into a Category 4 beast, Florence slowly decayed until it landed in the Carolinas as a Category 1 storm. It was degraded further over the course of the weekend to a tropical storm and then a depression. All of these changes were based on one factor: How strong the maximum winds were. The idea that our sole way of defining hurricanes is by winds is supremely misguided. Some meteorologists hate it. Many people are confused by it. For storms that take a major human toll, it seems especially wrong-footed given that water is responsible for 90 percent of all deaths according to 2016 research. It’s like if Madden ratings where only based on a player’s ability to run (sorry Tom Brady). And with a storm like Florence, it’s easy to see why we need a new scale. The winds did a small portion of the damage while historic rainfall has created a flooding crisis that’s still unfolding. Storm surge—which was driven by Florence’s huge wind field and not just peak winds—further damaged the coast. Some people ignored evacuation orders because the storm was continually downgraded until landfall. Our current ranking system is literally putting people in danger. But that’s not even the worst part. Climate change is clearly intensifying the rainfall and surge associated with storms, making the Saffir Simpson scale even more out of synch with the hazards people living in hurricane zones face. The heaviest downpours are getting heavier thanks to climate change for a simple reason: A warmer atmosphere can hold more water. When that water falls out, look out below. The heavy rains from Florence and Harvey as well as what we saw recently with Lane in Hawaii exemplify that trend. In Harvey’s case, it was second-most costly hurricane on record with much of that rain falling over one of the largest cities in the U.S. Research published earlier this year indicates that hurricanes will get wetter still. Then there’s the storm surge part. Thanks again to climate change, oceans are rising. Seas have climbed about a foot since record keeping began. That gives storm surge a huge lift to inundate areas further inland. The costliest hurricane in U.S. history was Katrina (a Category 3 at landfall), which did most of its damage from storm surge. Ditto for Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) and Hurricane Irma (Category 3 at landfall in Florida), which are also among the five most destructive hurricanes. Like Florence, those storms has massive wind fields that also allowed them to stir up more of the ocean. And also like Florence, they got a lift from sea level rise. Sandy’s surge wouldn’t have done nearly as much damage to New York’s subway system, for example, if it weren’t for the extra sea level rise boost. Future storm surge will only be worse and it won’t take a Sandy-level storm to inundate New York. In fact, the only hurricane on the top five list that did beaucoup damage from wind is Maria. That speaks to a lot of things, notably the bad shape Puerto Rico’s grid was in and how slow the federal response was. That points to how we need to improve how and where we build, but it doesn’t alter the changing calculus of climate change and its influence on the storms themselves. Now look, the Saffir Simpson scale has a great back story. It came into existence in 1971 owing to the efforts of Herbert Saffir, a wind engineer, and Bob Simpson, the head of the National Hurricane Center. Their goal was the give the public a better sense of the risks hurricanes pose. And the scale originally focused on the impact of winds on cheap buildings like mobile homes. You could argue there’s a little bias since Saffir was a wind guy, but to be fair this was also progressive thinking given that it’s inevitably the poor that suffer the most from storms. But with climate change set to make poor people’s lives even worse (to say nothing of the rest of us as well), Saffir’s namesake scale needs to be redrawn. And we should do it soon so people get out of harm’s way before the pig shit hits the fan.","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Florence is proving to be a lumbering giant, crawling along the coastline as it dumps rain across the Carolinas. Anxiety is high in towns as far inland as Greenville, N.C., where residents braced for the one-two-punch of rain and storm surge. Read more about the expected floods here. • More than 4,500 people had checked into shelters in South Carolina, and the authorities said they had space for more than 34,000 across 64 shelters. North Carolina had opened 126 shelters for about 12,000 people, and is trying to open more. Here’s what it’s like inside. • We asked readers living in Florence’s projected path what they’re doing for the storm. Read about their experiences. • The Times is providing open and unlimited access to our coverage of Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut. Catch up on the rest of our coverage here. Government and military officials prepare to respond Brock Long, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday that the federal government had staged resources and personnel in states along the Eastern Seaboard to help quickly after the storm. Video FEMA workers were focused on helping the state and local authorities prepare, he said. But as the storm pushes through, the agency will shift its focus to identifying infrastructure damage and work to restore services. “The infrastructure is going to break. The power is going to go out,” Mr. Long said at a news conference. “We need people to get their mind-sets right that disasters are very frustrating and that it takes time to get the infrastructure back and running. We will move as quickly as we can to get back up.” The National Guard has readied about 4,000 soldiers and airmen, with more than 10 states mobilizing support. Air Force and Army helicopters were standing by for search-and-rescue operations and evacuations. A bad day for a wedding Hurricane season coincides with wedding season, which means a lot of cancellations and thwarted plans this week in the Carolinas. Some couples, like Leah Chesney and Brandon Frick, managed to move their ceremonies up, holding their beach wedding on the Outer Banks a few days earlier than planned. Deborah Sawyer, a veteran wedding planner and photographer in the Outer Banks, said that she always counsels couples considering a late-summer or early fall ceremony to get wedding insurance. Oceanfront homes used as event venues in the area generally offer renter’s insurance that covers storms. Carter Loetz and Esther Walsh were relieved that they got insurance. They live in Charlotte, N.C., and had been planning a 130-person wedding in Charleston, S.C., for a year. It was scheduled for Saturday. Now they’re considering new décor and outfits: Their new date is Nov. 30, and the summery garden party they had planned won’t quite work. They have also added a menu item. “We will definitely be serving hurricanes as the specialty cocktail,” Mr. Loetz said. Is this the last time we’ll get a Hurricane Florence? We’ll never see a Hurricane Harvey again. Or an Irma, Maria or Nate, for that matter. After last year’s hurricane season from hell, those four names were permanently scratched from the list that forecasters use to designate tropical cyclones. Hurricane Florence, if it meets expectations, looks as if it could be a slam dunk to join the list of retired names, which happens when the World Meteorological Organization judges that “a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity.” The current system for naming tropical cyclones has been around since 1979. Names for storms in the Atlantic are drawn from a different list than those for storms in the Eastern Pacific. The names are selected to be “familiar to the people in each region,” according to the meteorological organization. Read more here about how storms are named and retired.

Zahra Hirji,"Fog Creek Software, a small tech company based in New York, put in place a formal “climate leave” policy this fall that gives its employees time off to respond to extreme weather and other climate-linked disasters. Since Fog Creek shared the policy online earlier this month, the California-based Cylinder Digital has adopted it, and more companies are likely to follow. It’s not unusual for companies to give employees time off in the immediate wake of a disaster. But these companies have created a formal policy that workers can rely on as extreme weather and other events are projected to become more frequent and intense in a warming world. Under the policy, staff can take up to five days off a year to deal with the fallout of extreme weather, such as hurricanes and wildfires. And the leave can be extended if government officials formally declare an emergency. As the US government pulls away from climate policies, research, and planning, more and more companies are stepping up to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate impacts. At the global climate talks in Bonn last week, for example, Microsoft and Mars Inc. announced new emissions reduction goals. Fog Creek’s policy was enacted in October after one person at the company was displaced by Hurricane Irma in Florida and as others in northern California were on alert due to the fast spread of several damaging wildfires. Although headquartered in downtown Manhattan, Fog Creek’s staff of 36 people is spread across the US and the world. “Certainly, this summer into fall we had, like everybody, seen this series of storms just hitting and hitting and hitting,” Anil Dash, chief executive officer of Fog Creek, told BuzzFeed News. “We had people affected by Irma, in particular, either being displaced or in some cases taking people in who had been displaced. We had people in California that were watching the wildfires. This was all happening at the same time, and it made it very acute.” This wasn’t the company’s first brush with extreme weather, Dash said. Back in 2012, before he joined, the company’s data center in New York lost power during Superstorm Sandy. About a month after the company’s internal policy took effect, the federal government released a major report about how man-made climate change is playing out across the country, including a recent increase in large forest fires in the West. According to Dash, this report’s “dire” findings influenced his decision to publicly share the company’s policy in a Medium post earlier this month. Adarsh Pandit, the founder and sole employee of Cylinder Digital, has already adopted the policy. He sees it as a recruiting tool as he looks to grow his tech company in northern California. In the meantime, as he works with several contractors, he’s open to applying this policy to them in the event of a disaster. Five other companies from the tech industry have reached out to Fog Creek for more information, Dash said.",A software company in New York put in place the new policy after one worker was displaced by Hurricane Irma in Florida and others were threatened by wildfires in northern California. Other companies are starting to follow suit.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million United States citizens, the tax code treats the island as both a foreign and domestic entity. American affiliates in Puerto Rico get tax breaks like the ones granted to foreign companies, while the goods they produce are sold as made in America. The tax on intellectual property, which includes patents and design rights, would make Puerto Rico less attractive for business, compared with foreign countries that offer lower tax rates for manufacturers, said Ramón Ponte, president of the Puerto Rico C.P.A. society. “A lot of companies are going to look at the numbers and decide that, under the circumstances, it’s better to leave,” he said. “The issue is not Puerto Rico versus the mainland: It’s really Puerto Rico versus its competitiveness with other foreign jurisdictions.” If Republicans want to protect American jobs, as President Trump has pledged, then Congress should consider Puerto Rico a domestic entity, said Mr. Rosselló, who spent last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, making one last push for support. The governor predicted the tax plan would renew debate on the island about its commonwealth status. A vote on the tax bill could come as early as Monday or Tuesday. Mr. Rosselló accused Republican leaders — several of whom made highly publicized trips to Puerto Rico after Maria — of reneging on Congress’s commitment to help the island regain its financial footing. Photo Mylan, a mainland pharmaceutical company with operations in Puerto Rico, would be one of the businesses affected by the new tax. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times “Congress essentially turned its back on Puerto Rico, and essentially failed in its mission,” said Mr. Rosselló, a member of the island’s pro-statehood New Progressive Party who also identifies as a Democrat. “It’s just penalizing Puerto Rico. It’s putting Puerto Rico in a worse-off position than it was yesterday.” Last year, a special law — called Promesa, or “promise” in Spanish — was enacted to restructure Puerto Rico’s more than $70 billion debt. It established an eight-member, bipartisan task force that concluded in a December 2016 report that Congress needed to address the complex federal tax policy for Puerto Rico. The report underscored that jobs on the island and in other territories — including the United States Virgin Islands, which were also hammered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria — are American jobs. “The Task Force believes that Puerto Rico is too often relegated to an afterthought in congressional deliberations over federal business tax reform legislation,” lawmakers wrote. The group said it was “open” to giving tax incentives to American companies on the island as long as they were geared toward improving Puerto Rico’s economy and raising employment, as opposed to bolstering companies’ bottom lines. A 2012 Senate investigation found that Microsoft employed 177 workers on Puerto Rico, but reported some $4 billion in earnings there from profits channeled to the island to reduce the software giant’s tax burden. Microsoft sold brands and copyrights — that is, intellectual property — to its Puerto Rican affiliate to avoid paying higher mainland taxes. Among the task force’s recommendations that the final tax bill ignored: allowing lower-income Puerto Rican families with one or two children to qualify for an additional child-tax credit that currently kicks in only after a third child. Last month, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said lawmakers would address Puerto Rico’s tax concerns in negotiations with the Senate. “It is our intention to make improvements to our tax reform legislation as it relates to Puerto Rico when we go to conference,” Mr. Ryan said in a Nov. 16 statement issued jointly with Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member of Congress. Now, however, it appears Puerto Rico’s requests will have to wait until next year, when Congress could draft bills to extend tax credits or make technical corrections to the law. One of Ms. González-Colón’s suggestions, to create “opportunity zones” offering tax incentives for manufacturing, remains a possibility, said Representative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “I think more can be done as well, but I think this is important,” he said. “We are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild.” Still pending before Congress is Puerto Rico’s request for more than $94 billion in hurricane relief aid. The island continues to suffer deeply after Maria: Only 65 percent of its power generation has been restored. An exodus of Puerto Ricans has taken away workers crucial to reigniting the economy. More than 243,000 people have landed in Florida from the island since Oct. 3. Puerto Rico is sensitive to tax decisions made in Washington. In 1996, President Bill Clinton authorized the repeal of a 1976 provision that gave American companies significant tax incentives to establish their subsidiaries on the island. Those perks helped turn the island into a biotech manufacturing hub, but critics countered that most of the benefit went to wealthy investors, not local workers. Once the incentives were fully phased out in 2006, at a time when manufacturing was declining across the nation, Puerto Rico plunged into a recession that has lasted for more than a decade.

MICHAEL CORKERY,"But Walmart’s new digital initiative also highlights, albeit unwittingly, the financial struggles of Walmart’s low-wage work force. Even as the economy strengthens, many retail and service industry workers are not earning enough to make ends meet. “It sounds like this may be a useful service but it doesn’t tackle the fundamental problem Walmart workers suffer,” said Paul Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, an labor advocacy group. “Their paychecks are too small.” The app, which is called Even, also helps workers manage their finances by pinpointing exactly how much they can safely spend before their next paycheck. Walmart pays a fee on behalf of the workers to the technology firm that runs the app. The Even app has been used by other employers, but never on such a large scale as Walmart is using it. Ms. McKenna said employees who are less stressed about their financial stability “feel more confident and more settled at work.” The minimum starting wage at Walmart is $9 an hour, which is $1.75 higher than the federal minimum wage but lower than the starting wage at retailers like Costco, which pays $13 an hour, and Target, which recently raised its entry-level wage to $11 an hour. The average hourly wage for a full-time Walmart worker is $13.85, while the average hourly wage at Costco is about $24.50. Every Walmart employee can use Even’s financial planning tool, and obtain eight payments, known as instapays, per year free of charge. For most of the workers, the instapays will be deducted from their next paycheck. The workers can pay extra if they want more than eight instapays. Alexis Adderley, who works nights in a Walmart distribution center in Fort Pierce Fla., has started using the Even app as part of a pilot program. At first she was suspicious, she said, that the app was yet another in a long line of financial products like payday advances and “overdraft protection” that end up driving low-income workers deeper into a hole. But Ms. Adderley, the mother of four boys ages 8, 7, 4 and 2, said she had been pleasantly surprised. The app, which connects to her bank account, calculates how much she pays for housing, food and phone bills and tracks when she makes big monthly payments. With that data, Even provides Ms. Adderley a real-time estimate of how much she can spend in a given day. She earns $19.25 an hour, more than the average Walmart employee, and works 30 hours a week. But money is still tight, especially since she was forced to leave her home after Hurricane Irma. Earlier this week, the app warned Ms. Adderley, 30, that she had only enough money to safely spend $9.08 before her next paycheck. “I would love to save more,” she said. Walmart executives said they learned about Even after reading a New York Times article about the firm a few years ago. The retailer is also working with another tech firm, PayActiv, which facilitates some of the payments. These partnerships reflects Walmart’s broader effort to make inroads in Silicon Valley, where the old-line retailer is seeking to acquire talent and ideas to boost its digital heft in its battle with Amazon. Before creating Even, one of the firm’s co-founders, Jon Schlossberg, had developed an app called Knock, which allows phone users to unlock a phone by knocking on it. Idealistic and flush with money from the success of Knock, Mr. Schlossberg said he began studying how a cash shortage affects people’s physical and mental well-being. “It is a fundamental problem with the capitalistic society,” Mr. Schlossberg said in an interview. Mr. Schlossberg, 30, said he set out to create a product that could reduce the stress associated with financial strain, joining a crowd of other so-called fintech start-ups seeking to disrupt the traditional banking model. Landing a deal with such a large employer was a watershed moment for Even and PayActiv. Walmart pays a small fee to Even to allow workers to withdraw their wages ahead of payday. Workers can take out only a portion of wages that they have already earned during the two-week pay cycle — so technically, Even says, these are not loans. “You have earned this money,” said Safwan Shah, founder of PayActiv. “Who decides you should get paid every two weeks?” Labor groups say the best investment Walmart could make is not in a new app, but in increasing wages. “All of these solutions to help people live paycheck to paycheck puts the burden on the worker, not the employer,’’ said Carrie Gleason, who works on issues affecting retail and other low-wage workers at the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group. Walmart and the fintech firms say cash flow issues are not just a problem for the poor, but affect a broad segment of Americans. Ms. McKenna said Walmart was making a “reasonably substantial investment” in paying for the Even service for its employees. The company raised starting wages nearly three years ago, and Ms. McKenna pointed out that Walmart has also increased employee training programs that aim to advance workers into management, where they can earn more. “We continue to look at investing in our associates,” Ms. McKenna said.

Chelsea Gohd,"NASA is surveying the damage to Puerto Rico's forests after the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Category 5 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017 very shortly after Hurricane Irma, another Category 5 hurricane, hit the island. This caused severe damage and casualties from which the island's residents are still working to recover. A new flyover survey, described in a video from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, shows how Puerto Rico's lush forests were impacted by the hurricane. From the belly of a small plane, NASA flew an instrument called Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal (G-LiHTs) airborne imager over Puerto Rico's forests. G-LiHT collected high-resolution photographs, surface temperatures and information about the height and structure of vegetation on the ground. The team had previously flown G-LiHT over Puerto Rico months before Hurricane Maria hit, so a pretty clear picture of the damage that the hurricane caused is obtained from comparing the two data sets. A NASA survey shows how Puerto Rico's forests were impacted by the two category 5 Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma. This image is how the forests ""look"" through G-LiHT, the airborne instrument scientists are using to complete this survey. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Matthew Radcliffe ""In many ways, Hurricane Maria has reset patches of forest across the island,"" Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the video. Morton added that ""canopy trees normally have a large and sometimes circular crown, allowing them to spread their leaves, photosynthesize and live in the top of [the] canopy. Hurricane Maria came through and ripped off many of those large branches, leaving individuals standing almost like an individual stem."" Hurricane Maria had wind speeds topping out at 175 miles per hour and rains that pummeled towns and wreaked havoc on the island's power grid, so forest damage is no surprise. But, as Morton describes in the video, these trees will recover with time. ""They'll have to regrow those leaves or give up that space in the canopy to their neighbors as they regrow,"" Morton said. In the video, Morton shows how one tree knocked down its neighbors, which will allow sunlight to reach the forest floor and help new, young plant life to grow. He also points out that large trees, stripped of their large branches, will likely recover their leaves and branches with time. Email Chelsea Gohd at cgohd@space.com or follow her @chelsea_gohd.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","The Gainesville Police Department’s Facebook page has been gaining a ton of attention after the department posted a selfie of some of their officers helping with the recovery efforts, and the internet can’t get enough of their smiles. USA TODAY Ex-Gainesville Police Department officer Michael Hamill, center, poses in the ""hot cop"" photo that went viral in September. Hamill has since resigned following allegations he made anti-Semitic Facebook posts and had sex with a woman while on duty. (Photo: Gainesville, Fla., Police Department) A Gainesville, Florida, police officer who gained unexpected fame as one of the ""hot cops"" responding to Hurricane Irma has resigned from the department amid allegations he made anti-Semitic Facebook posts and had sex with a woman while on duty. Gainesville Police Department Officer Michael Hamill had been suspended in September following the Facebook allegations. He resigned Dec. 6, the day he was to be interviewed in an Internal Affairs investigation. Department spokesman Ben Tobias said both allegations would have been sustained based on evidence. It is possible Hamill, who was hired in 2016, would have been terminated as a result. In early September, the department posted a selfie of Hamill and two other GPD officers ""getting ready to do some work"" as Hurricane Irma swept through Florida. The post of the ""hot cops"" drew thousands of admirers and many departments across the country followed suit by posting their own photos of studly officers. Read more: Florida 'hot cop' suspended after anti-Semitic Facebook posts surface But just weeks after the Sept. 10 post, the department received complaints about the Facebook posts and a sexual relationship he had with a woman. Investigators uncovered two posts Hamill had made to his personal Facebook account before he was on the Gainesville police force. In one from 2011, he says, ""Stupid people annoy me,"" then added, ""put them in an oven and deal with them the hitler way. Haha."" He posted that ""reading Jewish jokes"" helped him feel better about himself in a 2014 post. He then offered the following: ""What's the difference between boy scouts and Jews?... Boy scouts come back from their camps."" Read more: Photos of officers responding to Irma go viral, draw appreciation The department said the ""offensive nature"" of the posts affected Hamill's ability to interact with the community. Department investigators also found Hamill had sex with a woman while he was on duty, using interviews, GPS readings and text messages. The woman told investigators the on-duty visits stopped after she found out Hamill was married, which occurred after the ""hot cops"" post went viral. Tobias, in an email, said the department takes officer misconduct ""extremely seriously."" The department requires all of its recruits to visit the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, before being sworn. He said the incident involving Hamill was ""not solely"" the reason for the tours, adding the department had been in contact with the museum before the incident.

Haley Samsel,"It's no secret that we've had a rough fall and winter with natural disasters. Even as we write this, fires burn in Southern California, adding to the previous wildfires in the northern part of the state that burned over 245,000 acres in October. Hurricanes Irma and Harvey devastated communities across Florida and Texas, while touching communities in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Louisiana. The U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were devastated by back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria. Amidst the trauma and destruction, school districts across the U.S. have shouldered a heavy burden: trying to help their students catch up after missing days, weeks and even months of class time. Across nine states, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, at least 9 million students missed some amount of school this fall due to a natural disaster, according to an NPR Ed analysis. The analysis compiled missed days from individual public school districts affected by natural disasters as well as estimates given by state education departments. In Florida, 2.6 million kids missed at least one full week of school, according to our analysis. Overall, the state's students missed an average of 5.78 days. About 2 million students in Texas also missed at least one school day. The hardest hit? School districts near Corpus Christi, a coastal city on the Gulf of Mexico. Some students there were out for several weeks. Elsewhere: Aransas Pass, a Texas district serving about 1,800 students, didn't re-open until Oct. 16; that's 34 days after schools were originally closed. Compare that with Houston, where schools reopened 10 days after Harvey. In Southern California, many schools near Santa Barbara have been closed for the last two weeks, with plans to reopen after the new year. And those numbers pale in comparison to Puerto Rico. An estimated 345,000 students on the island were affected by the disaster, missing several weeks of school. Many students have left to live with relatives and attend school in the states, particularly Florida and New York. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, where roughly 13,000 students missed weeks of classes, most schools are now open, with the exception of a few that have been ""condemned"" by the islands' education department. All this lost time, of course, is likely to have an impact on student achievement. A fairly new metric in education, chronic absence, is defined as missing more than 10 percent of the school year — just two days a month. Lots of research has shown that such students are way more likely to fall behind and, eventually, drop out. Especially for those in early grades, where the emphasis in school is placed on learning to read. After third grade, students are expected to read to learn, but if the foundations aren't there, they can struggle. Under the new federal education law, 36 states plan to use some measure of chronic absence to measure school success. And while missing school from a disaster is not the same as chronic absence — after all, all the students are absent from school, the hit on learning time is vast. In the aftermath of these disruptions, some districts are taking creative measures to make up for missed class time. The Manatee County schools in Florida, with almost 49,000 students, added 10 minutes to every school day from Oct. 2 to Dec. 20, along with a shortened Thanksgiving break. Many districts say they have enough class time built into their calendar that the missed days won't keep them from meeting requirements. In other places, though, the time lost is just too much to make up. In Texas and Florida, state education commissioners have waived several required days due to the extreme nature of the disasters. In Texas, those lost days — or weeks — have worried educators in several districts, who are asking the state to delay testing dates or suspend testing requirements altogether. As it stands, Texas' fifth- and eighth-graders, as well as high school students, must pass state tests to advance to the next grade or graduate. Most superintendents of districts affected by Harvey say they do not want to delay state tests in the spring, but they're worried that the state will evaluate their districts harshly due to low test scores. ""We don't mind taking the exams, but we don't want to be... publicly humiliated over something we had no control over,"" Joseph Patek III, superintendent of the hard-hit Aransas County school district, said during a state legislature meeting on Nov. 14. Districts across the country could be grappling with this same spring testing issue, when missed class time catches up with students and teachers still dealing with the trauma wrought by natural disasters. For now, in Texas, the state education agency says it will take into account how many students and staff were displaced and how classrooms were disrupted when deciding on accountability.","Wildfires, hurricanes, flooding — this fall has brought a wave of natural disasters to the U.S. With that comes many days where schools are closed — and those absences add up.",2017-12-15T10:49:06Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Natural Disasters And The Implications Of Missing So Much School,https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/12/15/564058043/natural-disasters-and-the-implications-of-missing-so-much-school,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/12/01/disasters_wide-cdff79d31e52349d887e4b3c8e8ccd21be949179.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Irma,1

Same-store sales came in at up 7.9% year-over-year, ahead of the up 5.9% that Wall Street was expecting. The company raised its full-year forecasts. (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc, the largest U.S. home improvement chain, beat analysts' quarterly profit and sales estimates, as hurricanes Harvey and Irma boosted demand for emergency products and rebuilding materials. The Dow component's shares, already up 23 percent this year, were about 1 percent higher in premarket trading on Tuesday. Home improvement retailers benefit from the sale of emergency storm-related merchandise such as generators, batteries and flashlights during hurricanes as well as from demand for rebuilding materials in the aftermath. Home Depot, which again raised its full-year forecasts, said hurricane-related sales added about $282 million to comparable sales in the third quarter. Sales at home improvement retailers have also been boosted by the multi-year recovery in the U.S. housing market, which has been supported by steadily rising wages and low unemployment rates. Sales at Home Depot's stores open for more than a year rose 7.9 percent, above the average analyst estimate of 5.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comparable sales at U.S. stores increased 7.7 percent, beating the average analyst estimate of 6 percent. Home Depot's net income rose to $2.17 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the third quarter ended Oct. 29, from $1.97 billion, or $1.60 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 8 percent to $25.03 billion, helped by a 5 percent jump in average ticket and as customer transactions rose 2.5 percent. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $24.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot raised its forecasts for the year ending January 2018, citing strength in the housing market and projected hurricane-recovery sales. The company said it now expects sales to grow 6.3 percent and comparable sales increase of 6.5 percent. The company had previously forecast sales growth of 5.3 percent and comparable sales to increase 5.5 percent.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole. That’s according to a study published online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a tricky one. We know that, generally, storms are more intense when the air is warmer, and their impacts on coastlines are more severe when the sea level is higher. But determining whether the odds of a single storm were affected by the warming climate is a science all unto itself. It’s called weather attribution. “We believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Many researchers weren’t sure what to initially think about Harvey when it struck the Gulf in August. Nearly three months later, at least one scientist is offering some answers as to how much climate change impacted the odds of the hurricane that left at least 82 dead and damaged more than 119,000 homes in Harris County, Texas—and how much it’ll continue to boost those odds in the future. Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric science professor at MIT who authored the paper, found that record rainfall—like the 27 trillion gallons of water we saw with Harvey—will become 18 percent more likely to hit the state by the end of the century under a business-as-usual, worst-case-scenario emissions model, which Emanuel uses in the study. Between 1981 and 2000, those chances were slim: 1 percent for a given year. When looking at Houston, specifically, he found that storms like Harvey have historically happened once every 2,000 years, describing it as “biblical,” in a press release. Climate change is changing all that. It already is: Emanuel estimates that, in 2017, those 1 percent odds have increased to 6 percent. “You’re rolling the dice every year,” said Emanuel, in the press release. “And we believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Most climate models available to scientists like Emanuel are too coarse in resolution to simulate the formation of hurricanes. But Emanuel and his team developed one that can model hurricanes at high spatial resolutions within a changing climate. At least one other scientist, atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach, at Colorado State University, knows and trusts this approach. He’s seen this model used in previous research by Emanuel, and “it seems to work fairly well at replicating overall Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach wrote in an email to Earther. “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” But we also know that Texas saw some unique conditions with Harvey that made the storm’s impacts so much worse. For one, Houston didn’t build with storms in mind. Its sprawling development and vast impervious surfaces allowed water to just pool in the city and create flooding like no one ( well, except these journalists ) expected. Then, there were the meteorological conditions surrounding the storm itself. Atmospheric steering currents, which would usually bring a storm like Harvey inland to die, were unusually weak, so the hurricane stayed close to shore picking up more and more water from the Gulf with which to pound Texas. That’s where Klotzbach has some questions: “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” he asked, in the email to Earther. Emanuel ponders this, too, in his study. Still, in an email to Earther, he emphasized his confidence in his methods, which account for both storm movement and changing atmospheric moisture. And this study isn’t the last one coming. He and his team are analyzing how much of the state’s projected rainfall increases will result from either changing atmospheric moisture levels or longer-lasting events. “Preliminary results show roughly equal contributions from both factors,” he wrote to Earther. Emanuel does know some things for certain, though. And he makes note in his study: [A]nthropogenic climate change is expected to lead to a greater incidence of high-intensity hurricanes, which together with rising sea level, will produce increased risk of storm surge flooding, while hurricanes are projected to produce substantially more precipitation as the atmosphere and oceans warm. While it’s difficult to say climate change caused any one storm, we can safely assume climate change will bring about more storms like Harvey, or Irma, or Maria. Research like Emanuel’s gives us a sense of how much more likely these storms will be in the future. And that information will help us prepare.","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole.

Jenna Amatulli,"A list of songs purporting to be those most banned by couples at weddings has been recirculating online this week, and it is truly appalling. Why? Because the list, cobbled together by FiveThirtyEight in 2017, includes every incredible song with choreographed moves! We’re talking “Chicken Dance,” “Macarena,” “Cha-Cha Slide” ― and those are only the top three, respectively. Others in the top 10 include “YMCA,” “Electric Boogie (Electric Slide),” AND “Hokey Pokey.” What is this aversion to organized dance?! Why do people abhor happiness so much? The full list follows: Here are the songs that couples most frequently ban from wedding receptions: https://t.co/TBbpGnHro0 pic.twitter.com/QPBQuhcuZF — FiveThirtyEight (@FiveThirtyEight) July 21, 2018 The FiveThirtyEight folks said they spoke to more than two dozen professional DJs who had worked nearly 200 weddings to discover the songs “most commonly prohibited” by the people getting married. So this isn’t exactly a scientific survey, but more like: “Yeah, we chatted up a bunch of dudes who have worked a ton of bat mitzvahs and they had this to say.” Regardless of that, if we take the report at face value, it indicates that the DJs polled wrestled with what to do with some of these songs. Some banned them because of their “banality.” Others, however, played them “because they are fun and work on dance floors.” Obviously, that latter belief is the only viable one. Dancing is fun, you guys. Why ban a song just because it’s not “original”??? Seeing your old aunt Irma doing the “Chicken Dance” is honestly one of the last vestiges of pure joy left in this world, so why not savor it? At any rate, the list is recirculating because nothing on the internet never dies which leads us to believe that these songs will never die, no matter how much they are banned.

"USA TODAY, Joel Shannon, USA TODAY","The coastal surge from Hurricane Maria reached up to 5 feet or more devastating the town of Toa Baja in Puerto Rico which can be seen in the water lines on homes Oct. 1, 2017. In addition to flooding many homes also lost their roofs leaving many people exposed to the elements or forcing them to abandoned their homes. (Photo: Ricky Flores, Carrie Cochran, USA TODAY NETWORK) The Federal Emergency Management Agency admitted Thursday that it drastically underestimated the devastation that Hurricane Maria was about to unleash on Puerto Rico in 2017, hampering the agency's ability to react to the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. The findings are in FEMA’s after-action report summarizing the agency’s performance in 2017, a busy year that featured three catastrophic hurricanes. It follows widespread criticism of the agency's handling of the 2017 hurricane season, particularly its response to hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, knocking out power to virtually the entire U.S. territory of more than 3 million people. The report says FEMA's planning in the region was incomplete, did not adequately account for the possibility of multiple major disasters in a short amount of time, and underestimated the impact of ""insufficiently maintained infrastructure"" in Puerto Rico. “FEMA leadership acknowledged that the Agency could have better anticipated that the severity of hurricanes Irma and Maria would cause long-term, significant damage to the territories’ infrastructure,” the report says. “Leadership also recognized that emergency managers at all levels could have better leveraged existing information to proactively plan for and address such challenges, both before and immediately after the hurricanes.” A May 2018 Harvard study estimated that over 4,000 deaths were associated with the storm, contradicting an official estimate of 64. FEMA's Thursday report said the fatality estimate was being reviewed by the government of Puerto Rico. The report says that it had committed to updating a portion of its Caribbean Response Plan before the 2017 Hurricane Season, but went into the season with an incomplete plan. The agency developed that portion of the plan during response operations, the report says. Existing plans also did not adequately account for the possibility of multiple major incidents happening in rapid succession. For example, the plan assumed that at least one support base in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands would survive the impact of a major hurricane. But Hurricanes Irma and Maria affected both bases. FEMA's report cited challenges unique to Puerto Rico, hinting at a conflict that at times played out publicly. Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, criticized the Trump administration's response in Puerto Rico and publicly confronted FEMA at a news conference, saying the lack of better assistance could be described as genocide. The report says that FEMA's planning counted on state and territory government officials to meet their responsibilities. ""Due to a lack of communications or other capability shortfalls,"" the report says that those responsibilities were not met. That was, in part, because many first responders could also be considered survivors of the incident — a uniquely challenging situation said Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the office of response and recovery. The report says FEMA did not anticipate the cash flow problems the local government had. Byard called 2017 a “transformational year” for the agency, which faced continuing staffing issues. He said the agency strives to continually improve and said Thursday's report is an important part of that process.

RICK ROJAS,"“The minute we got into the law school, we knew there was a very minimal amount of jobs we could acquire as lawyers working in a firm there already,” said Lourdes Carreras-Ortiz, a University of Puerto Rico law student. But before the storm, Ms. Alers-Ortiz said, many Puerto Ricans were able to maintain at least the facade of a middle-class life: They had cellphones, went to the movies, shopped for clothes at Plaza Las Américas, a sprawling mall in San Juan. The storm washed that away. “Our first-world mask has been ripped off,” she said. “Now, we’re third world.” “The feeling is life stopped,” she added. Members of the diaspora, even recent arrivals, argue that they can contribute to Puerto Rico’s recovery from afar. They point to a surge of money and supplies, and they said they can push elected officials to direct more aid to the island. A report published by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College projected that upward of 200,000 people could leave the island in the year after the hurricane, and that by 2019, that figure could approach a half-million people, or about 14 percent of the island’s population. Researchers anticipate the demographic shifts created by migration will spread beyond Florida and the New York metropolitan area, places that already have longstanding ties to the island, to communities across the country. Aja Nelson had been displaced twice: She fled St. Thomas, one of the United States Virgin Islands, for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, only to be pushed out again by Maria. Now, Ms. Nelson is staying with relatives in Atlanta. “I am just shell shocked,” she said. Jose Manuel Ureña, 24, had been a cook for the last two years at a restaurant in Condado, an upscale area of San Juan that had been popular with tourists, and also helped his brother take care of their mother. He said he had lost his job and a friend promised to help him find work in a kitchen in Newark, where he was heading. “My plan is to get to New Jersey and work until I can’t anymore,” he said. “I can’t wait to have a home again.” Many who left Puerto Rico described an existence that had been stripped down to its basics, their days spent collecting food, water and fuel. When Mr. Franceschini arrived in New York, he began to notice the trivial things he had once taken for granted, like when he had a cool drink. “You’re really excited over ice,” he said. Touro Law Center is one of many schools across the country that have welcomed displaced students. A small group had come just for the semester and expected to return to their school next year, but now they realize their time away is likely not enough to restore living conditions to what they were before the storm. “The Puerto Rican way of life is gone as we know it,” Mr. Camacho-Vazquez said. “This is a fact.” The grim situation on the island has forced the students, who are mostly in their third year of law school, to reassess their plans after they graduate and whatever obligation they have to Puerto Rico. “I don’t owe the government anything, but I do owe my island something,” Ms. Carreras-Ortiz said as she sat with her classmates on campus one recent afternoon. “I lived there.

Joel Langstein,"Residents along the U.S. Gulf Coast were recently met with an unlikely sight. Dust from the Sahara Desert in Africa recently reached as far west as Houston, Texas, denying hurricanes the moisture or fuel they need to develop. The dust contributes to a dry, sinking air mass that suppresses thunderstorms and makes it hard for hurricanes to intensify, senior scientist Chris Davis told Bloomberg. Davis is also associate director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Saharan dust generally travels between 5,000 to 20,000 feet in the atmosphere, according to NOAA. The agency adds that the dust reaches Florida and the Gulf Coast when winds pushing the dust are stronger than normal. HURRICANE IRMA: THE SCIENCE OF THE DEADLY STORM Known as the Saharan Air Layer, the dust also helps restore nutrients in the Amazon rain forest as it sprinkles onto soil that is frequently hit by flooding rains, according to NOAA. Peak hurricane season in the Atlantic basin is from mid-August to late October. Many hurricanes that affect the U.S. mainland originate from Western Africa as tropical waves. Although Saharan dust is a big obstable for tropical development, storms can still form in the adverse conditions. As of this morning, Tropical storm Chris is stationary off the North Carolina coast. While Chris is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, the current forecast track from the National Hurricane Center has the storm remaining offshore. Joel Langstein is a Fox News College Associate.

Dara Kerr,"Tourists can now book experiences in Puerto Rico where they can see the sights and also learn about the local culture. Airbnb Airbnb has a message: Puerto Rico is open for business. The home-rental company said Wednesday that it's expanding its partnership efforts with the island to help it promote tourism. Airbnb said the idea is to assist the country in continuing reconstruction after last September's devastation from Hurricane Maria. Along with donating to local recovery organizations all fees from its bookings in the country over the next three months, Airbnb is launching 50 new experiences throughout Puerto Rico. With experiences, visitors can book local tours, like sailing in San Juan Bay at sunset and hiking in a local nature preserve. ""It's important to encourage people to continue to visit Puerto Rico,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said during a press event at the company's San Francisco headquarters. ""This is a superpower that Airbnb has."" Hurricane Maria is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Puerto Rico. It's winds of up to 175 mph caused floods and devastation that the country is still reeling from. In March, six months after the hurricane, 11 percent of Puerto Rico still didn't have electricity, according to NPR. ""It's no secret that we've been hit hard by the hurricane,"" Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, said at Airbnb's press event. ""This year was a tough year for us."" When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, Airbnb activated its disaster response tool. The way the tool works is the company contacts people in a disaster area asking if they have a room or couch they'd like to offer for free. Respondents can list their space on the company's disaster response portal, which those in need can use to find a place to stay. Though Airbnb typically aims to make a profit off its home rentals, the company is increasingly offering free services to people in need. It created a disaster response tool in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which left more than 100,000 people homeless in the New York City area in 2012. More recently, Airbnb offered places to stay to immigrants who were stranded by President Donald Trump's travel ban and people affected by hurricanes Irma and Harvey. So far, Airbnb has offered its response tool in connection with 100 disasters around the world, Chesky said. Along with donating booking fees, and the 50 new experiences in Puerto Rico, Airbnb also announced Wednesday the launch of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. This joint initiative with the country aims to promote sustainable tourism on the island and encourage visitors to travel to Puerto Rico. ""It's critical that we get tourism back up to normal,"" Rossello said. ""Now, because of the storm, people are aware that there is this small island that has something to offer.""

The duo’s wry opening song, “What Even Is Americana,” attempted to explain the amorphous genre to any newcomers in the audience. “A folk song with no discernible chorus … an R&amp;B cover with pedal steel on it, I guess that’s Americana,” they sang, to laughter, then added a spoiler for the night ahead: “Don’t need to see the envelope, Isbell won it.” Jason Isbell and his band The 400 Unit took home three trophies: album (for 2017's tour de force “The Nashville Sound,” produced by Dave Cobb), song (for Isbell’s “If We Were Vampires”) and duo/group of the year. It's the first time he and the 400 Unit have won duo/group honors, but it was Isbell’s fourth song of the year win and third album of the year.

JULIA JACOBO,"The Cajun Navy is sending volunteers to the Carolinas to help with rescues after Hurricane Florence brings torrential rainfall, record-breaking flooding and severe storm surge to the East Coast. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The organization is expected to have 120 to 200 boats on the ground in affected areas by Thursday afternoon, Todd Terrell, the founder and president of the Louisiana Cajun Navy, told ABC News. The volunteers are converging onto Gaston, South Carolina, about 150 miles west of Myrtle Beach, Terrell said. Some members of the volunteer group are traveling more than 18 hours from Texas to North and South Carolina to provide resources and more manpower to first responders. Taylor Fontenot, a roofer in Sugar Land, Texas -- southwest of Houston -- joined America's Cajun Navy last year after Hurricane Harvey hit the Lone Star state in August 2017, he told ABC Houston station KTRK. ""I went out there that first night, and going out and saving people saved my life,"" he said of Harvey's impact on the Houston area. The Cajun Navy provided volunteers for Hurricanes Harvey in Houston, as well as Hurricane Irma in the Florida Keys and Hurricane Marine in Puerto Rico, during the 2017 season. The Cajun Navy did 35,000 rescues in just 10 days amid catastrophic flooding in Houston, Fontenot said, adding that the excitement from it all fuels his will to serve. ""Adrenaline, I found out, is a hell of a drug,"" he said. He also traveled to the Florida Keys after Hurricane Irma ravaged the islands in September 2017, and in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit just weeks later. In Puerto Rico, members of the Cajun Navy distributed more than 300,000 meals, Fontenot said. On Wednesday, Fontenot packed up diving gear, a rappelling harness, first aid supplies, a chainsaw and Houston Texans football cleats to bring with him to the Carolinas, he said. Texas resident Taylor Fontenot, a member of the Cajun Navy, is driving 18 hours to the Carolinas to help with efforts for Hurricane Florence. The organization is relying on volunteers' hours and donated cash for gas while it combats the effects of Florence, KTRK reported. The volunteers hope to keep the hurricane a ""zero-casualty event,"" Fontenot said.

Elizabeth Zwirz,"President Trump on Tuesday touted what he described as the “incredibly successful” response to the back-to-back hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico last year. The president’s remarks came in the midst of an update in the Oval Office with officials on the status of Hurricane Florence, currently making its way towards the East Coast. “I think Puerto Rico was incredibly successful,” Trump said, adding that he thought the storms that hit the island were “probably the hardest” thus far due to “the island nature.” “The job that FEMA and law enforcement and everybody did, working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,” Trump said. “Texas we have been given A-pluses for. Florida we’ve been given A-pluses for. I think in a certain way the best job we did was Puerto Rico but nobody would understand that, I mean it’s harder to understand.” President Trump listens as FEMA Administrator Brock Long, center, talks about Hurricane Florence in the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, right. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) HURRICANE FLORENCE’S PATH: TRACK THE STORM HERE Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the island in September 2017, the latter of which had its official death toll increased last month from 64 people dead to 2,975. The updated number came via an independent investigation ordered by the local government, prompting Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello to raise the official total. The Trump administration's efforts in Puerto Rico received widespread criticism. But after visiting the island last September, the president said that Puerto Ricans were fortunate that the storm did not yield a catastrophe akin to the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast in 2005. In response to the president’s comments, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello issued a statement Tuesday on “the worst natural disaster in our modern history.” (AP) In response to the president’s comments, Rossello issued a statement Tuesday on “the worst natural disaster in our modern history.” “No relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called ‘successful’ because Puerto Ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow Americans in the states. The historical relationship between Puerto Rico and Washington is unfair and unAmerican. It is certainly not a successful relationship,” Rossello said. “This was the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle,” the statement continued. “Now is not the time to pass judgement; it is time to channel every effort to improve the lives of over 3 million Americans in Puerto Rico.” PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR RAISES HURRICANE MARIA DEATH TOLL FROM 64 TO 2,975 Several Democratic lawmakers came out against the president’s words on Tuesday, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who tweeted that “Americans expect their presidents to own up to their failures” and that Trump “must stop trying to deny that tragedy &amp; take steps to save lives in the future.” House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., released a statement calling for the president to apologize. “President Trump’s characterization of his administration’s botched response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria as ‘incredibly successful’ and ‘one of the best jobs that’s ever been done’ is offensive to the families of the nearly 3,000 Americans who were killed and the countless more who suffered for months without power or running water,” Hoyer said in a statement. “He ought to apologize, and Congress ought to investigate what went wrong with the Trump Administration’s response and identify steps to ensure it does not happen again.” “With another storm now threatening our country, I pray that the President and his team are not taking the same approach they did last year in preparing to meet this challenge,” the statement continued. With the pending arrival of Hurricane Florence, Trump on Tuesday vowed that “the safety of the American people is my absolute highest priority” and that the government was “totally prepared” and would be “sparing no expense” in response efforts.

Reuters,"Cuban President Raul Castro, left, with First Vice President Miguel Diaz Canel during a session of the National Assembly in Havana, December 20, 2014. Thomson Reuters HAVANA (Reuters) - Miguel Diaz-Canel was proposed in Cuba's parliament on Wednesday as the sole candidate to replace Raul Castro as president, which will make him the island's first non-Castro leader since the 1959 revolution. Castro, 86, is stepping down after 10 years in office. The National Assembly was due to vote later in the day on the proposal to replace him with Diaz-Canel, a 57-year-old engineer who is currently first vice president. Diaz-Canel, born after the revolution, embraces technology and appears socially liberal. Also a stalwart of the ruling Communist Party, he is considered a safe bet to inherit the ideological mantle of Castro and other elderly leaders who helped Fidel Castro oust US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The new president is likely to be cautious at first, seeking to consolidate support among conservatives despite desire among young Cubans for faster development. He is unlikely to challenge one-party rule.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini While this week's assembly is promoting younger leaders of government, Castro and other elders of the revolution will likely retain a degree of power on the Caribbean island as senior leaders of the Communist Party until a party congress set for 2021. Wearing a dark suit in place of military fatigues, Castro sat near Diaz-Canel as an official read out the names of proposed leaders to the 604 legislators gathered at a convention center in a Havana suburb. Castro became president in 2008 when his brother, Fidel Castro, formally handed over power as his health deteriorated. Fidel Castro died in 2016 aged 90. Cuban Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel arrives for a welcome ceremony for then-President Barack Obama at the Palacio de la Revolucion in Havana, March 21, 2016. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Raul Castro brought change, significantly thawing relations with the United States for the first time since the revolution took the island on a sharply leftward path. He also introduced market reforms to one of the world's last Soviet-style centrally planned economies. But Cuba's economy remains smaller than it was in 1985, when it had the support of Communist ally, the Soviet Union, and some Cubans are pessimistic about their lives improving. The economy is suffering the effects of a crisis in oil benefactor Venezuela. Relations with the United States are strained anew under President Donald Trump and Cuba has few allies in the region. The rubber-stamp assembly will vote on another 30 other members of Cuba's state council along with the replacement for Castro. The new president and state council are due to be sworn in on Thursday.

Mark Kaufman,"There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins. But following the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 hurricane season, a group of scientists at Princeton University's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory have identified a connection between the six major hurricanes with winds over 110 mph that churned in the ocean, three of which pummeled the U.S. All were supercharged by unusually warm waters, and these warm conditions outweighed other weather factors. This research published on Thursday in the journal Science has significant climate change implications, as the world is expected to continue its accelerating warming trend. Hurricane Irma on Sept. 8, 2017. Image: nasa Critically, over 90 percent of the accumulating heat on Earth is absorbed by the planet's oceans. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" NASA oceanographer Josh Willis said. Hurricanes feed off warm waters. It's their fuel. But still, warm waters alone don't stoke hurricanes. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence To pinpoint the factors that drove the 2017 hurricane season, the Princeton scientists used a sophisticated climate computing model to simulate the different wide-scale weather conditions on Earth. This is no easy task. Any hurricane season has a number of influences that may propel, or dampen, the storm season or any particular storm. ""It's quite complicated, theres many moving parts,"" Colin Zarzycki, a storm scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""It's not just ocean temperature. It's kind of a big tangled web."" Hurricane Harvey as seen from the International Space Station in August 2017. Image: nasa But even so, after simulating different weather conditions, it became clear that other major climate factors like cooling in the Pacific waters were overpowered by the effects of the unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic. The increase in 2017 hurricanes was caused ""mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic,"" the researchers wrote. But there was another critical factor driving these storms. ""The key point is that the Atlantic was warmer than other open oceans all over the world,"" the study's lead author, Hiroyuki Murakami, said in an interview. This caused more warm air to rise up into the sky over the Atlantic, making the atmosphere more unstable and ripe for tumultuous storm activity. In short, the Atlantic ocean got an ""extra kick"" from all this rising motion, Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane scientist at Florida International University, said over email. ""As a result, thunderstorms that feed hurricanes become stronger,"" said Willoughby. Hurricanes Maria and Jose in September 2017. Image: nasa The power of warm waters The Atlantic wasn't just warm it was much warmer than Earth's other oceans. But regardless, just having unusually warm waters in the Atlantic is still going to fuel powerful storms. ""When you get an ocean basin that gets warm like that, it really primes the atmosphere to be conducive to these strong storms,"" said Zarzycki. ""When you boil it down, with warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures, under ideal conditions we would expect storms to be stronger."" That said, Zarzycki underscores that other weather factors like strong wind shear that pummels and weakens hurricanes can weaken or tear apart any storm. But without these weakening factors, hurricanes can really ignite as they did in 2017. Going forward, what might this all mean for the future storm activity? Should we expect more major hurricanes? In future decades, perhaps by 2080, warming oceans may boost the count of major storms in the Atlantic during a busy season from six to eight, said Murakami. This means more opportunities for giant storms to hit the U.S. coast. But in the next 10 years, he can't say if warmer oceans might generate more major hurricanes. Weather patterns, or natural variability, are just too unpredictable. Hurricane Maria passing over Puerto Rico. Image: nasa ""It remains uncertain as to whether we will see more frequent active hurricane seasons like 2017 in the upcoming decade due to the dominant influence of natural variability,"" Murakami said. For example, there's a major climate trend running on 30-year timescales called the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation, that can warm or cool vast swaths of the Atlantic, said Willoughby. Saharan dust from Africa also blows over the ocean, which can cool the waters, he said. And there are major influences from the Pacific Ocean that can drive down wind shear in the Atlantic. ""All of these well-established oceanic vacillations make it harder to define the long-term warming caused by us humans,"" said Willoughby. So, it's complicated. But one thing is much more certain: Warm oceans fueled the Atlantic's extremely active 2017 season. And overall, we can expect more warm water.","There's no doubt that hurricanes are complicated beasts with complex origins.

Carla Sinclair,"It's fun to fantasize about dropping out of the mainstream to live a life of nomadic travels and adventure. I oughtta know, having tried it myself when my family sold everything to move to the island of Rarotonga. And we learned quickly that fantasy and reality don't always mesh the way we imagine it will. After only five months my family returned to Los Angeles after many misadventures, some of which included chronic fungus infections, relentless lice, school bullying for our daughter who hadn't had that problem back home, and pneumonia that our infant contracted without up-to-date medical care available. So I applaud those who attempt to break out, even if their adventure lasts for only a few months – or a mere two days, such as the case with a couple who had dreams of living on the high seas. Tanner Broadwell and Nikki Walsh were tired of living a 9-5 lifestyle, and decided to sell everything, buy a sailboat, and travel the world. Having no sailing experience didn't deter them (oops). The couple, in their 20s, spent two years planning their adventure, and Broadwell Ubered on the side to speed things up. Last April they bought a 28-foot sailboat, spent time and more money fixing it up, and finally set sail with their two-year-old pug last week from Anclote Key in Florida. Welp, a two-day adventure is better than none, some might agree. According to Tampa Bay Times : It was about 8:45 p.m. when they sailed into a new port, navigating a channel they had never sailed before, in the dark, fog rolling in. Broadwell steered while Walsh stood at the bow, lighting their path with a spotlight, trying to figure out the navigational buoys. But the red and green buoys seemed out of place, they said, and the shoal wasn’t where their 2016-17 navigational charts said it should be. Had Hurricane Irma altered the channel? Then it happened: The Lagniappe struck something underwater. Walsh almost flew off the deck.

Jennifer Jacobs and Ari Natter / Bloomberg,"President Donald Trump called his government’s response to Hurricane Maria an “unsung success” on Tuesday, two weeks after Puerto Rico’s leaders dramatically increased the death toll from the 2017 storm to 2,975 people. Trump has repeatedly defended federal efforts in the wake of Maria, a Category 5 storm that destroyed much of Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and left most of the island without power for weeks or longer. His latest remarks came after he was briefed on Hurricane Florence, now a Category 4 storm, that’s expected to strike the mid-Atlantic coast at the end of the week. “We’re as ready as anybody’s ever been,” he told reporters at the White House. “It’s going to be a very large one.” The states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina haven’t seen a storm of such size and intensity in 25 years or perhaps ever, Trump said. “It’s tremendously big and tremendously wet,” he said. Puerto Rico Criticism The Trump administration was roundly criticized for its performance during a record year of disasters in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey flooded southern Texas before Maria assailed Puerto Rico. In a report issued earlier this month, the government’s chief watchdog found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been overwhelmed by a series of devastating hurricanes and other disasters in 2017. The Government Accountability Office said the agency had failed to adequately house disaster victims, distribute financial assistance in a timely fashion or do enough to prevent fraud. In Puerto Rico, where the estimated death toll from Hurricane Maria has ranged from as low as 64 to as high as 5,000, the accountability office said the agency’s poor response was compounded by a failure to deploy enough qualified staff. “Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success,” Trump said Tuesday. He said that the territory had no electricity even before Maria struck, an exaggeration. While the federal response to storms in Texas and Florida last year was “A-plus,” Trump said, “the best job we did was Puerto Rico, but no one would understand that. They had no electric before the storm hit — it was dead.” The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority was under bankruptcy protection and some parts of the island that lost power during Hurricane Irma hadn’t had electricity restored before Maria hit. But the electricity supply was operating normally before Irma. ‘Devastation’ Planning This time — as Florence and a series of other storms barrel toward the U.S. — FEMA says it’s prepared, even as the agency defends its 2017 response. Florence is forecast to hit the Carolinas later this week. “I’m confident the response in 2017 was good and I’m confident this response will be good,” FEMA Associate Administrator Jeff Byard told reporters during a briefing earlier on Tuesday. “This is not going to be a storm we recover from in days. We are planning for devastation.” At the White House, Trump asked FEMA administrator Brock Long if there was still a chance Florence may veer off into the Atlantic. Long said that the expectation is that it will make landfall. “These will be statewide events,” Long said, urging residents of areas under evacuation orders to flee. “It’s very risky” to remain, Trump added. “It’s going to be really, really bad along the coast.” Ricardo Rosselló, the Governor of Puerto Rico, responded on Tuesday night saying “no relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called a success.”","“The best job we did was Puerto Rico, but no one would understand that""",2018-09-12T00:51:47Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",President Trump Calls Response to Puerto Rico’s Hurricane Maria an ‘Unsung Success’,http://time.com/5393377/trump-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-unsung-success/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1031577192.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Irma,1

(Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) After a nightmarish 2017 hurricane season featuring monsters such as Harvey, Irma and Maria, many in the U.S. are hoping for a quieter year. A top forecasting group says that won't be the case. Meteorologist Phil Klotzbach and other experts from Colorado State University — regarded as the nation's top seasonal hurricane forecasters — predict 14 named tropical storms, of which seven will become hurricanes. Both numbers are above the average of 12 and six, respectively. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its wind speed reaches 74 mph. Of the seven predicted hurricanes, three are expected to spin into major hurricanes — category 3, 4 or 5 — with sustained wind speeds of 111 mph or greater. The group said there's a slightly above-average chance for major hurricanes to make landfall along the U.S. coastline. Klotzbach put the chance of a major hurricane strike at 63%. Colorado State's prediction in 2017 was too low: Last year, in its April forecast, the team predicted that 11 tropical storms would form, of which 4 would become hurricanes. In all, 17 tropical storms developed, of which 10 were hurricanes. One of the prime determining factors in hurricane forecasting is whether we're in an El Niño or La Niña climate pattern, he said. El Niño is a natural warming of tropical Pacific Ocean water, which tends to suppress the development of Atlantic hurricanes. Its opposite number, La Niña, marked by cooler ocean water, tends to increase hurricanes in the Atlantic. Klotzbach said we're now in a weak La Niña event, which appears likely to diminish over the next several months, ""but at this point, we do not anticipate a significant El Niño this summer/fall."" ""The big question marks with this season's predictions are whether a significant El Niño develops, as well as what the configuration of sea-surface temperatures will look like in the tropical and far North Atlantic Ocean during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season,"" according to the forecast. Hurricanes need the fuel of warm ocean water to develop and strengthen. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, though storms sometimes form outside those dates. Insurance companies, emergency managers and the media use the forecasts to prepare Americans for the year's hurricane threat. The team's annual predictions provide a best estimate of activity during the upcoming season, not an exact measure, according to Colorado State. ""We issue these forecasts to satisfy the curiosity of the general public and to bring attention to the hurricane problem,"" Colorado State said in its forecast. ""There is a general interest in knowing what the odds are for an active or inactive season."" The university, under the direction of meteorologist William Gray, was the first group to predict seasonal hurricane activity in the mid-1980s. Gray died in 2016. This is the team's 35th forecast. It covers the Atlantic basin, which includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. AccuWeather released its hurricane forecast for the upcoming season earlier this week, predicting 12-15 named storms would form, of which 6 to 8 will be hurricanes. The firm said 3-4 are likely to hit the U.S. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will issue its forecast in May. The first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season will be Alberto, followed by Beryl, Chris, Debby and Ernesto, the National Hurricane Center said.

Kevin Loria,"A number of factors may make the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season calm compared to last year. NASA Earth Observatory image by Kathryn Hansen, using VIIRS data from LANCE/EOSDIS Rapid Response Earlier in the year, there were some signs that we could be in for another intense Atlantic hurricane season. Initial projections pegged the season as being likely to have slightly more storms than average — though 2017's "" extremely active"" hurricane season began with a similar forecast. Yet early signs of activity aside, projections for the rest of the hurricane season are changing, with experts now projecting a year that's average or even below average in terms of activity. First, a named storm, Subtropical Storm Alberto, showed up in May, a few days before hurricane season even officially kicked off. Hurricanes Beryl and Chris both formed by July 10, the fourth time there had been two hurricanes by that date in the satellite era (since 1966). Beryl threatened Caribbean islands still recovering from hurricanes like Irma and Maria. Chris formed off the coast of the US, whipping up strong surf. The remnants of Chris are now headed out to sea near Newfoundland, Canada, though the storm is still expected to create dangerous rip currents in the Northeast US on Thursday and Friday. Chris had the lowest pressure — a measure of a storm's intensity — for an Atlantic hurricane this early in the season since 2010's Hurricane Alex, Colorado State University (CSU) meteorologist Philip Kotzbach said on Twitter. As Kotzbach also noted, this was the first time since 1906 that a storm as strong as Chris was so far north by this time of year. Conditions around the globe, in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacifc, and in the winds from North Africa, all provide reason to think this year's hurricane season will be less stormy than last year's. Much of the Caribbean is still picking up after the 2017 hurricane season. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins An average hurricane season is based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010. By that definition, an average season includes 12 named storms and six hurricanes, with three of those being major hurricanes — storms that qualify as category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. CSU's newest forecast projects four hurricanes and ten named storms, with one being a major hurricane. If you average the predictions from major research institutions, government agencies, and universities, the mean prediction is six hurricanes, which would make this an average Atlantic season. Hurricanes in the Atlantic are formed by a confluence of global conditions, including ocean temperatures in both the Atlantic and the Pacific (which can affect winds), long-term ocean currents, and atmospheric winds. Right now, the tropical and subtropical Atlantic are abnormally cool, which favors less storm activity since tropical cyclones derive energy from warm waters. A weak El Niño is also looking like it may form in the Pacific, meaning waters there could be slightly warmer than normal. That can create wind shear in the Atlantic, which tears apart hurricanes before they form. Caribbean trade winds are also quite strong right now, which can indicate a quiet season, according to Klotzbach. The final factor that's dampening storms right now comes from Africa. A lot of Saharan dust is being kicked up by winds and carried across the Atlantic, according to NASA. This dust can suppress storms before they form or intensify. Anyone who experienced the 2017 hurricane season in the Atlantic is hoping for a quiet season this year. But just one storm is all it takes to do damage to a populated area.","In 2018, we've seen three named storms form early in the Atlantic, including Hurricane Chris and Hurricane Beryl.

THOMAS KAPLAN,"“Look, there’s not going to be a government shutdown,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “It’s just not going to happen.” But the feud between Mr. Trump and the top Democratic congressional leaders provided ample cause for concern. The acrimony is a stark change from just a few months ago, when Mr. Trump sided with those leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, on a short-term deal to fund the government and increase the debt limit. Now, the president is in direct conflict with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he has called them, at a time when Democrats have substantial leverage. Democrats can block the stopgap spending measure in the Senate, and Democratic votes could also be needed to get the measure through the House if enough Republicans rebel against it. Any long-term spending package would also need Democratic votes. Citing the power that Democrats hold under Senate rules, Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, complained last week that his party was being forced, despite having majorities in both houses, to “produce basically a Democrat document.” “It’s an untenable, unworkable thing, and it’s a hell of a way to run a railroad,” he said. The stopgap spending measure would provide more time for negotiations between the two parties over raising strict spending caps that were imposed in 2011 as they try to work toward a long-term spending deal for the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. In a deal to raise the limits, defense hawks want a sizable increase in military spending. But Democrats are pushing to ensure that nondefense spending is increased by the same amount as military spending. Once congressional leaders reach a deal on raising the caps, a long-term spending package can be negotiated. Lawmakers could pass another stopgap spending measure later in December to keep the government open until that long-term package is ready to be voted on. Photo President Trump at a White House meeting on Tuesday with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders, did not show up after Mr. Trump attacked them on Twitter. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times “We want to keep government open,” Ms. Pelosi said last week. “That’s what we are about.” But she emphasized the need to provide an acceptable increase in nondefense spending as part of a deal to raise the spending caps, citing issues like providing funding to address the opioid epidemic. Lawmakers are also pushing to provide tens of billions of dollars in additional disaster relief in response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Members of both parties called a request from the White House last month to provide $44 billion in aid insufficient. Complicating matters further are divisive issues being dealt with on Capitol Hill beyond financing the government. Republicans are closing in on sending their tax overhaul to Mr. Trump, a feat that would represent their first major legislative accomplishment of his presidency, and they hope to finish that work by Christmas. The future of insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act is also the subject of debate, especially after Senate Republicans added to their tax bill a provision that would end the health law’s requirement that most people have coverage or pay a penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that repealing the so-called individual mandate would increase average premiums on the individual market about 10 percent. A holdout on the tax bill, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, decided to support the legislation in part because Mr. McConnell committed to support passage by the end of the year of two measures intended to reduce premiums under the Affordable Care Act, which Ms. Collins suggested would mitigate the effects of ending the individual mandate. One of those measures would provide funding for subsidies to insurers that Mr. Trump had cut off. But it remains unclear what other legislation those measures would be attached to, and how such a move would be received by House Republicans who have criticized the subsidies as a bailout for insurers. Lawmakers also need to provide funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, whose funding expired at the end of September. Then there is the issue of immigration. Democrats want to secure a deal to protect young unauthorized immigrants put at risk by Mr. Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields them from deportation. Another Republican holdout on the tax bill, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, said in announcing his support for the tax overhaul that he had obtained a commitment from Senate leaders and the Trump administration to work with him to enact protections for DACA recipients. The spending negotiations provide Democrats with leverage for reaching a deal on that issue. But Republican leaders want to address it separately. To force the issue, Democrats could draw a line and withhold their support for a measure to fund the government. But Mr. McConnell warned against that approach on Sunday, noting that Mr. Trump had given Congress until March to find a solution on DACA. “I don’t think that Democrats would be very smart to say they want to shut down the government over a nonemergency that we can address anytime between now and March,” Mr. McConnell said. “That’s a very untenable position.” Democrats are quick to point out which party is in control of the government. “Everyone knows Republicans are in charge,” said Matt House, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer. “If the government shuts down, it’ll be on their back.” Continue reading the main story","A two-week stopgap measure would provide more time to negotiate, but obstacles loom on both sides of the aisle as lawmakers push their own priorities.",2017-12-04T01:54:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","G.O.P.

Meghan Bartels,"During Hurricane Irma's advance over the Caribbean in September 2017, the sun coincidentally produced its own space weather. This interfered with communication during the response to the severe terrestrial weather. That's according to new research looking at how a 10-day period of high solar activity affected radio communication during the hurricane. The situation came to a head on Sept. 6, as Irma was approaching the Virgin Islands and the sun produced a gigantic X9.3 solar flare pointed toward Earth. This flare knocked out radio communication. ""Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,"" lead author Rob Redmon, a space scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in a statement from the American Geophysical Union, which published the new research. [ In Photos: The Monster Solar Flare of September 2017 ] Space weather includes a range of phenomena, from the harmless and beautiful northern lights to coronal mass ejections that fling tons of highly charged plasma out of the sun. More-dramatic types of space weather can affect satellites orbiting Earth, including communication and navigation systems, and can block radio waves moving through Earth's atmosphere. That can mean trouble for emergency response, which often relies on radio communication. And Hurricane Watch Net, a group of amateur radio enthusiasts who assist NOAA during hurricanes, had reported problems during the 10-day period of solar activity in September. ""You can hear a solar flare on the air as it's taking place. It's like hearing bacon fry in a pan. It just all of a sudden gets real staticky, and then it's like someone just turns the light completely off — you don't hear anything. And that's what happened this last year on two occasions,"" ham radio operator and Hurricane Watch Net Manager Bobby Graves said in the statement. ""We had to wait 'til the power of those solar flares weakened so that our signals could actually bounce back off the atmosphere. It was a helpless situation."" The researchers behind the new paper didn't try to figure out the extent to which the communications problems might have slowed down or interfered with the hurricane response. Instead, the scientists focused on precisely what was happening in the sun's atmosphere and how that behavior affected Earth. To do so, the researchers tapped into a range of satellites in orbit right now, including missions studying the sun, like NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and those focused on terrestrial weather, like NOAA's Geostationary Satellite Server (GOES) network. The researchers said they hope that by piecing together a detailed picture of what happened and when, they will be able to better understand how space weather works. That goal should get a lift from NASA's new Parker Solar Probe, currently scheduled to launch on Aug. 11. It's meant, in part, to help scientists better predict space weather and the impacts of the sun here on Earth. That won't prevent another coincidence of severe space and terrestrial weather, but it could help responders better handle such a situation.

Julia Jacobo,"A proposed Florida animal welfare measure would make it illegal for pet owners to leave their dogs behind during a hurricane and other extreme weather scenarios.
Senate Bill 1738 would prohibit people from leaving a dog tied up and unattended outdoors during both man-made and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms or tornadoes, after a warning has been issued by the National Weather Service or an evacuation order has been issued by local officials.
The bill, filed by Florida lawmaker Joe Gruters earlier this month, would authorize veterinarians to report suspected violations without notifying the owner. It states that those who abandon restrained animals ""commit animal cruelty"" and will be subject to a fine up to $5,000 and a first-degree animal cruelty charge punishable by up to a year in prison.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Eillie Anzilotti,"The logic for winter vacations goes something like this: Book a flight to somewhere were the temperatures average in the 80s, pack a swimsuit and SPF 50, and prepare to relax. When I left New York City for a week in early February of this year, though, I only followed half of those rules. I flew to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands not to chill on a beach, but to work. The 32-square mile island, home to just over 50,000 people, was decimated by the back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. A popular tourist and cruise-ship destination, the island’s beaches, are, by now, in good shape; crowds of vacationers have returned to the sand and turquoise waters to tan and venture out on snorkeling trips. [Photo: courtesy of the author] But if you leave the shores and head up into the island’s steep hills, you’ll see a different picture: houses with their roofs blown clear off; churches with no facades, shops boarded up. From overhead, blue tarps are as common as corrugated metal roofs. The governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, a territory that comprises St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, estimates they need $7.5 billion in assistance from the federal government to rebuild the approximately 18,500 homes and businesses destroyed in the storms. But aid, from agencies like FEMA, has been slow to reach the islands, and is unlikely to cover the full costs of recovery. To fill the gap, volunteer groups have stepped in. All Hands And Hearts, the group I volunteered with for the week I was there, set up on St. Thomas in October 2017. The organization–the result of a recent merger between All Hands Volunteers, which coordinates groups of people to do disaster relief work like debris removal, and the Happy Hearts Fund, which finances school rebuilds in disaster-stricken communities–has, to date, completed over 500 projects on St. Thomas, ranging from removing trees from properties, to sanitizing homes after clearing them out. [Photo: courtesy of the author] While I was there, I worked on just one property. It was a six-unit apartment complex just west of the capital city of Charlotte Amalie, owned by a landlord who, once the storms hit, abandoned his tenants and the island. It is property owners, not tenants, who are able to file for FEMA assistance, and because this landlord refused to do so on behalf of his tenants, they were left with no aid. When All Hands And Hearts first assessed the site, they determined it was one of the most severely damaged properties they’d seen to date: Debris was piled around seven feet high in the driveway, and the upstairs was caked in around a foot of shattered drywall amid an obstacle course of dislodged beams and appliances. Barring some wood shop classes and “helping” my dad on construction around the house (but really just watching), I’ve never wielded any power tools. I’ve never used a crowbar. It didn’t matter. As part of a team of 10 people, I helped to clear the driveway and two of the units on the top floor of the apartment. It took an entire week, but those units are now ready to be rebuilt, and it’s estimated that our work as a volunteer team saved the tenant around $80,000 in debris removal costs. I surprised myself with how much I was capable of as an individual (I never thought, for instance, that I would ever dismantle an entire wall and hurl it off a second-floor balcony into a growing pile of cleared-out debris), but that paled in comparison to how blown away I was by how much we could accomplish as a group. [Photo: courtesy of the author] But the experience was not for the faint of heart: The All Hands And Hearts volunteers, who ranged in age from 20 to mid-70s, stayed in a 70-bunk room in a church on the eastern side of the island, where we woke up at 6:30 am, were on the road by 8 a.m., and back to bed, exhausted, by 9 p.m. It was not a glamorous trip. While my team made it to the beach twice after wrapping for the day, we were there to work, and most of our time was spend sweating under the 85-degree humidity in a hard hat. But I don’t think anyone there would’ve had it otherwise–and after this experience, I’ve begun to look at the idea of travel and vacation in a whole different way. All Hands And Hearts operates programs all around the world, from Nepal, where they’re working on earthquake recovery, to the Caribbean, where they’re beginning to expand to islands including Puerto Rico and Dominica, that were affected by Irma and Maria. Once established, the All Hand And Hearts team stays an area not for months, but years–seeing through every stage of recovery from debris removal to complete rebuilding. The only expense is the cost of getting to the site, the program provides food and lodging, and you meet and work with a group of kind, motivated people unlike any other. It is entirely possible to plan travel around where you might be able to spend a week giving back in this way–and I hope to do just that for all of the trips I take going forward.","I flew to the Caribbean for my winter break this year not to relax on a beach, but to do disaster relief work.

Kevin Loria,"Hurricane Florence is churning towards the US East Coast as a major storm. Further out in the Atlantic, Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are picking up steam as they move across waters with conditions favorable for strengthening. In the Caribbean, forecasters are watching a potential disturbance that could become a tropical storm within a few days. When you're anticipating incoming storms, it's understandable to want to know exactly where that storm could have an impact. That's especially true for residents of places that have been battered by storms like Irma, Maria, or Harvey. Forecasts from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) go five days out, yet people often want to know what'll happen a week ahead of time. Because of that, people seek out longer-term forecasts, which sometimes involve ""spaghetti models."" These models are technical tools used by scientists who study weather to better understand storms and how they might behave. But, as you can see in the image below, they tend to look like a bunch of squiggly lines on a map, something that has led to quite a few jokes about forecasting. NCAR Unfortunately, these spaghetti plots are a confusing mess for non-experts, since not every line has equal importance when it comes to predicting where a storm is going. In fact, most meteorologists wish people wouldn't look to them for guidance about how to prepare for a storm. In general, when most of the lines tend on these charts are pointed in the same area, that tends to indicate some agreement between different weather forecasting models. But even then, there can be a lot of variation. Ensemble models like the one below show that using one forecasting system, there are still a number of possible paths — and other forecasting systems would introduce other potential storm routes. NCAR The thing to understand is that these messes of squiggly lines are not the final forecast — they're potential paths that meteorologists use when creating forecasts. Forecasters often aggregate data from multiple models, weighting ones that have proved most accurate. The paths aren't all equally likely to happen, so you can't just look at a spaghetti plot and easily interpret where the storm will go. ""One of the things that the Hurricane Center encourages people to do is not focus on specific track forecasts themselves,"" James Belanger, a senior meteorological scientist with The Weather Company (the group behind The Weather Channel and the Weather Underground forecasting service) told Business Insider last year. According to Belanger, you can classify the slew of different lines you see on these charts into two camps. The first is statistical guidance, which is based on historical data of tropical storms. In some cases, you may even just see tracks of previous storms that were similar, but that doesn't mean any new storm will follow the same track. The second type of plots are based on simulations that incorporate atmospheric physics into the prediction. These use the effects of things like ocean water temperature, air temperature, and wind shear to help calculate where a storm might go. The two main physics-based models are called GFS, which is primarily run in the US, and Euro models that come from Europe. The NHC and other forecasting organizations tend to weigh these physics-based models as more important than the ones that are based on historical data. All of these lines are then used by meteorologists to build a consensus forecast. This forecast takes into account different models, using them to estimate the intensity of the storm and develop a cone within which the storm is most likely to travel. But even then, the intensity of a storm can change rapidly, as Hurricane Florence has shown. In other words, spaghetti models are useful, but primarily for meteorologists. For the rest of us, an official forecast is more helpful.","Three hurricanes are churning through the Atlantic, including Hurricane Florence, which threatens North and South Carolina.

Jordyn Noennig,"Operation Bring Animals Home is based in Pewaukee and working to rescue pets in North Carolina. So far, the rescue has helped move dozens of animals. (Photo: Submitted) Pewaukee-based Operation Bring Animals Home Search and Rescue is rescuing animals from floodwaters in North Carolina in the wake of Hurricane Florence. A group traveled from Lake Country to North Carolina in an RV and truck on Sept. 16. Half of a week into rescue operations, OBAH has so far saved dozens of animals — from cats and dogs stuck in homes to horses and goats that fell victim to flooded pastures. OBAH was started in 2005 when the founder, Caryn Buege, was ""horrified and heartbroken"" seeing images of animals stuck in the middle of Hurricane Katrina's destruction, according to OBAH's Facebook page. OBAH has traveled to hurricanes in the U.S. ever since, including hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Now, the team is responding to areas deluged by Hurricane Florence, which hit the country's southeast coastline in mid-September and caused major flooding throughout North Carolina. When OBAH rescues an animal, their main goal is to return the animal to an owner, said Olivia Spakowicz, media coordinator for OBAH. ""We are pulling animals out of dangerous places and reuniting them with their owners if possible,"" Spakowicz said. ""Sometimes people did not plan for their homes to be flooded. Sometimes shelters will not allow animals and people leave them behind. Some cases, people just view the animal as property instead of family members and (the animal is) left behind as collateral, which is sad to see."" Other animals, like strays or pets that have been surrendered, OBAH finds new homes for by working with foster homes and shelters. RELATED: Other groups, like PETA, work to save animals left stranded by Hurricane Florence OBAH not only rescues pets, but also pasture animals. After hurricane Harvey, the group helped move over 50 cattle to a safe area. This time, OBAH found 10 horses in water, some stuck in flooded pastures with water up to their necks. OBAH volunteers moved the horses from flooded fields to pastures on high ground. ""It's hard to describe, but it's an incredibly rewarding feeling to help a being that cannot help itself,"" Spakowicz said. ""Animals sometimes can't protect themselves so they really rely on humans to be an advocate for them."" OBAH is a volunteer organization that raises money through donations.

Hanneke Weitering,"Two months since Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico, most of the island is still recovering from the disaster — including the Arecibo Observatory, home of the world's second-largest radio telescope. This week, the dozens of astronomers and other staff at the facility have some good news to celebrate: The Arecibo Observatory will remain open after years of being on the chopping block. The National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds approximately two-thirds of the observatory's annual budget of $12 million, announced on Thursday (Nov. 16) that it will not shut down the Arecibo Observatory. This decision comes after more than a decade of discussions about the future of the 54-year-old observatory. However, this good news comes with one drawback: The NSF still plans to withdraw much of the funding it gives to the observatory, reducing its annual contribution from $8.2 million to $2 million over the next five years, the journal Nature reports. But instead of leaving the observatory high and dry, the NSF is working to secure new partnerships with other institutions that can take over the burden of funding and managing the facility. [ Arecibo Observatory: Puerto Rico's Giant Radio Telescope in Photos ] ""This is very good news for the Arecibo Observatory and a huge win for the scientific community in general,"" Francisco Córdova, the observatory's director, told Nature. ""There is definitely a sense of relief in the air."" The announcement brought a much-needed sigh of relief to the people who operate the observatory as well as many other members of the local community who found shelter and solace at the facility after losing their homes in Hurricane Maria. While the Arecibo Observatory fared pretty well during hurricane compared to much of the rest of the island, it did sustain some minor damages. With the NSF already working on plans to reduce funding and potentially close the observatory, costly damages could have been the last straw. However, the damage turned out to be minimal. The NSF estimates that repairs should cost somewhere between $4 million and $8 million. ""NSF remains deeply concerned about the impacts from recent hurricanes on Arecibo Observatory staff, the facility and all citizens of Puerto Rico,"" NSF officials said in a statement, adding that the decision ""arrives at a challenging time, but is necessary for the agency to secure a future for the observatory. It will allow negotiations to begin with potential collaborators who may take over management and operations as NSF funding for the observatory is reduced. ""We were quite surprised by how little damage there was,"" John Kelly, an investigator with SRI International, which helps to operate the observatory, told Space.com. ""The reflector itself sustained minor damage when a couple of minor feed antennas broke and fell into the dish, damaging 15 or 20 of the panels. There are thousands of panels that make up that reflector, and only about 15 or 20 have been damaged. And they're replaceable … I don't think the damage is anywhere near what would be considered a justifiable reason for decommissioning the facility at this point,"" Kelly said. In addition to the NSF, SRI International and other research institutions, the Arecibo Observatory also receives funding from NASA to look for near-Earth asteroids that could pose a danger to the planet. Astronomers also use the facility to look for potentially habitable exoplanets and signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.

Seth Borenstein / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005. Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year. Hurricane Harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90 billion, ranking third, NOAA said. Irma was $50 billion, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to NOAA. “While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. NOAA announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas. The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6 degrees (12.6 degrees Celsius) — 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006. This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above average temperatures for the year. Five states — Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico — had their warmest year ever.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The unexpected friendship between Randi Weingarten and Bill Horan might sound like the beginning of a joke: The president of the American Federation of Teachers — a progressive union leader who happens to be a lesbian married to a rabbi — and the president of the Christian nonprofit humanitarian organization Operation Blessing, founded by the controversial evangelical Pat Robertson, both walk into a bar. Can you guess what happens next? Unlike the classic joke, Weingarten and Horan didn't meet in a bar. They were introduced to each other last year, in the wake of Hurricane Maria, by Carmen Yulín Cruz (the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, whom you may remember went toe-to-toe with Donald Trump). What happened next may surprise — and delight — you. SEE ALSO: Lin-Manuel Miranda creates arts fund for Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria Operation Blessing, which specializes in disaster relief, had been on the ground for two weeks in Puerto Rico, working to supply residents with water filters, among other essential goods and services. Power failures meant water treatment plants couldn't operate, so they'd focused on that urgent need at Cruz's request. Then Weingarten arrived in San Juan. She was particularly distressed by school closures, which spelled instability for students across the island. She went to Cruz with one question: What can we do? Cruz pointed the union president in Horan's direction and suggested she work with Operation Blessing to get clean drinking water into schools so they could reopen. So Horan and Weingarten rushed to form the partnership they called Operation Agua, a campaign to deliver 100,000 water filtration systems to dozens of communities throughout Puerto Rico. The gravity-fed filters are meant for households or community settings and can produce up to 10 gallons of clean water per day. Randi Weingarten (left); Evelyn DeJesus, vice president of AFT; and Bill Horan (right) at the Operation Agua hub in 2017. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing ""We may be strange bedfellows, but it’s rare that people can just park whatever their political persuasions and ideology may be and try to help people in trouble, and that’s what happened here,"" says Horan, who retired from Operation Blessing this year. Weingarten first suggested raising money for the effort through AFT's disaster relief fund. Then Operation Blessing could use that money to pay for more filters and filtration devices, which it was already obtaining at a discount from the bath and kitchen manufacturing company Kohler. Weingarten appealed to union members to pitch in. That took the pressure off Operation Blessing to fundraise. By the time Hurricane Maria struck in mid-September last year, following the devastation wrought by Irma and Harvey, the nonprofit began to see a ""donor fatigue"" dip in contributions for hurricane relief. Horan says AFT's fundraising — which has totaled about $2 million — likely doubled Operation Blessing's impact in Puerto Rico. Weingarten also secured support from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Seafarers International Union (SIU); and the Asociación de Maestros de Puerto Rico (AMPR), the island's teachers union. Members of those organizations, as well as the Hispanic Federation, ultimately helped distribute the filters directly to communities in need. Map of filter distribution events. Black pushpins mark places where Operation Agua handed out filters. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing It wasn't long before TOTE Maritime, one of two shipping companies that operates vessels to and from Puerto Rico, agreed to send containers full of filtration systems from the U.S. to the island pro bono. Operation Blessing put its own expertise managing inventory and logistics to use. Operating out of a warehouse in San Juan, the nonprofit coordinated the distribution of shipping containers that arrived at the port, and received additional support from members of SIU. Amancio Crespo, the SIU representative at the port, embraced his new calling. Acting as a conduit between the vessels, ship operators, and local communities, he ensured that filters made it to their intended destinations as quickly as possible. He tapped local union members to identify churches and community organizations whose members needed filtration devices. Sometimes Crespo, the son of a Pentecostal minister, loaded up his own Dodge RAM 150 truck with pallets of filters and drove them to churches of all denominations where he had personal relationships. Hundreds of people would gather to receive a filter. ""The job was done right because it wasn’t just depending on one agency or one group of people — everyone deserves recognition,"" he says. ""I think we touched a lot of lives."" Operation Agua filter distributions in November 2017, in partnership with the Hispanic Federation. Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing By Christmas break, members of the AMPR had reached more than 270,000 students by distributing 3,849 water filters to most schools on the island. Operation Blessing trained members of the teachers union to assemble and clean the filters. The containers are reusable and the replaceable filters last for a year of continuous use, which means classrooms may well turn to them again in the wake of a hurricane. By the end of August, the group expects to bring the remaining 6,500 filtration systems to the island to meet the original distribution goal. Weingarten and Horan forged what they hope is a lasting bond — and a model that people on different points of the political spectrum might consider emulating to help those in need. ""If you meet people where they are, and if you work on a values proposition — that in America we care about families and we care about their health and safety — then you can work with all sorts of strange bedfellows,"" says Weingarten, echoing Horan's phrase. ""It starts creating trust and lessening the divisiveness in this country."" Scene from an Operation Agua distribution event Image: American Federation of Teachers / Operation Blessing It certainly helped, Weingarten and Horan say, that Cruz played matchmaker. Both of them trusted her vision and leadership. The campaign was also an effort to leverage Operation Blessing's logistics expertise and the AFT's vast union network in the name of bringing vulnerable people clean drinking water — a mission in which political fault lines are much easier to avoid than developing an alliance around, say, policy. At a time when unions possess significantly diminished political power, Weingarten says what happened in Puerto Rico is a testament to their impact in local communities. ""We are a family, and caring is an important aspect of being part of a union,"" she ways. ""We're fighting for things like wages and parental leave, but it’s also about caring and showing up."" AFT has done previous relief work during other disasters, but the organization now has a ""very robust"" process for determining how it can contribute, says Weingarten. Neither she or Horan know exactly how they'll partner together in the future, but both are hopeful their connection will endure. ""There was cooperation at every level,"" says Horan. ""No one cares who’s voting for who in the next election when it’s that type of cooperation.""",The unexpected friendship between Randi Weingarten and Bill Horan might sound like the beginning of a joke: The president of the American Federation of Teachers — a progressive union leader who happens to be a lesbian married to a rabbi — and the president of…,2018-08-07T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",How a lesbian union president and evangelical nonprofit leader teamed up to get Puerto Rico clean water,https://mashable.com/2018/08/07/clean-water-puerto-rico-operation-agua/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7C5mz1Zk_LCEvrp3J-ia-kDNfNA=/1200x630/2018%2F08%2F06%2Fc0%2Fe55daaffac9841178eca97c129ba4ed5.b609f.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Irma,1
Jeffrey Preis,"Au revoir, Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate. Bonjour, Harold, Idallia, Margot and Nigel. A committee from the World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it is retiring the names of four Atlantic hurricanes from 2017. Because of the massive destruction and death caused by these hurricanes, Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate will never be included in the rotation for Atlantic hurricanes again. They will be replaced with Harold, Idallia, Margot and Nigel. WMO Hurricane Committee retired 4 names from its rotating lists (used every 6 years). 2005 season holds the record with 5 names sent into hurricane history (Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan and Wilma) pic.twitter.com/T7kUUZb1NP — WMO | OMM (@WMO) April 12, 2018 Typically, the list of names for hurricanes and tropical storms rotates every six years. This is the fifth time that four hurricane names have been retired from the list in one year — the most retirees for a single year was during 2005 when an unusual amount of Atlantic storms caused widespread damage and destruction; those retired in 2005 were Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan and Wilma. Since 1963, when WMO started naming Atlantic hurricanes, 86 names have been retired from the list. Maria and Nate were both used three times during their rotations; Irma was used twice for Atlantic storms; Harvey has been used six times since 1981. As far as the 2018 hurricane season goes, meteorologists are predicting an even busier season with 14 named storms: seven are expected to become hurricanes and three are expected to be major hurricanes.

Sasha Ingber,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in all 67 counties on Saturday in preparation for Subtropical Storm Alberto. ""As we continue to monitor Subtropical Storm Alberto's northward path toward Florida, it is critically important that all Florida counties have every available resource to keep families safe and prepare for the torrential rain and severe flooding this storm will bring,"" Scott said in a written statement. He added, ""If any Florida family doesn't have an emergency preparedness plan, now is the time to act."" Alberto is expected to travel across the eastern Gulf of Mexico Saturday night through Monday and approach the northern part of the Gulf where it could make landfall Monday night. Regardless of its path and intensity, Alberto expected to bring heavy rains of more than 10 inches and flash flooding to western Cuba and southern Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. A storm surge watch is in effect along the U.S. gulf coast, from Crystal River to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Water could reach up to 4 feet above ground in some areas if the peak surge occurs during high tide, the agency said on Facebook. A tornado ""or two"" may occur over the Florida Keys and parts of southwestern Florida later Saturday afternoon or evening. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center caused eyebrows to raise when it estimated a 90 percent chance that a subtropical or tropical cyclone would form in the central or eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. On Friday morning, the agency announced that an area of low pressure in the Caribbean had developed into Subtropical Storm Alberto with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. By Saturday morning, the storm was gathering strength as it moved north. Between Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Irma in the Caribbean and southeastern U.S. and Maria in Puerto Rico, last year was one of the most active hurricane seasons on record, said The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA does not expect 2018 to be quite as busy, but it could still wreak havoc on human life and infrastructure. One of the most deadly natural disasters in U.S. history occurred in Florida 90 years ago. In 1928, the Okeechobee Hurricane caused the death of at least 2,500 people. ""Nobody seemed to be too much alarmed,"" a survivor told the Sun Sentinel, ""until the water started coming in."" According to the paper, politicians at the time downplayed the storm's severity to keep tourists flocking to Florida as a vacation spot. In a visit to Panama City Beach yesterday, Scott said, ""We have already moved some high water vehicles up to the panhandle from Fish and Wildlife."" Alberto is the first named storm of 2018, and it comes days before the Atlantic hurricane season officially starts on June 1.",The first named storm of the season is expected to bring heavy rains and flash flooding.

Phil Nickinson,"Hurricane Michael, as of 5 p.m. EDT October 8. (Image credit: Colorado State University) Ed. Note: We're re-upping this with Hurricane Michael headed to the Gulf Coast this week. Stay safe out there, everybody. And if you're told to evacuate, DO IT! For the latest on any storm, visit the National Hurricane Center. You don't want to be caught unaware when a hurricane hits, and as we've learned recently, they can arrive unexpectedly, and in unexpected places. Hopefully anyone in the direct path of Hurricane Irma has already gotten out of the way. For folks on the outskirts, though — and everyone else who lives where a hurricane or typhoon can happen, there's still plenty of storm season left. And there's no better time than now to bone up on some of the best ways to keep current on what's out there, and how to stay safe if a storm comes your way. And just like with everything else, our smartphones now play an integral part with that. I've lived on the Gulf Coast my entire life. I've been through storms. God willing, I'll never go through another. But either way, I'll be ready. Let's take a look at a few ways you can be, too. Websites and apps If you only use one website for tracking tropical activity, it needs to be the National Hurricane Center's site, found at www.nhc.noaa.gov. (They've got a mobile version, too, if you're into that sort of thing.) I also recommend Weather Underground's site, too, and the blog written by Jeff Masters. What about apps, though? I've used a few over the years. Mostly they're wrappers for the NHC website, and for the most part the apps themselves are pretty crap. And you don't really need them. They can, however, be good for notifications of new updates, which the NHC puts out every six hours. If you don't want to spend a few bucks, you could just hit up the NHC site, or follow their Twitter feed, or use RSS or e-mail. (The NHC has a lot of ways to stay informed.) The one app I've used off and on during hurricane season is SeaStorm Hurricane Tracker, which costs $1.99. Even then, I only really use it for the alerts. And if you just don't want to bother committing all of these tips to memory, go for the American Red Cross' hurricane app. More: The best weather apps for Android Your phone There's almost nothing worse than knowing a hurricane is headed your way. They're big. They're often slow. You could have days or even weeks of warning. That gives you plenty of time to prepare. And our phones make it easier than ever. A few tips I've picked up the hard way: Inventory your home and car. Use notes apps that sync to the cloud (that's the really important part) to keep track of everything you own, for insurance purposes. If it's not documented, it might as well have never existed. Take pictures. Lots of pictures. The outside of your home. The inside of your home. Pets. Kids. Anything of value. Insurance fraud, unfortunately, is a thing. You'll want to prove your car didn't already have that tree on it. Again, make sure your pictures are uploaded to a cloud service like Google Photos or Dropbox. Charge early and often. When the power goes out, it goes out. That said, data could well be down after a strong storm. (Though operators will be quick to tell you they've been hardening against storms.) If that's the case enjoy the silence, and don't waste battery if you don't have to. Speaking of charging... Batteries are our lifeblood. I mean, our phones' lifeblood. If you want any hope of communicating after a storm, or keeping up with folks during a storm, you'll need to stay charged. The good news is that even if you don't (or can't) use a full-blown generator, we've got options. We've seen an explosion (figuratively, that is) of small and inexpensive external batteries. This very much changes the game for post-storm charging. You should have a few on hand. We're fans of this 20,000 mAh battery from Anker. USB-A and USB-C, so it'll charge pretty much everything. (And, yes, it's on that ""good"" list for USB-C.) A good bit more expensive, and maybe a little crazy (in a good way) is the Anker PowerHouse — a 434Wh (that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 120,000 mAh) gianormous AC or solar-powered backup battery/inverter. Unfortunately for most of us, it's still a little early for this future-tech solution. Other random things worth buying Batteries are obvious. So are lamps of some sort. And food that doesn't spoil. I also recommend picking up a sun shower of come sort. These are large PVC bags that use the sun to heat the water within, and gravity to rain it down upon your body. I used them on boats growing up, but they're perfect for post-storm showers. You don't need electricity to heat the water, they're portable, and they're easy to store. This one looks just fine — but you've basically got your pick on Amazon. If you're buying locally, any sporting goods store or boat store should have them in stock. I'd also recommend picking up a battery-powered AM/FM Weather radio. Again, you need to conserve things like your phone for when you really need them. These ancient little radios run on batteries and will keep you up with important local info as well with NOAA weather radio. They're indispensable once the power goes out.

Kevin Loria,"The 2018 hurricane season begins June 1. Most initial forecasts project that the number of storms will be above average, and several forecasts indicate an above-average likelihood that a major hurricane will make landfall in the Caribbean, the Gulf Coast, or the East Coast. For residents still picking up after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, it's too soon. Before the 2017 hurricane season started, forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project, and The Weather Channel had pegged that year as likely to be above average but not extreme. It turned out to be one of the most disastrous, extremely active hurricane seasons on record. So it's important to remember that the current forecasts are still preliminary and will be updated at the start of the season and during the season. A man looks for valuables in the damaged house of a relative after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Guayama, Puerto Rico September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins What to expect for 2018 An average hurricane season is based on the 30-year average from 1981-2010. By that definition, an average season includes 12 named storms and six hurricanes, with three of those being major hurricanes — storms that qualify as category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The researchers at Colorado State's Tropical Meteorology Project issued their extended range forecast for the 2018 season on April 5, predicting 14 named storms. Of those, they forecast seven hurricanes, three of which could be major. The Weather Channel's early predictions suggest a more average year, with 13 named storms and six hurricanes, two that qualify as major hurricanes. A team at North Carolina State announced April 16 that they predict 14 to 18 named storms, seven to 11 of which are hurricanes. Of those, they expect three to five to be major. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet to release their early season guidance. Hurricanes in the Atlantic are formed by a confluence of global conditions, including ocean temperatures in both the Atlantic and Pacific (which can affect winds), long-term ocean currents, and atmospheric winds. Right now, the western Atlantic is abnormally warm, but the eastern and northern Atlantic are abnormally cool. A weak La Niña event in the Pacific (which means that waters are cool) is expected to transition to a state of ""ENSO-neutral,"" meaning there won't be any La Niña or El Niño conditions. That was the situation last year as well. People walk through the flooded waters of Telephone Road in Houston on Sunday as the city battles with tropical storm Harvey and resulting floods. Thomas B. Shea/AFP/Getty Images It takes just one storm No matter how many storms end up forming in the coming months, it's important to remember that it takes only one hurricane hitting a populated area to make a season ""active"" for coastal residents. Even storms that don't qualify as major hurricanes can still have major consequences. Harvey qualified as a tropical storm, not a hurricane, when it dumped record-setting rains on Houston and other parts of the Gulf Coast, causing the majority of the $125 billion worth of damage. A recent study found that in recent years, storms have become more intense in a short period of time, undergoing rapid intensification. That was the case for several of the most destructive storms of last summer and fall. Researchers also say that as the world gets warmer, we can expect to see more intense storms that dump more rain, causing floods. Even though hurricane season starts soon, the season typically becomes more active later in the summer, reaching a peak in September. For residents of the still-storm-battered Caribbean, the hope is for a respite in 2018. But it's time to start preparing.","The 2018 hurricane season begins June 1.

Zahra Hirji,"It’s official: 2017 set a new record for big, costly disasters in the United States. The nation was struck by 16 hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters last year, each with losses exceeding $1 billion. Combined, these weather and climate disasters cost about $306 billion, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hurricanes were the biggest source of damages by far. This past hurricane season resulted in a record-high $265 billion in losses, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all ranked in the top five most expensive US tropical cyclones based on preliminary estimates. Although Katrina remained the most expensive hurricane ($161.3 billion), Harvey ranked second ($125 billion), Maria third ($90 billion), Sandy fourth ($70.2 billion), and Irma fifth ($50 billion). The three major hurricanes last year killed about 250 people combined, NOAA estimates. Maria knocked out Puerto Rico’s entire electric grid, triggering the largest blackout in US history. Both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are still recovering from the direct strike by the Category 4 hurricane. While Florida continues to recover from Irma’s strong winds and coastal flooding, Texas is still responding to the flood-related damage from Harvey’s record rainfall that dumped up to 50 inches in some places. Previously, 2005 was the most expensive year for disasters, largely due to devastation brought by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. A string of deadly fires in the West, including the largest fire in California’s recent history, generated about $18 billion in losses, the new report found. That’s three times higher than the past annual record, according to NOAA. These fires claimed the lives of at least 54 people and damaged or destroyed more than 15,000 homes and other buildings. Some of the other costly US disasters last year include: an outbreak of tornadoes in various southern states in January; California flooding in February; a freeze in the southeast that damaged fruit crops in March; and severe thunderstorms in the midwest in June. Besides being an expensive year for disasters, 2017 was also the third-warmest for the contiguous US since record-keeping began in 1895, NOAA scientists said. The hottest year was 2012, followed by 2016.",Last year marked the costliest US wildfire and hurricane seasons on record.
