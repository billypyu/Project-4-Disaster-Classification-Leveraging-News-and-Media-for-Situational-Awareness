Emily Price,"Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging. Even more challenging is finding activities your child wants to do that for your family’s schedule. KidPass is a mobile app that works in major cities sort of like ClassPass does for gyms, except instead of pilates and yoga the events are all things like swimming lessons, art classes, and trips to the zoo. The idea is that you don’t have to sign up to commit to a particular activity without knowing if your child is going to like it, and you can do a variety of different things each month. So, you can try art lessons and if it’s a hit come back, or if it’s not, swap it out for karate or a trip to the museum the next week. Using the service requires a mobile app. A Basic plan is $49 a month and includes 10 “activity credits” that will translate into 2-3 activities during the month (some events require more credits than others). Super active parents can get 50 activity credits for $189 a month. Credits roll over from month to month for 90 days, so if you go on a vacation or just get busy one month you don’t lose them. The number of activity credits something takes varies. A swim class at the YMCA might set you back 3 credits in a month, while a music class with a smaller group might be 5. The subscription is month-to-month, so if you know things are about to get hectic or you’d rather sign up for that art class exclusively, you can bail. On a basic level, it can be a good resource for finding new things to check out near you, especially if you have a child who tends to like to try a variety of activities rather than just one, or your family has one of those schedules where another regular weekly commitment just won’t work.",Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging.

Where many gaming mice place adjustable weights in one spot, the Rival 600 puts its weights on the side. This lets you adjust the center of gravity of the mouse rather than just its overall heft.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Zero exercise is not enough. Going for a walk every day is probably a good thing. And if you’re training for a marathon, you’ll be on your feet for a couple hours of hard workouts every week. But what is the benchmark for a human being just trying to squeeze enough healthy exercise into their life? Let’s break it down. It’s easy to feel motivated about the idea of exercising. Let’s all run marathons! And do a push-up … Read more Read Fortunately, all the major public health organizations are in agreement. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association are all on board with the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise like walking, ideally broken up into 30 minutes per day over five days 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise like running, ideally in three 25-minute chunks It only counts if you do 10 minutes or more in each session, and you should spread your sessions throughout the week (so, you can’t take a single 90-minute spinning class and figure you’re done.) If you’re a stroll-around-the-neighborhood person, go with the first recommendation. If you enjoy hard workouts, but would rather not change into your gym clothes every day, you can just go with the 75 minute recommendation. And feel free to mix and match. Here are some possibilities: Walk 15 minutes to and from work every week day (5 x 30 minutes = 150 moderate) Go running on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, each for 2-3 miles (3 x 25 minutes = 75 vigorous) Take a 90-minute heart-pounding cycling class, and go for a walk after dinner at least a few other days of the week (1 x 90 minutes = 90 vigorous, plus perhaps 3 x 15 = 45 moderate) Go for a 30-minute easy bike ride on Monday. Try a 45-minute water aerobics class on Wednesday. Take a short hike on Saturday. Mow the lawn for an hour on Saturday. (30 + 45 + 30 + 60 = 165 moderate) If you’re confused about what counts in each category, the UK’s National Health Service has a list of “moderate” and “vigorous” activities here. I love long walks and runs, but I tend to not too many of them for one reason: I get bored. Walking … Read more Read If you’re pretty athletic, the above won’t sound like much. Good news! The WHO has set a secondary goal for folks like you. It’s simple: just do double the above. So you can aim for 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity: Two of those killer 90-minute classes, Monday and Thursday A three-mile run every weekday An hour-long martial arts class three times a week...or, to meet the requirement with moderate activity, you can stroll for an hour before breakfast each day, the favorite activity of spunky grandmas and grandpas who will probably never die. (To be fair, the recommendations we’re talking about are for people up to age 65.) So, what about an upper limit? There isn’t one, from a public health point of view. More is better. (And even if you are doing less than the recommendations, anything is better than nothing.) That said, it is possible for you as an individual to do more exercise than your body is ready for. Don’t jump from a life of occasional strolling to a marathon training plan. And if you are on that marathon training plan and you’re feeling worn down, take a break already. Strength, Flexibility, and More So far we’ve been talking about aerobic exercise, which is the kind where you’re continuously moving (or, perhaps, doing quick work/rest intervals) and your heart rate is up. But there are other important forms of exercise, too. The WHO and other organizations recommend two days per week of “high intensity muscle strengthening activity,” which includes anything where you’re thinking in terms of sets and reps. (Three sets of eight to 10 reps is a good structure to start.) So, your workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps for this exercise, 3 sets of 8 after that, and—oh,… Read more Read That activity can be anything that challenges your muscles, and where the 10th rep is a lot harder than the first: lifting weights, or resistance band exercises, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups. So if you run three days per week but have time for more, don’t just fit in extra runs; try adding two days in the weight room instead. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends two other kinds of exercise you might otherwise forget: Two to three days per week that include stretching, ideally spending 60 seconds stretching each major muscle group. This can be in a few short stints of 10-30 seconds each. Two to three days per week that include neuromuscular training. Think of this as hand-eye coordination and its full-body equivalents. Anything involving balance, coordination, or paying attention to your gait fall into these categories. Both of these can fit into your other workouts. Stretching works well in a cool-down session after your main workout, or some people prefer to put it into a warm-up. If you’re doing functional movements like lunges that challenge your balance and coordination, you’re working on neuromuscular fitness.","Zero exercise is not enough.

Entrepreneur Staff,"September 26, 2018 3 min read Many entrepreneurs claim to have innovative solutions to problems that plague millions. But it doesn’t matter how good someone’s idea is, or how much energy they have in pitching it. It matters whether they can build a viable business around their product. On every episode of Entrepreneur’s weekly pitch show, Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch, contestants get just 60 seconds to sell a panel of four prominent investor judges on their ability to do just that. That minute-long pitch happens inside the Entrepreneur Elevator, while the judges watch via livestream on an upper floor. When the time is up, the entrepreneur waits anxiously (or kills time doing a product demo) just steps away from the deliberating investors behind the Entrepreneur Elevator doors. The judges then vote: Should they grant the contestant more time to elaborate and potentially seal a deal, or have they heard all they need to hear? Related: Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch Season 3 Episode 1: 'Is She Pitching Us?' The investors don’t always agree right away on whether to open the doors or to send an entrepreneur down without facetime with them. From there, in cases where they do concede to let them in, they don’t always see eye to eye on what’s a reasonable deal. From a group of guys who aim to “change education” for “the Wi-Fi generation” to a woman who thinks her app is the cure to loneliness, this week's ideas run the gamut. One founder admits how he’s faced obstacles in selling his promising product. Guest judge and PLG Ventures founder Peter Goldberg asks him, “How, as the CEO of this company, are you going to implement and execute to make this a successful business?” The entrepreneur responds with a surprising story that makes the panel realize, maybe it’s a “no for now” and an opportunity to share their robust networks in the meantime. Should a pitch make or break an entrepreneur’s chances at funding? How important is the ability to think on your feet as a business leader?

But Mercedes added an additional feature to the vehicle; Interior Assistant. The gesture-based system can be used to enable functions in the vehicle and can determine if something is being initiated by the driver or passenger. At night, it'll even turn on the reading with a simple gesture.

Jon Levy,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Every career-minded person knows that success doesn’t depend on what you know, but who you know. The people you surround yourself with hold a profound impact on your quality of life and career. According to research by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler, everything from the likelihood of obesity and divorce to voting habits and happiness can spread from person to person through our networks, much like the common cold. Therefore, surrounding yourself with the right people is key to success in your career and life, but how do you curate the right community? What separates the world’s greatest connectors from that annoying person who hands you their business card before you know their name? Scott Gerber and Ryan Paugh, co-founders of The Community Company and authors of the book Superconnector : Stop Networking and Start Building Business Relationships that Matter, have spent the last decade researching what it takes to form meaningful relationships that contribute to a person’s overall success and happiness. Related: 'Superconnectors:' 3 Steps to Becoming a Networking Genius With the latest release of their book, Gerber and Paugh point to three practices that can help anyone reshape their personal and business relationships. 1. Pyramid of influence. Most people think that they should reach out to the person at the top of the organizational pyramid -- a CEO, founder or C-level executive. Most of the time, that is the wrong person. Also, the chances of connecting with someone at that level are slim if the one reaching out isn’t in a similar position. It’s even more so if there is no connection to that individual’s inner circle. Instead of going for the top of the pyramid, view it as a series of steps or a ladder. If you want to reach the top, you need to connect with some people below there and work your way up. Early in his career, Keith Ferrazzi, author of Never Eat Alone, wanted to meet Hillary Clinton. Instead of waiting in line for a hand shake and a few seconds of unremarkable interaction, he met and built a relationship with her executive assistant. After a multiyear process of connecting with people within Clinton’s circle and establishing himself as a helpful ally, he got an invite into the White House and forged a more meaningful relationship with her in the process. The goal wasn’t to meet her, but to put himself in the right circles. Before reaching out, do your research. Find out which department and person you need to contact first. The top person may not be the right contact for what you want to accomplish, and often, you’ll need to establish relationships beforehand. Related: The New Way to Network 2. Power of association. When you have people around you that trust you enough to connect you with others, your credibility is strengthened. It’s what’s known as the power of association. Superconnector Jayson Gaignard was once destitute and looking for the next big thing when he decided to invest in his relationships and started MastermindTalks, an invite-only event that brings together entrepreneurs. To get prestigious members of the entrepreneur community to come, he said, “I’m going to buy books for you to be my speakers at the Mastermind.” The tactic worked, because he got Tim Ferriss’ attention, buying 4,000 of his books. Even though he was nearly broke at the time, he connected with Ferriss and now has his credibility through the power of association. The idea is that when you bring powerful people together and become part of their circle, you could elevate to the same level. The associations that you have with other people become part of your brand and reputation. 3. Art of selectivity. According to the art of selectivity, you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with most often. Superconnectors can and should be selective about who is part of their community. Instead of casting a wide net and meeting as many people as you can, it is more important to cultivate one or two meaningful relationships that are going to add value. It could include industry influencers or journalists, but figure out what is important to you and your community. Choosing your connections wisely will attract a highly targeted group of people that align with those interests. Related: How To Become a Master Connector in 5 Easy Steps You also want to have diversity.

Jack Stewart,"When the Ford GT won its class in the famously grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race last year, it wasn't just a celebration for the team which developed the all new supercar. It was a relief. The victory in the GTE Pro class came 50 years after Ford's historic 1966 win with the GT40, when the American automaker proved (mostly to spite Ferrari) that it could dominate the track in Europe as well as the US. Marking the golden anniversary of that defining moment with anything less than first place would have been a letdown. But engineers took a huge gamble in the development of the all new GT: They threw out the V8 engine, the kind of engine it rode to victory in the 1960s, which many believed essential to producing the kind of power necessary to win a race like Le Mans. Instead, they opted for the turbocharged V6 EcoBoost, best known for powering the company's F-150 pickup truck—not exactly the same use case. That choice sent them on a mission to double the horsepower to an insane 647, from just 3.5 liters of displacement. ""What's critical for these performance engines is you have to get all the power out of them that you can,"" says Ben Peterson, a research engineer at Ford. But they couldn't stop there, they also had to make sure it could survive a full 24 hours on the track. They redesigned the way the engine breathed, using computer modeling software and 3-D printing. They pushed key components to the limits of failure and beyond, and tested the result on the track and in super accurate simulators. This is the story of the engine that went from hauling hay to hauling ass.",The inside story of how the automaker turned a pickup truck powerplant into a Le Mans-winning supercar engine.,2017-12-15T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How Ford Build a New Kind of Engine for Its GT Supercar,https://www.wired.com/story/ford-gt-supercar-engine/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a31b7b2718f5c5e6ece7219/191:100/pass/fordnew-fa.jpg,wired,Wired,class-3,1
Mariella Moon,"When it announced that the Model 3's production was on track last year, Tesla said the issues that caused its backlog hadn't cropped up yet. It did admit late last year that it was experiencing production bottlenecks mainly due to battery module assembly problems in its Gigafactory facility. And company chief Elon Musk also revealed in an interview that using too many robots for production did more harm than good. Tesla might not have emerged out of it all unscathed, but it seems to be doing better on that front recently. Earlier this month, the company reported that it was finally able to build over 2,000 cars per week for three weeks in a row and it's aiming to starting manufacturing 5,000 cars per week in two months' time. In addition to detailing its production problems, Tesla also wrote in the court filing that its $4 billion investment in Model 3, Gigafactory's development Nevada and all the equipment it commissioned for the project show its ""good faith belief"" in the vehicle. Whether those are enough to convince the court to throw the case out remains to be seen -- for now, the lawsuit is seeking class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stocks from May 4th, 2016 to October 6th, 2017. A hearing is also scheduled to take place sometime in August.","Tesla has asked a federal court in San Francisco to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit filed by shareholders, which accuses the automaker of lying about its ability to mass produce the Model 3 sedan.

Kirsten Korosec,"Sony’s venture capital arm has invested in what3words, the startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned a three-word address to each one.
Financial details were not disclosed.
The startup’s novel addressing system isn’t the whole story. The ability to integrate what3words into voice assistants is what has piqued the interest and investment from Sony and others.
“what3words have solved the considerable problem of entering a precise location into a machine by voice. The dramatic rise in voice-activated systems calls for a simple voice geocoder that works across all digital platforms and channels, can be written down and spoken easily,” Sony Corporation’s senior vice president Toshimoto Mitomo said in a statement.
Last year, Daimler took a 10% stake in what3words, following an announcement in 2017 to integrate the addressing system into Mercedes new infotainment and navigation systemcalled the Mercedes-Benz User Experience or MBUX. MBUX is now in the latest Mercedes A-Class, B-Class cars and Sprinter commercial vehicles. Owners of these new Mercedes-Benz vehicles are now be able to navigate to an exact destination in the world by just saying or typing three words into the infotainment system.
Other companies are keen to follow Daimler’s lead. TomTom and ride-hailing services like Cabify recently announced plans to enable what3words navigation to precise locations.
And more could follow. The startup says it plans to use the investment from Sony to focus on more initiatives in the automotive space.","Sony’s venture capital arm has invested in what3words, the startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned a three-word address to each one.

Kirsten Korosec,"Ford is partnering with what3words to give drivers access to the startup’s novel addressing system.
Under the partnership, drivers will be able to connect to the free what3words app — on an iOS or Android device — to their vehicle via their SYNC 3 infotainment platform. Drivers can find the three-word address on website contact pages, guidebooks and business cards. Drivers can enter the addresses via voice or text input and receive directions through the vehicle’s navigation system.
The startup, founded in 2013, has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned three words to each one. Users of the what3words app, which is available in 26 languages, has been adopted by logistics, travel, automotive and humanitarian organizations because it provides exact locations anywhere in the world.
The system is used by Lonely Planet, which has rolled out three-word addresses for each of its listings, as well as Mercedes-Benz, ride-hailing app Cabify, the UN, Red Cross and TomTom.
The startup has also attracted an interesting mix of investors, most recently Sonys venture capital arm.

“We are more mobile than ever before, but with that comes its challenges. The growing traction that what3words is gaining within the automobility industry is a testament to how we are improving journeys and customer experiences,” CEO and co-founder Chris Sheldrick said.
What3words will initially be available to Ford owners in the U.K. and Ireland, Germany, Spain, the U.S. and Mexico. More markets and languages will follow later in the year.

Emily Price,"If you purchased the first version of Sony’s PlayStation 3, then you might be entitled to some cash. Back in the day when Sony launched the product, it tried to sell the gaming console as a “computer” as well, going as far as to say that you could install and run Linux on it. While technically a possibility, turns out it was also a security issue, so Sony ditched the feature through a firmware update. A few PlayStation buyers filed a class action lawsuit against the company, and it recently agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle the suit. The five main plaintiffs are each getting $3,500, and the remaining cash is being split amongst other PlayStation buyers, lawyers, and settlement organizers. What that means for you If you purchased the original PlayStation 3 (the “fat one) between November 1, 2006 and April 1, 2010 then you’re potentially entitled to some cash, CNET notes. You need to have made the purchase from an authorized PlayStation retailer in the United States to qualify, which means Craiglist and dorm room deals don’t qualify. You also have to claim you used the Other OS functionality and think your console lost value when Sony took that functionality away, and be willing to attest, under penalty of perjury those facts. To get your cash you’ll have to fill out this claim form and provide the serial number of your PS3 or your PlayStation Network Sign-In info that you use with the device or PlayStation Network Online ID.

Aimée Lutkin,"There are some skills you hope you never need to use, but having them could be a matter of life and death: welcome to bleeding control. BleedingControl.org, an group begun by the American College of Surgeons, has successfully campaigned for a national Stop The Bleed Day ; the organization believes that many lives could be saved if ordinary citizens had some basic information on how to stop traumatic bleeding in an emergency situation. Reporter and certified EMT Tim Mak rounded up the most critical points on the day dedicated to bleeding awareness in an effort to teach more people how to save lives. According to Mak, 20 percent of people who die from bleeding could have been saved with this care, and bleeding to death is the top cause of preventable death. Here’s what you need to know. When was the last time you took a first aid class? The ‘80s? ‘90s? Like everything in the medical… Read more Read What To Look For It is possible to bleed to death from smaller wounds, but people who bleed out often do so because they have cut an artery. You will know an artery has been severed if blood is spurting from the wound and bright red. Also, if blood is pooling, if the injured person is unconscious, or if you’re seeing a partial or full amputation. A person with a severed artery can die in 2-3 minutes. When somebody gets a traumatic injury like a gunshot, it’s often not the trauma itself that kills… Read more Read How To Intervene Mak provided a step-by-step guide which may seem simple, but in a scenario where someone is massively bleeding, you might be a little panicked. Simple rules help. First, make sure you’re not stepping into danger. Then, call 911. Even if you’re about to stop the bleeding successfully, you want trained medical professionals to get there ASAP. Then you find the injury and apply pressure to stop the blood loss. You may not have a tourniquet on hand, but if you do, tie it off between the blood flow and the exit wound, above the injury. If not, or if the wound is too big to be contained by a tourniquet, grab a clean cloth or hemostatic (bleeding control) gauze, if available. Pack the wound and hold it down with steady pressure. You’re trying to close off the artery and keep it closed until help can arrive. Mak advises people apply as much pressure as possible, because even if the injury is severe, the artery is fairly deep inside the body. You need to press hard to reach it and shut it off. Finally, if you have the presence of mind to do so, mark the time the tourniquet or pressure was applied. This is useful information for medical professionals, as there are dangers to leaving tourniquets on too long. These are the basics, but if you want to take a hands on class for free, Bleeding Control offers them all over the country.

Chris Welch,"Google’s March security update for Pixel phones also includes some much-needed functional improvements for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, as noted by Android Police. The company seems to have heard complaints from users about its latest phones becoming sluggish over time — especially the camera app. This month’s update promises to improve startup times and general responsiveness for the Pixel 3’s camera app. The March update also “improves storage performance on Pixel 3 devices,” meaning Google has been able to further optimize read and write speeds for the phone’s flash storage. Someone posted screenshots comparing storage performance before and after the update, and it does seem like a nice improvement. Both of those fixes are needed. Some owners have grown displeased with the Pixel 3’s inconsistent user experience several months after launch. Droid Life went off on the phone last month. And in his latest video, MKBHD detailed some of the frustrations he’s faced when using the Pixel 3. “I’ve had all kinds of various lag and performance issues with this Pixel after a couple of months,” he said. Google’s decision to give the devices just 4GB of RAM continues to draw criticism; many Android phones had already moved to 6GB or 8GB at the time the Pixel 3 launched, and the new Galaxy S10 can be purchased with up to 12GB RAM. Google fixed some of the worst early issues, like audio apps unexpectedly closing in the background. Not everyone is running into these problems — my own review device works about as well as I expect — but there are also others: Google has yet to completely fix a “screen flash” bug that makes the display brightly flash white when accessing the lock screen. But the camera fix is important, as the most notable thing about Google’s phone continues to be its best-in-class shooter. Back to this latest update: Google says it “improves Bluetooth reliability” on Pixel 3 and 3 XL. But Bluetooth seems to be a confounding technology for this company at times — just ask Pixelbook and Pixel Slate owners — so keep your expectations in check. And last, the March security update improves the recovery process if an OTA update fails, and it “improves playback of encrypted media on some video apps.” All of these improvements only apply to the Pixel 3, with no mention of the Pixel 2 or original Pixel. To download the March update, just head to settings, check for an update, and the installation process should begin automatically.","Google’s March security update for Pixel phones also includes some much-needed functional improvements for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, including faster startup speeds for the camera app.",2019-03-04T22:28:11Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Google tries to address complaints of sluggish Pixel 3 with latest update,https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250583/google-pixel-3-march-update-camera-storage-fixes,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGzjC-VaKQpfmsvc_3wz-fjpYYM=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13278387/jbareham_181010_2989_0217.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-3,1
Emily Price,"About 4 months ago, the left Shift button on my MacBook randomly stopped working. I use my computer for work and couldn’t really afford to be without it, so now I’ve developed some right pinkie muscles I didn’t know I ever had, and trained myself to use the Shift button the right side of my keyboard instead. When the problem began, I thought the issue was due to something I must have done to my computer. I hadn’t spilled anything on it and had been pretty diligent about not eating and drinking next to it since the “beer incident of 2016” when I totaled my last MacBook 100% sober with an entire IPA. But clearly, I must have done something to make this key fail.

Friday Apple acknowledged an issue with certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models where letters characters repeat unexpectedly, do not appear, or key(s) “feel ‘sticky’ or do not respond in a consistent manner.” You might have heard about the issue from this class action lawsuit. The best part: If you’re having one of those issues with your MacBook, and it’s one of the models they’ve confirmed the issue with, you can get it fixed for free. The eligible models include: ▪MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015) ▪MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016) ▪MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017) ▪MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016) ▪MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017) If you have one of those models and are having keyboard woes, you can get your keyboard fixed for free at an Apple Retail Store, Apple Authorized Service Provider, or you can mail your device into an Apple Repair Center. Before your keyboard gets fixed they’ll first confirm that the issue is due to a defect and not you’re pouring a beer all over your computer. If you do have to get it fixed, it’s going to be a multi-day affair, so you should back up your computer’s data beforehand (you should be doing that anyway) and be prepared to be sans computer for a few days. If you’re like me and you’ve already created a workaround, you also have four years from your original purchase date to get the fix done, so you can pick a time that’s convenient for you. If you’ve already paid to have a repair done you can also contact Apple about getting a refund.

Stan Schroeder,"Tesla's Model 3 may be slow out of the factory, but the top model will be quick on the road. That's according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted some performance figures for the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive, performance version of the Model 3, and they're pretty darn impressive. SEE ALSO: Behold, the Tesla iPhone X complete with solar panel charging That particular variant of the car will go from 0-60mph in 3.5 seconds, with a 155mph top speed and a 310 mile range. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec 0-60mph 155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 20, 2018 That's not as quick as the quickest Model S variant, the P100D, which goes from 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds and has a 315 mile range (top speed is the same at 155mph), but it's pretty darn impressive for a car marketed as a small affordable sedan. Unfortunately, in that variant the Model 3 definitely stops being affordable. Musk says it'll cost $78,000 (with all options sans Autopilot), comparing it to a BMW M3, only faster and with better handling. ""(It) will beat anything in its class on the track,"" Musk tweeted. Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling.

The range on that variant will also be 310 miles, but the 0-60mph time will be 4.5 seconds and the top speed will be 140mph. Musk also explained that on a Tesla, a dual motor really means two motors, one in front and one in the rear, with one being optimized for power, and the other for range. ""Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down,"" he tweeted. The Model 3 production has hit a series of roadblocks since the car was launched a year ago, but lately the company has been able to produce the car at decent volumes. In April, Tesla was producing 2,270 Model 3 cars per week, and Musk said he hopes to increase that number to 5,000 by July.","Tesla's Model 3 may be slow out of the factory, but the top model will be quick on the road.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"The open letter is just one example of this deception. The bill’s defenders frequently say some version of, “We need tax reform.” But their plan bears little resemblance to meaningful tax reform. It’s akin to telling someone, “You need a new car,” and then giving the person a lemon. (For those who want more detail on the open letter, Jason Furman walks through its distortions in more detail.) 2. Talk about the plan’s middle-class tax cuts — and ignore the middle-class tax increases. The plan is a windfall for the wealthy, but it’s quite mixed for the middle class and poor. Some provisions raise taxes on the middle class and poor. Others cut taxes. Long term, most families would probably be worse off, as I’ve explained before. One favorite sleight of hand from the plan’s supporters is to talk only about the provisions that help the middle class and conveniently fail to mention the other parts. Take Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican, who went on “Meet the Press” this weekend to sell the bill. “The middle class tax cuts are in there,” Portman said. “It doubles the standard deduction up to 24 grand for a family. It doubles the child tax credit. It actually — it lowers the rates.” All that is true. Unfortunately, Senator Portman left out the elimination of the personal exemption, which protects $4,000 per person from income taxes. He left out the elimination of various tax breaks that help the middle class. And he left out the introduction of a new inflation measure that will push more families into higher tax brackets over time. 3. Pretend that the future will never arrive. To hold down the estimated cost of the bill, Senate leaders have set some of its biggest provisions — the ones that most benefit the middle class — to expire over the next decade. The corporate tax cuts, by contrast, are permanent. But when the plan’s defenders describe the bill, they tend to be talking about a point before the bill is fully implemented — without admitting as much. If you hear a senator talking about a $1,000 tax cut that a typical middle-class family would receive, it’s in one of the plan’s early years. (If you hear a senator talking about a bigger tax cut, as Portman and many others do, they’re usually talking about the upper middle class or affluent without saying so.) By the time the bill is fully implemented, it will be a net tax increase on every income group below $75,000 a year. It will also leave federal taxes virtually unchanged for families making between $75,000 and $100,000. For the wealthy, it’s still a tax cut. And all of these estimates understate the long-term damage to the middle class, because they ignore the cuts to education, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that will eventually be necessary to reduce the deficit. 4. Rush, rush, rush. Perhaps the biggest giveaway about the plan is the way that its supporters are trying to push it through Congress as quickly as possible. They’re not holding hearings where experts can debate the content of the plan. They are not even waiting for a final analysis from Congress’s official tax arbiter, the Joint Committee on Taxation. They understand that facts and debate hurt their cause. They are hoping that partisan loyalty is strong enough to overcome substance. Related. “If the tax bill is so great,” Catherine Rampell asked in a recent Washington Post column, “why does the GOP keep lying about it?” “Why would anyone write a bill full of provisions that evaporate over time?” Paul Krugman asks. “There’s no economic or policy logic behind it. Instead, it’s all about trying to have it both ways, making a safe space for political double talk.” Poll after poll has shown that the tax plan is deeply unpopular, typically with a national approval rating around 30 percent. Three new polls show that the plan is similarly unpopular in Arizona, Maine and Tennessee, three states with swing-vote senators. In fact, it’s not clear any piece of legislation so unpopular has ever before become law, as Seth Hanlon notes. The failed Roy Moore scam. A conservative group tried to entrap some Washington Post reporters while peddling a fake story about Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate with a history of pursuing teenage girls. The scam failed, and you can watch it fail on video. In The Times, Bari Weiss argues that the incident is a reminder of the limits of “believe all women.” Continue reading the main story","Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, has touted the Trump tax plan’s middle-class tax cuts — but ignored its middle-class tax increases.",2017-11-28T13:31:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Four Big Tax Deceptions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/opinion/republican-tax-plan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/28/opinion/28leonhardt-newsletter-portman/28leonhardt-newsletter-portman-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1
LISA FRIEDMAN,"The documents he reviewed weren’t publicly released with the letter, he said, in order to protect any current security efforts that may be in effect. But, he added, “Another view is that certain factions within E.P.A. have justified the exorbitant taxpayer spending incurred by the Administrator’s first-class travel and large entourage of security personnel through unsubstantiated claims about threats to his security, either at the direction of the Administrator himself or others in the agency.” The Associated Press reported last week that Mr. Pruitt has spent about $3 million on security, a figure confirmed by The New York Times. That amount includes travel and overtime pay for Mr. Pruitt’s round-the-clock detail of security officers. The E.P.A. could not be immediately reached for comment on the senator’s letter. Mr. Pruitt has been under fire in recent weeks for reports that he rented a condo for $50 a night from the wife of a lobbyist with business before his agency, spent at least $120,000 in taxpayer-funded first-class travel, and retaliated against staff members who questioned his spending and the need for a security force more than three times the size of past administrators. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the agency, has in the past cited the E.P.A. inspector general’s office, which has noted death threats against the administrator and his family. “Americans should all agree that members of the President’s cabinet should be kept safe from these violent threats,” Mr. Wilcox said last week.

Kate Conger,"A federal judge in California has ruled that a class action lawsuit against Yahoo related to a series of data breaches at the company can move forward. Verizon, which bought Yahoo last year for a reduced price of about $4.5 billion, had asked the judge to dismiss many of the lawsuit’s claims. Yahoo users have claimed that the repeat security incidents at the company, and Yahoo’s delayed disclosure of those incidents, exposed them to identity theft and forced them to spend extra money and time securing their personal information. Last fall, Yahoo tripled its initial estimate of the number of user accounts impacted by the breaches from 1 billion to 3 billion. Yahoo has admitted that hackers stole users’ passwords and accessed Yahoo’s internal codebase, which enabled them to forge cookies used to log in to user accounts without a password and to manipulate Yahoo search results. The plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit claim that they would have chosen another email service if they had been informed sooner of Yahoo’s security woes—a claim that U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh found credible. “Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to show that they would have behaved differently had defendants disclosed the security weaknesses of the Yahoo Mail System,” Koh wrote. In March, the Justice Department announced charges against several Russians and one Canadian citizen linked to the Yahoo hacks. Karim Baratov, the Canadian accused of helping orchestrate the breaches, pleaded guilty in November.

Kirsten Korosec,"What3words, a startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned three words to each one, has disclosed three new investors all from the automotive world. What3words announced Thursday that the venture arm of China’s largest auto group SAIC Motor, Formula 1 champion Nico Rosberg, and audio and navigation systems company Alpine Electronics have invested in the London-based company. Existing investor Intel Capital also participated in the round. The latest funding round will be used to expand into new markets and product developments. The investment, which was not disclosed, illustrates interest in the industry for technology that simplifies the user experience in cars, can be easily used with voice commands, and prepares companies for the age of autonomous vehicles. Since, the addressing system gives a unique three-word combination to a location it fixes a major flaw with a lot of voice-operated navigation systems: duplicate street names. The company has assigned these 57 trillion squares a unique three-word name using an algorithm that has a vocabulary of 25,000 words. The system, which anyone can use via the what3words app, is available in more than a dozen languages. For instance, if you want to meet a friend in a specific corner of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you can send the three-word address prices.slippery.traps. An Airbnb host might use a three word address to direct a guest to a tricky entrance. Someday, riders might be able to say or type in a three-word address to direct a self-driving car to drop them off a specific entrance at a large sports arena. “This fund raise cements the direction this company is going,” What3words CEO Chris Sheldrick told TechCrunch. “Which is how, in the future, we are going to tell cars and devices and voice assistants where we’re going.” Earlier this year, what3words disclosed that Daimler had taken 10% stake in the company. Daimler’s stake and these recently revealed investors are all part of its Series C funding round. The company’s novel global addressing system has been integrated into in Mercedes’ new infotainment and navigation system—called the Mercedes-Benz User Experience or MBUX. The MBUX debuted on the new Mercedes A-Class, a hatchback that went on sale outside the U.S. in the spring. A sedan variant of the A-Class will come to the U.S. market in late 2018. TomTom also announced plans last month to integrate what3words into its mapping and navigation products in the second half of this year. TomTom supplies its automotive navigation and traffic technology to car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Citroën and Peugeot. The company is in talks with other automakers and suppliers to get what3words integrated into vehicle infotainment systems.","What3words, a startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned three words to each one, has disclosed three new investors all from the automotive world.

Allison Jones,"TORONTO -- Ontario is considering removing caps on class sizes in kindergarten and in Grades 1 to 3 as the Progressive Conservative government tackles a multi-billion-dollar deficit.
Education Minister Lisa Thompson announced Wednesday that she is launching consultations with education partners on class sizes and teacher-hiring practices.
Currently, the kindergarten class size cap is 29 students, and the average of class sizes across any board can't be more than 26. For the primary grades the cap is 23 students, but at least 90 per cent of classes in any board must have 20 or fewer students.
A government consultation document poses questions such as whether hard caps on class sizes should continue, and if they were removed, what would be an appropriate way to set effective class sizes.
""The province's current fiscal circumstances require an examination of whether changes to class size would allow school boards to deliver better value for government investment,"" the document says, noting that educator staffing costs make up about 80 per cent of government funding to school boards.
Sam Hammond, the president of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, said in a meeting with government officials Wednesday, the officials made it clear they need to work toward balancing the budget.
""Given that, they're going to have to make some difficult decisions and there's no doubt that some of those decisions are going to affect publicly funded education,"" Hammond said, adding that moving from hard caps to a system based on averages ""would be an absolute disaster.""
The government document says the ministry has heard in previous talks that implementing hard caps on class sizes is expensive and difficult for school boards to manage.
""It has been suggested that board-wide class size averages offer more flexibility for classroom organization and allows for more efficient use of board funds,"" the document says.
The consultations are also looking at changes to teacher-hiring practices.
The Tories are in the midst of trying to trim a deficit they peg at $14.5 billion -- though the financial accountability officer says it's closer to $12 billion.
Hammond thinks Wednesday's meeting and consultation is a harbinger of both what's to come in the budget for education, and negotiations that are to start this year ahead of teacher contracts expiring in August.
The previous Liberal government negotiated the last round of teacher and education worker contracts as two-year extensions to existing deals, which ensured they wouldn't have to contend with heated teacher bargaining ahead of the 2018 election.
That deal for elementary teachers came with $56 million to hire teachers and early childhood educators so the current kindergarten cap could be implemented.
Under the existing contracts, high school, elementary, English Catholic and French teachers, as well as support staff, got four per cent salary increases over the two years.
They also got a one-time payment for professional development, supplies and equipment equivalent to a 0.5-per-cent salary increase.",Ontario considers removing caps on kindergarten and primary class sizes CTV News Ontario is considering removing caps on class sizes in kindergarten and in Grades 1 to 3 as the Progressive Conservative government tackles a...

Leigh Anderson,"Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold! For some people, the first freeze of winter is doubly depressing—we’re close to the shortest day of the year, which means we’re not getting a good dose of sunlight, and it’s too cold to go outside and get some exercise and fresh air. But don’t despair! Winter can be a season for hibernation, sure, but if you’re clever and plan ahead, you won’t necessarily start climbing the walls. This AskMetafilter question was posted by a user with mobility issues who hates the forced confinement of freezing temps, and commenters chimed in with many useful suggestions on how to weather the winter with one’s good spirits intact. Below are the indoor-entertainment possibilities that resonated the most with me, but definitely check out the whole thread for even more ideas. 1. Deal with your house In my family, the run-up to Christmas causes me a certain amount of mild anxiety. I know a deluge of new gifts for my kids is coming, and it feels like that water level in our cramped apartment is rising. So take a few evenings or a weekend and cull your closets, shelves, and that pile of stuff by the door (we all have one). Or redecorate a room or sew some new pillow covers or build a bookcase. I know that nothing makes me feel more accomplished than painting a room and hauling a load of stuff to the Good Will. Sprucing up your living space provides a sense of satisfaction; it also just...spruces up your living space. Which is nice when you’re trapped there. For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read 2. Get active for a cause Is the current political environment making you antsy? Do you want to use your time to help other people? You’re not alone. And even if you can’t go door-to-door and attend meetings, you can still do a lot of good work online or on your phone. VolunteerMatch will help you find volunteer opportunities in fields that interest you, and you can filter the results by “virtual opportunities.” (Note—it doesn’t filter perfectly, so you have to read carefully. But there are still lots of chances to help out with web design or admin support for organizations getting off the ground.) If you already have a favorite nonprofit or political candidate, contact them directly and ask how you can help from home. 3. Get completist about a subject This winter I want to learn to play a certain fiddle tune on the guitar in all 12 keys. Will I actually complete it? I doubt it. But by April I might make it through four keys, which is still better than the zero keys I know it in now. I’m also planning a personal mini-class on the Civil War, complete with the Ken Burns documentary and a few thick books already on my nightstand. By the spring I’ll basically have a Ph.D. 4. Host Make people trudge through the snow to you. Put on a pot of stew, bake some bread, and break out the whiskey. How do you think that people in cold climates stay social? Winter is back, and it's colder than ever. Coupled with snow, dry air, sickness, and… Read more Read 5. Get a penpal Postcrossing is something I’ve never heard of, but it seems to be a way to have short correspondences, via postcard, with people all over the world. There are also sites that will match you with more traditional pen pals (check this post out for safety tips before you start). 6. Take an online class Want to bone up on your art history, your calculus, your knife technique? Google around for virtual instruction in whatever subject is grabbing you. I’d probably try some kind of write-your-novel class that would force me to turn in a certain number of pages each week, but there’s obviously a huge range of subjects to choose from. If you live in a snowy place and you don’t have a hot water bottle at the foot of your bed, I’m… Read more Read 7. Proofread Project Gutenberg needs proofreaders for their scanned books. You get to read and help distribute great works of literature at the same time! And of course there are the old cold-weather standbys, like cooking, crafting, and playing music, and the new cold-weather standbys, like video games and social media. Do you have a novel way of getting through a hard winter without losing your mind?

Jack Stewart,"If you've seen old-timey photos of aviation in the early decades of the jet age and wondered where all the glamour went, you've been flying economy. When airlines change the back of the plane, it's usually to pack in more passengers or install something you can give them money to enjoy. For those who turn left as they board, life aloft is swankier than ever. But last week at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, economy fliers got a bit of good, if not quite glamorous, news. One of the world's largest plane builders, Airbus, and cabin builder Zodiac Aerospace are going to start building beds for hire. Full-size, lay-out-flat beds—no business or first-class ticket required. In an environment as cramped as a plane cabin, Zodiac's designers had to go downstairs, into the cargo hold, to find extra space. Airlines buying certain planes from Airbus will soon be able to order new “passenger modules,” the exact size and shape of a cargo container. They can slot them into the belly of large planes, just like they load your luggage, in a large metal bin. They can also pull them out again for shorter flights or when they need more cargo space. Inside, these modules look like a cross between an old fashioned sleeper train and an upscale, minimalist hostel. The surfaces are all finished in glossy white, with subtle lighting along the ceiling and floor. It looks like curtains could be added for privacy. This place isn't for the claustrophobic: There are no windows, and the beds are narrow and stacked two high. Putting people in the cargo hold (which, yes, is heated) isn’t as crazy or as novel as it sounds. Large airliners like the A330 and A380 already have bunks downstairs, where crew members can rest on long flights. On the A380 super-jumbo, the bunks are stacked three high, and accessed via a steep set of space-saving stairs. Boeing typically tucks its crew beds in a narrow space above the passenger compartment, with a ladder hidden behind what looks like a bathroom door. Pilots often have their own beds too, either in the cockpit or nearby. These spaces are always a little cramped, but still offer the allure of lying down flat. So it makes sense that Airbus thinks its airline customers will want to make more beds available to more people, for a price. Airbus says they’ll be aimed at economy-class passengers, who would still have to spend takeoff and landing in a regular seat—the sort that's been through extensive crash testing. But during a flight, fliers could rent a bunk, presumably for less than the price of a lie-flat business-class seat, and get some proper rest. On very long flights of 12 hours or more, airlines could rent them for half a flight, change the bedding, and then give someone else a chance. If the concept works, and airlines find ways to use the bunks to make money without robbing too much cargo space, bunks could be just the beginning. Airbus also showed plans for a lounge, a conference room, a medical suite, and a kids play zone, all to be slotted into the cargo hold. One day, the entire plane could feature swappable modules instead of permanent, regular seats. Airbus’ Silicon Valley outpost, A 3, tested hot-swappable cabin module concepts with cafés or spin-class bikes inside. But putting those into production would require extensive modifications to the whole airframe. Singapore Airlines is experimenting with removing partitions between its fancy suites, to create a double-bed, for the super wealthy. To begin, Airbus will offer the sleeper pods for its A330 widebody jet, typically used for medium- to long-haul routes with more than 300 passengers. Airbus says because the bunk system uses the plane’s existing cargo rails, it could be in operation by 2019. By aviation standards, in which planes take a decade or more to design, produce, and test, that's remarkably quick. Other intriguing ideas from the Aircraft Interiors Expo include Boeing's lavatory floor concept, made of super absorbent material, to keep things as dry and un-gross as possible. Zodiac also took a crack at the bathroom, offering up a urinal, two of which could be squeezed into the space of one regular bathroom. That could cut queues, and is an inadvertent throwback to those glamour days— Boeing's famed Clipper also had onboard urinals. So maybe you won't get to fly upfront, where new offerings could include double beds and family dining spaces. But maybe you'll at least be able to lie down, get comfortable, and dream up something more glamorous.

JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"Was it? Roseanne Barr the performer is pro-Trump; so is Roseanne the character. But “Roseanne” the show was less pro-Trump than pro-Roseanne, working to assure the audience that, whether you thought she was right or wrong, she meant well. Her argument with Jackie, for instance, mostly sidestepped questions of racism, or xenophobia, or Mr. Trump’s dog-whistle nostalgia for “the old days.” Instead, she said that Mr. Trump (though not mentioned by name on the show) “talked about jobs.” Was that the only reason she voted for him? I don’t know. But I 100 percent believe that’s what she would say her motivation was. People sell themselves, all the time, on the most charitable interpretations of their actions. But the following week’s episode had an offhand line that suggested there was a kind of white-identity politics under the surface here. The Conners woke up in front of the TV, having slept through, Dan said, “all the shows about black and Asian families.” (The reference was to “black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat,” the only two such sitcoms on ABC.) “They’re just like us,” Roseanne said. “There, now you’re all caught up.” The line felt like a sarcastic slap. Ms. Barr defended it on Twitter as “ a joke about class solidarity.” If so, it was a weird one because 1) both of the referenced shows are about more affluent families; 2) if Ms. Barr knows how to do one thing, it’s to make sure you know sarcasm when she delivers it; and 3) if the line were about class solidarity, it would be … not really a joke but simply a statement. The season’s seventh episode left less ambiguity. In “Go, Cubs!” Roseanne met her new Muslim neighbors, who she was afraid are terrorists. The publicity for the episode emphasized that Ms. Barr wanted her character to get a “comeuppance” for her prejudice.","The sitcom’s revival was a topical hit, but the political pot-stirring — onscreen and off — overshadowed the show’s strengths.",2018-05-23T00:31:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Critic’s Notebook: It Was ‘Roseanne’ vs. ‘Roseanne,’ in a Polarizing Revival",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/arts/television/roseanne-season-finale-roseanne-barr.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/arts/television/23roseanne-2/23roseanne-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1

Darrell Etherington,"PepsiCo is the latest company to reveal that it’s placed orders for Tesla’s forthcoming electric semi-truck – and also the company with the largest order so far. The beverage company has ordered 100 of the trucks per Reuters, meaning it’s placed at least a $20,000 deposit for each of those since Tesla rose the downpayment amount for its original $5,000 starting point. PepsiCo is actually the second large beverage concern this week to announce its intent to purchase some of Tesla’s all-electric Class 8 heavy duty towing vehicles; Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch revealed earlier that it has put down money for 40 Tesla Semis. Tesla is seeing a lot of pre-order interest already, from major fleet operators including Walmart, Canadian grocery chain Loblaws and many more. The amounts are, however, at most in the double digits (barring this 100 unit order from PepsiCo), which represents just a small fraction of the total fleets operated by each (Pespi runs over 10,000 trucks, for instance). Those volumes are big for Tesla, which is new to making trucks and will have to wade through a lot of “production hell” (as Elon Musk termed the current Model 3 production ramp) to get to a place where it can make a lot of the trucks quickly. But they’re also essentially just pilots for these retailers. Pilots at this number of large shippers without even a production vehicle under their belt is definitely a good sign, however, regardless of how you look at it.","PepsiCo is the latest company to reveal that it’s placed orders for Tesla’s forthcoming electric semi-truck – and also the company with the largest order so far.

Anthony Ha,"Fitness-oriented New Yorkers aren’t facing a shortage of classes that they can sign up for, but the prices can add up — Clément Benoit, founder of a new startup called FitHouse, said boutique classes cost an average of $35 per session. FitHouse, on the other hand, is charging $99 per month for unlimited classes. Contrast that not just with a traditional studio, but also with ClassPass, where pricing in NYC ranges from $45 (for two to four classes) to $135 (for eight to 12 classes) per month. In many ways, FitHouse offers a more traditional model than ClassPass — instead of giving subscribers access to a classes run by other studios and instructors, it’s is building a studio of its own. Benoit said this gives the company more control over the experience, and bigger piece of the revenue, which he said “we redistribute to both the user and the instructors.” Beyond the pricing, Benoit said FitHouse also stands out because of its approach to real estate. It’s looking to take over empty spaces that require a minimum amount of investment to make them ready for classes. And it’s signing six-month leases with the possibility of a longer-term extension, so that it can quickly spin up new locations in new neighborhoods, with a minimum of risk. FitHouse has already opened its first location in New York’s Bowery neighborhood, with plans to launch 12 locations across the city over the next year. Clément Benoit Benoit also said he’s attracting the best instructors by putting them front-and-center in FitHouse’s marketing and scheduling, and by paying them 10 to 25 percent more than they’d normally make to teach a class. (Though to be clear, these instructors aren’t working with FitHouse exclusively.) Benoit, by the way, is a tech entrepreneur who sold his last-mile delivery startup Stuart to GeoPost last year. (And he’s already raised a $3 million round from Global Founders Capital, Xavier Niel and Fabrice Grinda.) He admitted that FitHouse’s technology isn’t the most flashy part of the offering, but he said it’s still important that the startup created its own frontend and backend infrastructure. “Just the fact that we have information on the user, we can deliver a personalized check in: You came last week, you had a great class with this instructor, how did you like it?” he said. “No studio does that. They don’t control the tech.”","Fitness-oriented New Yorkers aren’t facing a shortage of classes that they can sign up for, but the prices can add up — Clément Benoit, founder of a new startup called FitHouse, said boutique classes cost an average of $35 per session.

Plus, it’s always nice to be nice and make things easier for your instructors. We asked several fitness professionals what they wish their clients knew going in and this is what they said. To be a better customer—or at least one that’s not too annoying—it helps to know what it’s like… Read more Read Trainers Aren’t Going to Make You Exercise Several fitness pros expressed that it’s not their job to make you exercise. They’re supposed to guide you through workouts that are right for you, teach you how to do exercise safely and properly, and develop a meal plan that will help you reach your fitness goals. One fitness pro, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that a lot of people go to the gym, but most of those gymgoers don’t know what they’re doing: The Dunning-Kruger Effect seems particularly strong in the gym, probably because of all the ego involved. So many people don’t know what they’re doing, and they have no idea this is the case. Others know enough to see decent progress, but they could be doing better. A personal trainer can at least jump start a beginner’s knowledge and give them resources to move forward. Gym-goers waste a lot of time with bad advice and poor sources, or trying to reinvent the wheel. It’s all about imbuing you with knowledge you can use to better yourself when they’re not around. The hard work has be done by you, not your instructor, says Anthony T., a fitness trainer from Oakland, CA: You don’t pay a trainer to have fun. If anyone knows your journey isn’t easy it’s your trainer, and they didn’t become one overnight. So leave the excuses in your bed. Positive and inspirational energy is the key. Another anonymous instructor agreed, saying: Don’t blame your lack of success on me. You meet with me once a week for 1 hour a week. There are 168 hours in a week. That means that if you really want to make progress you have to do things correctly 167 other hours of the week. Don’t come kill it in the gym with me then go home and eat a whole pizza and drink a bottle of wine and complain that I am not a good trainer. Nobody is going to make you exercise, not even your trainer, so don’t expect them to have some magic ability to get you motivated. Our February push-up challenge ends today! How did the month go for you? What can you do now that… Read more Read You Should Do Research and Shop Around for a Good Fit When you’re looking for a trainer, don’t just sign up with the first person to give you a free session. Michael Borders, a personal trainer at Equinox in New York, NY, says you should find someone who can help you achieve your specific goal: I believe we all could use a different perspective on our fitness goals and be held accountable to someone else—not just our own opinion of what we can and cannot, should and should not be doing in the gym. YouTube is full of BAD info. Shop around, but find a trainer who is passionate about getting you to your goal, whatever it may be. But several fitness pros cautioned that you should do in-depth research on certain trainers before signing up with them. One anonymous trainer pointed out that almost anyone can get a certification: The personal trainer certification is not a rigorous process. There are many certified trainers who have little business instructing others. Some do the bare minimum to pass the test, and then don’t further their education beyond that. Other trainers have a passion for this and they read a ton. It’s important for potential clients to know what to look for in a trainer. Some are very good and knowledgeable, others spread misinformation and taint the industry. Allison Perry seconds those words of caution: Good, knowledgeable fitness instructors are hard to find. There are a LOT of people out there with little to no training (or who flat-out ignore their training recommendations) teaching fitness classes. A lot of gyms don’t even require an audition, or the audition process is a joke. Do some investigating for yourself and find out what qualifications the gym’s instructors have. At the bare minimum, your instructors should have an AFAA or ACE certification as a base, and then any specialty trainings that correspond to what they are teaching. AFAA and ACE also require ongoing continuing education in order to remain current in the certification. However, she goes on to say that a lot of popular specialty fitness certifications are a joke. All they require is that you show to an 8-hour class, so keep that mind when a trainer starts bragging to you about all of their certifications. And if you’re checking out classes, Perry offers some useful advice: Pay attention to how a class is structured. Does the instructor seem organized? Does the music work with the format? Are you getting enough cues? Is the workout balanced (e.g., are you working opposing muscle groups, is the instructor allowing for adequate recovery between sets, etc)? If you try a class and didn’t care for it, consider giving it a go with another instructor. They may have a different personality, music, cues, etc that change the game for you. Last but not least, a few trainers mentioned that a trainer who looks amazing isn’t always the best option. You’re probably better off with someone who is knowledgable and has gone through the same struggles as you. Bouncing on a trampoline is undeniably fun, but how well does that translate to an exercise class?… Read more Read Don’t Be Late to Your Appointments or Classes This should be obvious, but many trainers expressed late clients as their biggest pet peeve. Here’s what one anonymous trainer had to say: For the love of everything, show up on time to your appointment. Good trainers have a plan, and showing up 15 minutes late can throw a wrench into that. Or, at least let us know you’re going to be late. Nothing like a client showing up late and then expecting an hour session crammed into 45 minutes. There is a method to the madness and it doesn’t work like that. Perry echoes those sentiments: Really, I know shit happens, but try not to be late, especially for formats that require setup. For example, if you’ve never taken a Spinning class and you are about to walk in 5-10 minutes late, just skip, make plans for next time, and try to get there early — properly setting up your bike is a process that takes a few minutes and will prevent you from injuring your joints with a bad setup. Anthony T. notes that being late is really only hurting you: When you are late, unprepared, or reschedule often. You’re wasting your own time, money and progress. At the end of the day this whole process is a test of your mental way more than A test of your body. We want to repeat the things to you that will manifest successful thinking. Budget plenty of travel time, leave early, and be ready to roll come training time. Manage Your Expectations Going in It’s great that you want to make a change for the better and be healthier, but it’s a process—and not an easy one. Anthony Ross, an Army Master Fitness trainer, explains: People need to come prepared when they want to work out. I don’t mean that they should have a towel, a trendy water bottle, and some yoga pants. I mean that you have to train your heart and your mind to UNDERSTAND that working out is going to suck for a little while if you haven’t done it in a long time, or if you have never done it. People tell me it’s hard, they are telling me like this is news. No shit! Of course it’s hard, I have to do this every single day, I know it’s hard. Not only is it difficult, but personal trainer Andrew Biernat from Canandaigua, NY, says it will take longer to reach your goals than you think: I wish people knew that the work they put in will fall far short of their expected results. I’d estimate that it takes five to ten times more work to get a result than people think. A person will make a change in their lifestyle and expect that to show up on the scale within a week. When it doesn’t they start to lose hope in the whole process. People can be very fragile when it comes to discomfort, especially when it comes to food and exercise. Biernat recommends you lower your expectations going in and learn to enjoy the process and the challenge. If you make yourself hate your new workout regimen and diet, you won’t do it. Rances Perez, of VIDAproject, agrees: In my opinion, the biggest thing that a person can understand before beginning is that training is a process with a learning curve. Many people start with very grandiose expectations of themselves and when the difficulty sets in—whether it’s the actual exercising, the obstacles of life, or both—they end up feeling horrible and defeated. The key is taking everything one step at a time and not trying to make drastic changes all at once. Stay positive, but keep your goals realistic. Don’t walk up to your trainer on day one and tell them you want washboard abs. You’ll only be disappointed. If you only do one of the sports in a triathlon—swimming, cycling, or running—you’re safe for now.… Read more Read It Might Look Like an Easy Job, But It’s Not From the outside, being a fitness trainer or class instructor looks like a pretty simple gig, right? Not so much. It’s a job, just like any other, and it takes a lot of work to do it right. At the very least, Anthony Ross asks you do your trainer the kindness of listening to what they say and following their instructions: Listen to your trainer, they may not always look like some dude from Baywatch, but they are a trainer for a reason. They know things that you don’t, so let them do their thing. Also, be aware that personal training is more than just showing up and watching you exercise. Andrew Biernat explains that they’re watching you for a reason: As a trainer, I need to know the body very well and be ready to correct something at a moment’s notice based on the way it looks, almost like a spider-sense. And that’s the easy part compared to the psychological deep dive of motivating and encouraging people to do hard work consistently. Also, they’re working for you when you’re not even there, says Scott Drapeau of Irons Sight Barbell Club in Lacey, WA: I’d like them all to know how much effort is put in behind the scenes. For every hour I spend training, I spend at least 3 more preparing notes, scheduling workouts, and making sure what you’re doing is safe and effective for your goals. So don’t ignore that effort your trainer is putting in, says Anthony T.: Yes, it can take hours to plan a perfect routine and meal plan, so don’t waste our efforts behind the scenes on distractions. Trust the process you’ll be happy you did. Lastly, Allison Perry says if you enjoyed a class or session, let your trainer or instructor know. Being a fitness professional is often a thankless job because people assume it’s easy to do. Be Honest With Your Trainers and Instructors You might be embarrassed by your physical ability, diet, or lifestyle choices, but lying to your instructors about that stuff won’t help you get healthier, says Anthony T.: We can’t train liars, and of course we can tell. If you have been sticking to your nutrition plan and fitness routine there’s no reason other than extreme stress for not achieving the steps to your goals each week. It’s my job to be critical and change your perception of your life when it comes to your health. Trainers don’t wake up to be mean to you. We’re actually Nice people who aren’t afraid to speak truthfully about your progress. We wake up to inspire you and locate that part of you that turns off excuses and starts finding solutions. If you’re new to all of this, don’t be afraid to say so, even in a class environment. Perry recommends you have a chat with your instructor before class so they know you’re new and might need some help. Ross agrees: If you don’t know how to do an exercise, or what an exercise is doing for you: ASK!!! It’s also important to be upfront with trainers about what you’re comfortable with. If you prefer to have them not manually adjust you while you exercise, let them know. And don’t hesitate to give your trainer a call, says Anthony T.: You can call your trainer anytime to vent, ask for health and fitness advice, or get motivation when you feel like it’s getting crazy. I’m even willing to think of a meal alternative to order if you got weak and pulled into a drive-thru. When in doubt, be honest and talk to them. This one is for the beasts out there.

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties. Because each attendee would often bring a case of whatever cheap lager they favored, I would often find my many bottles and cans of beer I didn’t really want to drink strewn across my apartment the next morning. (I mean, I drank it, but I wish I would have made some beer pickles too.) It’s Freshman Orientation Week at Lifehacker! This week, we’re covering ways to snap out of your summer haze and into an autumnal blitz of activity, whether you’re actually heading to campus for the first time, getting your own kids ready for school, or looking for ways to just be more productive in the classroom of life. So velcro up your Trapper Keepers, students. Class is now in session. You’re most likely already aware that beer makes a great deglazing liquid, but you may not be familiar with its pickling prowess. Using it to season and preserve vegetables is a great way to use up any beer you may not feel like drinking. (Just kidding. I know you guys always feel like drinking all the beer, but these pickles really are good.) The brine is simple enough—it’s beer, vinegar, salt and sugar, plus whatever other flavorful friends you want to add. I’ve used this brine to pickle both onions and corn, and both were delightfully sweet and sour and infused with just a touch of debauchery. To make it yourself, you will need: Your produce of choice—This amount of brine will cover one small onion, one large cucumber, or two ear’s worth of corn kernels. 3/4 cup white vinegar 1/2 cup beer (Pick your poison! I used an IPA this time but lagers and stouts are also tasty.) 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon salt 2 cloves of smashed garlic 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 1 bay leaf Cut your onions into slivers, slice your cucumbers, or remove your corn kernels from the cob. Place the prepared produce in a pint-sized mason jar or a soup container, and set it aside. If you want your pickles to have a kick, halve a jalapeño and throw that in there too. Add the remaining ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, pour the hot brine over the vegetables, cover them loosely, and let the liquid cool to room temperature. Pop your pickles in the fridge to cool overnight, then put them on sandwiches, sausages, and leftover pizza (for a very collegiate experience).","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties.

Kirsten Korosec,"Mercedes-Benz has often reserved its best tech for its highest class models the S Class being the first vehicle to get the latest and greatest. Now Mercedes is bringing more of tech, namely its new MBUX infotainment system, to other vehicles in its portfolio.
Enter the new CLA Class. Mercedes-Benz unveiled Monday the new CLA at CES 2019 a slightly bigger, sleeker, sportier and techier car than its predecessor in a direct appeal to a younger American customer.
The exterior of the new CLA hasn’t changed too much. The rear license plate has been moved down, and it has a bit more aerodynamic and sportier look with a long stretched bonnet featuring powerdomes. It’s sportier and sharper looking.
The more exciting stuff is what’s inside the vehicle. Inside the CLA Class, Mercedes has put its new MBUX system, which debuted in the new A Class. The GLE-Class SUV also has the new MBUX system.
This system is a major upgrade from its old COMAND interface. It’s loaded with features such as augmented reality for navigation, the ability to understand indirect voice commands and operational gestures from the users. The new Interior Assistant, as Mercedes calls, includes a robust gesture control system. 
In the dark, a reading lamp can be switched on and off by briefly extending a hand towards the rear-view mirror, for example. If the driver reaches over towards the unoccupied front passenger seat in the dark, it will be illuminated automatically, Mercedes said. The interior assistant includes a personal favorites function, which is accessed by holding a hand over the center console with the index and middle finger spread in a V-shape. A favorite command could be “navigate me home.” The driver and front passenger can even assign different favorites to the same hand position.
https://api.media.mercedes-benz.com/v2/storage/v1/public/30c11a98-d234-4a47-9e41-8c64350c1d48
And then there’s the voice assistant, which can handle complex questions. 
Ola Källenius, Daimler AG board member responsible for group research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, demonstrated the voice assistant at CES. “Drivers can speak even more naturally,” he said, adding that the days of yelling at your voice assistant in the car are over. “It’s the ultimate wearable.”
The driver or passenger just needs to say Hey Mercedes,” to engage the voice assistant. From there, they could ask for something as complicated as asking “Find child-friendly Asian restaurants nearby with 4-star rating which are neither Chinese nor Japanese,” an example Källenius gave during the demo.
Finally, there’s the “Energizing Coach.” This service is based on an intelligent algorithm. If a user is wearing the new Mercedes-Benz vivoactive 3 Smartwatch, which had its world première at CES, or another compatible Garmin wearable is worn, personal stats will be provided such as stress level or quality of sleep. The user’s pulse rate supplied by the integrated Garmin wearable is also shown on the media display.
The CLA is an important vehicle for Mercedes in the U.S. market. Mercedes first launched the compact four-door coupe in 2013 as its smallest and least-expensive vehicle in its portfolio that customers could buy in the United States.
It was the first compact Mercedes-Benz on the American market. And while it wasn’t viewed as the best vehicle by some critics, it proved to be popular with U.S. customers.
With the first CLA we celebrated a huge success by selling some 750,000 vehicles and created a totally new segment with a four-door coupé, adds Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing &amp; Sales.
The automaker has recognized the need to give this vehicle a boost of tech, especially considering that on average CLA customers in the U.S. are around 10 years younger than the typical Mercedes-Benz customer.
And it has. As Mercedes puts it, all elements of the interior are arranged according to the “overarching design themes of high tech and youthful avant-garde.'”
Translated this means designers ditched the cowl above the driver cockpit, giving the dashboard a grander look that continues uninterrupted. A widescreen display is completely free-standing. the youngs like screens.
The lower section is visually separated from the main body of the instrument cluster by a trench, and it appears to float in front of the instrument cluster. The ambient lighting enhances this effect. The air vents in a sporty turbine-look are another highlight.
The new CLA will be manufactured at the Kecskemét plant in Hungary and comes onto the market in May 2019.","Mercedes-Benz has often reserved its best tech for its highest class models — the S Class being the first vehicle to get the latest and greatest.

Kevin Billings,"Sure, flying to different places allows you to immerse yourself in an assortment of cultures, but here's the kicker: the actual act of traveling —you know, spending hours on planes, trains, and buses — is an experience that is painfully uncomfortable, and generally unpleasant.

PAMELA DRUCKERMAN,"Policymakers say teachers need more training in how to turn these tense encounters into “teachable moments” in which students can express their beliefs and teachers can help the class to discuss and deconstruct them. But French teachers don’t always encourage open discussion. Instead, they tend to lecture students on tolerance and values, which experts say has little effect. And until now, combating anti-Semitism in France has centered on the Holocaust. Students regularly tour Auschwitz and visit memorials. Sarah Gensburger, a sociologist who curated a 2012 exhibition at Paris’s city hall on the thousands of Jewish children who were deported from this city and murdered between 1942 and 1944, said most visiting class groups came from two heavily immigrant districts in northern Paris. She said the students emerged profoundly shaken. But that’s not enough, Dr. Gensburger said. “We’ve been developing more and more programs, places, meant to transmit the memory of the Holocaust as a way to build citizenship and tolerance,” she said, yet the government still counts hundreds of anti-Semitic incidents each year, and many more probably go unreported. “You can bring people to Auschwitz or wherever you want, but it will not change the everyday social networks and dynamics they live in,” she said. These dynamics can be murderous. In 2012, a 23-year-old Frenchman born to working-class Algerian immigrants walked up to a Jewish school in Toulouse and killed three children, ages 3, 6 and 8, and the father of two of them. Last year, one of the killer’s brothers published a book describing the anti-Semitic climate he grew up with: “In my family, we blamed the Jew, we blamed them for everything,” he wrote. Relatives would regularly say, “The Jews stole Algeria, the Jews control the world.” Obviously, all French Muslims don’t share these views. But in the recent attacks, ambient stereotypes seemed to transform neighborhood thugs and delinquents into anti-Semitic killers. To fight prejudice, some teachers say they’ve had to supplement France’s national curriculum. Samia Essabaa, who teaches high school English in a heavily immigrant area northeast of Paris, says it’s essential to valorize the places where students’ own families are from. On school trips to places including Morocco, she emphasizes the shared history of Jews and Muslims, like the fact that both religions ban pork, that both Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left, and that North African Jews eat couscous too. She said that once her students know that Jews “participated and contributed to the development of their country of origin, then we can tackle a lot of things, because it’s no longer a history of the other. No, it’s also my history.”",A poster reading “I am a Jew” during a demonstration in Paris last month after the killing of an 85-year-old Jewish woman.,2018-04-10T05:07:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Contributing Op-Ed Writer: What Are the French Doing to Protect Jews?

Alex Cranz,"If the last week has led you to be wary of having an Intel CPU powering your PC then you might want to get excited, because it seems like AMD might have started actually making CPUs you’d want instead of having Intel inside. It started last year with the announcement of Ryzen desktop CPUs. We found them to be cheaper and faster than comparably priced CPUs from Intel. Then late in the fall AMD announced a new line of mobile-based APUs —which is what they call their CPUs with integrated graphics. The new Ryzen APUs used the same Vega architecture found in AMD’s exceptional and affordable desktop GPUs. AMD then got a lot more appealing over the last week, when a security vulnerability was found in a wide range of computer processors (including AMD’s). Intel is grossly affected by the vulnerability and has already been hit with a number of class action complaints regarding the vulnerability and the necessary hampering of CPUs in order to resolve it, but AMD has repeatedly claimed that it is significantly less affected. It is, according to AMD and computer luminaries like Linux creator Linus Torvald, simply more secure. And now there are more AMD CPUs to choose from than in years. Today AMD announced three new 15 Watt APUs for pro customers: The Ryzen 7 Pro 2700U, Ryzen 5 Pro 2500U, and Ryzen 3 Pro 2300U. 15W processors are the ones found in ultralight laptops, like your Dell XPS 13, Lenovo 720, your Asus Zenbook 3—though the Pro processors are likely to be found in more enterprise-like laptops like the Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad line ups. For people who don’t want the additional security features of the Pro line there are still the regular 15W Ryzen APUs, and besides the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 in that class AMD announced two Ryzen 3 APUs today: The Ryzen 3 2300U and Ryzen 3 2200U. The Ryzen 3 APUs are positioned to compete with Intel’s 15W i3 processors. Which means they’re likely to be found in the cheaper laptops made by manufacturers, and once upon a time that would have been a very expected and not very good thing for AMD. Traditionally, the company has sold cheaper CPUs that use more energy, so you’d find them in huge, cheap eyesore laptops built by OEMs (those are the computer makers). Mindful of that fact, AMD has designed its new Ryzen APUs so that their performance is, at least, partially tied to the design of the laptop. It’s due to an automated overclocking feature called Mobile Extended Frequency Ranger (XFR). The better the thermal design of the laptop, the faster and more energy efficient the processor. But AMD doesn’t just want to be in the cheap laptops that were once it’s bread and butter. It strongly feels its latest processors are more than capable of competing with Intel, and now it has to convince not just consumers, but computers makers as well. “The excuse the OEMs would always give is ‘but you’re not competing with an i7 or an i5 in terms of performance’,” Jim Anderson, Senior Vice President and General Manger of the Computing and Graphics Business Group at AMD, told Gizmodo. He was explaining why AMD APUs never appeared in the laptops of the same class and quality as those found with Intel inside. “But,” Anderson continued “we certainly are now.” Bragging about AMD’s line up of APUs, which have only just begun to roll out in laptops available to consumers and the press, Anderson said “As more and more Ryzen systems come to market you will see the best range of premium notebooks that you’ve ever seen from AMD.” In our conversation, Anderson seemed positively giddy over AMD’s plans for the coming year. Besides the Ryzen Pro line and two Ryzen 3 APUs, there’s also the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 APU currently available, and today AMD also announced two desktop APUs available February 12: The $170 Ryzen 5 2400G and the $100 Ryzen 3 2200G. These processors, according to AMD, are faster (and way cheaper) than the comparable desktop processors from Intel: the $200 Intel i5-8500 and the $130 Intel i3-8100 respectively. In fact the Ryzen 5 2400G, according to AMD, is so fast it can handle top tier games like Battlefield 1 and Witcher 3, at playable frame rates, without a video card. That’s simply not possible with the current generation of Intel CPUs. The graphics aren’t insane—AMD compares the Ryzen 5 2400G’s GPU performance to the $75 Nvidia 1030—but the graphics, at that price, certainly seems crazy good if AMD’s benchmarks are to be believed. And it’s difficult not to be delighted at AMD also continuing to use the nearly 18-month old AM4 socket for these processors to connect to the motherboard. That’s the same socket used with chips from AMD’s last microarchitecture, Excavator, as well as all currently available Ryzen processors, and the many Ryzen processors expected over the next handful of years. According to Anderson, AMD is devoted to the AM4 socket and doesn’t want to force people to upgrade their motherboard every few years, as is currently necessary with Intel’s processors. “We’re going to stick with AM4 for a long time,” he told Gizmodo. And that means that the second generation of Ryzen CPUs, which Anderson also mentioned today, will work with the AM4 socket as well. These processors, which are expected in the second quarter of 2018, are part of AMD’s super aggressive attempt to chip away at Intel’s hold on the CPU market. AMD didn’t go into too much detail, but did say the 2nd-Gen Ryzen processors would operate on a new Zen+ microarchitecture and that it would shrink from the 14nm that Zen is on, to 12nm. That’s a 2nm difference in just one year! Intel, for comparison, introduced its first 14nm processor in 2014, and it has repeatedly delayed moving to something smaller. Moreover, AMD has even claimed it will have a 7nm processor, the Zen 2, ready for market in 2020. That’s a crazy rapid pace of development for a company that’s spent the better part of the last five years completely stagnant. And it’s crazy exciting for consumers, because, as Jim Anderson repeatedly noted in his conversation with Gizmodo, AMD is finally able to compete with Intel. It’s not the slow and cheap alternative. It’s, potentially, the faster and cheaper alternative. Which means, if Intel, who is already hurting from this security snafu, doesn’t want to find itself playing second fiddle, it will need to step up its game, because if the performance of these new Ryzen processors are as good as AMD claims than I know I’ll be seriously considering a switch.

Separately, he noted that transit facilities built before the federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the 1990s “are generally not required to be made accessible.” Joe Rappaport, the executive director of the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, an organization bringing one of the suits, said the transit agency needed to be required to live up to Mr. Byford’s promises. “Andy Byford’s successor or the successor after that may not have the same commitment,” he said. For now, the challenges persist. April Coughlin, a transit advocate and college professor who uses a wheelchair, anticipated problems on a recent afternoon when she took the R train to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. Since early morning, the app on her cellphone had said the elevator at DeKalb Avenue was not working. It wasn’t when she arrived around 3:15 p.m. The sign promised it would be fixed by 5 p.m. (someone had crossed out 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.). But Ms. Coughlin was due at Long Island University to teach a class that began at 4:30 p.m. “How do I get to work?” she asked on the platform, deep underground with no way to get to the street. “The building is literally outside.”","Gabriela Amari, using a subway elevator, must take a circuitous route to work because the station she lives near is not accessible.

Darrell Etherington,"Tesla has unveiled its all-electric semi truck, aptly dubbed the ‘Tesla Semi,’ as promised, and the resulting Class 8 transport vehicle is indeed a sight to behold. It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road. The Tesla Semi will go 0 to 60 mph in just 5 seconds, which is incredibly fast compared to a diesel truck. It can go 0 to 60 mph towing 80,000 lbs, its max tow load, in just 20 seconds. It can go 65 mph up a 5 percent grade, which is way better than the 45 mph max that a diesel competitor can do. And for range, it can go 500 miles at highway speed, and less than 80 percent trips are at 250 miles. It also has a better drag coefficient than a super car thanks to its extremely aerodynamic design. The real secret weapon of the truck, however, isn’t that it can turn into a giant fighting robot (this feature hasn’t been activated yet, if it does exist, and Tesla won’t admit that it does). Instead, it’s that the truck offers a transmission that requires no shifting of gears (as is normal for fully electric vehicles) with regenerative braking that provides “basically infinite” brake life per Tesla. Tesla also says that the Semi outperforms its diesel rivals in terms of responsiveness and handling, and can cover more miles than a diesel semi truck in the same timespan, with safer operation in and around regular traffic. It also uses a number of Model 3 components to maximize production efficiencies, including individual Model 3 motors for each wheel, and even Model 3 inset door handles. Another standout for Tesla’s Semi lies in its design – the company points out that that cabin is tailor-made for drivers, with starts that are designed to make it easier to get in and out, and the ability to stand fully when inside the cab. The driver is also centered in the cab relative to the road, a unique twist on vehicle design in general, but a logical one for a car class that almost never has a passenger. There’s a removable jump seat for a passenger, too, offset and behind the main driver position. Tesla has also added not one, but two of its favorite in-cabin vehicle features to the Semi: Touchscreens. These are positioned on either side of the driver and offer navigation information, blind spot monitoring, and trip data logging applications. There’s also a suite of fleet management and routing tools, which Tesla says would ordinarily require third-party add-on hardware to incorporate into a car. Electric trucks aren’t the exclusive purview of Musk and Tesla, of course. There’s the somewhat trollishly named Nikola, which is working on a hybrid hydrogen powered electric powertrain, which its building with Bosch. Also, Daimler has revealed its own concept for a Mitsubishi E-FUSO fully electric Vision One truck with 220 miles of range, but with no specified release window. What’s the big deal about an electric semi truck? It’s a fair question, especially given the range of traditional Diesel engine heavy duty trucks. These can have ranges of up to nearly 900 miles on a single tank. But the long-term advantages of electric trucks could make a lot of sense, both from a relatively obvious ecological perspective, which is obvious, and from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. Electric trucks could be longer-lived and less expensive to maintain over the long term, and the cost to refuel them over their lifetimes should be far less than the cost to operate a truck that uses an internal combustion engine. Tesla says the Semi requires “significantly less maintenance” than a diesel truck, in particular because it lacks the high-strain moving parts of internal combustion engine vehicles, including the engine, transmission, after-treatment system and differentials. The Tesla Semi also offers advanced safety features, with a special battery design that reinforces the battery units themselves and also helps lower the center of gravity of the truck overall thanks to their positioning in the chassis. The windshield is also built of glass designed to resist impacts, and the truck is made to avoid jackknifing, a common problem for this class of truck, by automatically detecting any stability that could lead to this issue and torquing each wheel accordingly, whose also activating the brakes as needed. Surround view cameras try to eliminate blind sots, and also help to support object detection, providing alerts to the driver automatically when they identify potential hazards. Tesla has also built Enhanced Autopilot features into its Semi, which is not surprising given the work it’s done pioneering and refining these drier assistance features on its lineup of consumer cars. On the Semi, Tesla’s Autopilot offers automated emergency braking, lane keeping and lane departure warnings to help encourage safe highway driving. This is definitely a futuristic version of the modern transport truck, with a lot of bells and whistles that indeed look like they could make the lives of both freight shipping companies and drivers much more comfortable and convenient overall. The focus on drivers, in particular, is interesting as it appears as though Tesla is hoping to gain support for its trucking from ground-up endorsement, as well as by appealing to the long-term financial reasoning of the shipping companies themselves. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA This version of the truck is a day truck, without a sleeper and designed for short hauls accordingly. But Tesla said it could easily extend the cab to accommodate a sleeper cabin, and then extend the underlying battery pack to support that, too. It can also be used with or without the aerodynamic cowling above the hood, depending on the height of the trailer it’s pulling. Tesla will probably still face a lot of challenges in terms of both getting this truck built at scale, and encouraging broad adoption. But it’s sticking to its playbook of looking at an industry where the legacy players have done something one way for a long time with relatively little in the way of innovation, and changing things drastically. The question is whether applying this model will continue to work in its favor.","It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Turns out Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt may not have needed to travel in luxury to escape threats, according to, uh, the EPA. This is awkward! Two Senate Democrats released a letter on Tuesday contradicting the EPA administrator’s claim that he needed round-the-clock security and first class seats because he had received death threats, and demanding a bipartisan oversight inquiry by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In February, Pruitt said that his first class flights were a decision made “by the (security) detail, the security assessment in addition to the chief of staff.” But in the letter published by the Washington Post, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) and Tom Carper (D-Delaware) said they had a memo dated February 14 disputing that account, from the EPA’s intelligence team. The memo reportedly looked at the evidence compiled by Pruitt’s security team that gave him the green light to fly first class and have a security detail that cost $3 million in public funds. It concluded those decisions were misguided at best, and wrong and wasteful at worst. Here’s a snippet (emphasis original): “(The memo) DOES NOT employ sound analysis or articulate relevant ‘threat specific’ information appropriate to draw any resource or level of threat conclusions regarding the protection posture for the Administrator...[u]sing all source intelligence resources, EPA Intelligence has not identified any specific credible direct threat to the EPA Administrator.” Among the threats used to justify Pruitt’s life of luxury were a social media post where someone said he was “not happy with some of the Administrator’s policies and wanted to express his displeasure,” which, welcome to the internet, buddy. Other threats include someone who wanted to dump their old paint at the Administrator’s office, a letter from someone in jail, and a postcard that stated the fact that “CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL!” It’s unclear if there were any actual death threats, but several Freedom of Information Act requests for death threats have yet to turn up any. E&amp;E News reports there have been an uptick in threats against Pruitt, and the new letter puts the total at 16 for the last fiscal year. All this sure makes it sound like Pruitt didn’t need a personal army to watch him 24/7. Of course, this is just the latest in a stream of scandals that have turned Pruitt into a political Superfund site. Democrats and Republicans have called on him to resign or be fired, the executive branch’s ethic watchdog sent a rare letter to the EPA questioning Pruitt’s actions, and even Fox News owned him during a disastrous interview. In any other administration, Pruitt would be on his way out. But because the optics of what he’s doing — even if the not results —appeal to Trump’s base, he’s managed to hang on for now.","Turns out Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt may not have needed to travel in luxury to escape threats, according to, uh, the EPA.

The final assessment is based on a personal self-improvement project. “In reality, a lot of us are anxious, stressed, unhappy, numb,” said Alannah Maynez, a freshman. “The fact that a class like this has such large interest speaks to how tired students are of numbing their emotions — both positive and negative — so they can focus on their work, the next step, the next accomplishment.” Read more » Photo The Island Aquatics Synchro Club strikes a pose.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","Dont forget! is one of those things I say to my daughter with gusto in my voice but fear in my soul.
 Dont forget to pack your music folder in your backpack for singing class this afternoon. 
Dont forget to put your laundry away. 
Dont forget to return your library books. 
Yeah, shes totally going to forget, I tell myself as she walks out of my sight. 
Im learning that dont forget is a waste-of-time command. As time management expert Leslie Josel explained on the Mighty Parenting podcast, Your brain is a muscle like every other muscle in your body. And just like every other muscle, it needs to be exercised. If you the parent are the one calling the shotsgo here at this time, go there at this time, dont forget your water bottle, dont forget your soccer bagthe only brain that is being exercised is yours.
Instead, you want to help your kids form their own connections. For younger kids, a simple question to ask is: How are you going to remember that?
Its a question that makes them pause, and then start coming up with solutionsa skill they will need to use all day, every day, for the rest of their lives. When you ask How are you going to remember that you need to meet me in front of school at 2:30 instead of 3 p.m. today? they might say they will write a note for themselves and put it in their folder. When you ask How are you going to remember to bring home the jacket you left at your friends house last time? perhaps theyll say they can put it in their bag as soon as they get there. 
With older kids and teens, Josel says she likes to ask, Whats your plan? Its softer, and sounds more like curiosity than nagging. She gives the example, Whats your plan to get that paper written because were going to grandmas for the weekend? 
What youre doing is youre helping them see time, she explains. Youre helping them see future time. All of a sudden, their brain is forced to actually think ahead. 
Maybe their plan will work, or maybe it wont. Your kids will probably forget things sometimes, face the consequences, and then hopefully come up with a better plan next time. What the shift in language does is detach you, the parent, from their daily triumphs and fails. Its now on them.

David Murphy,"It’s a big day today for World of Warcraft, the massive multiplayer online game from Blizzard Entertainment. The game’s seventh expansion officially kicks off at 3 pm (PT) for North American players, ensuring many a geek will be skipping dinner tonight—or ordering in—as they devour as much content as they can get before bedtime. If you’ve seen or heard people getting excited for World of Warcraft because it’s “getting back to its roots,” thanks to a renewed focus on the shared hatred between the game’s two major factions—Horde and Alliance—in its new Battle for Azeroth expansion, maybe you’re tempted to sign up and give the game a whirl. Or, if you haven’t played in years, perhaps you’re curious to see what’s changed. Spoiler: A lot has changed. It can feel daunting to jump into a huge world of which you know very little, and World of Warcraft is gigantic. You will feel overwhelmed if you just rush in. As a returning player who used to write for the freakin’ World of Warcraft magazine (RIP), even I find it hard to figure out exactly where to get started adventuring if I haven’t played the game for a while. No matter your experience level—whether you’re about to experience the thrill of hearing the Stormwind City theme as you walk through its epic gates for the first time, or whether you can spell Ahn’Qiraj off the top of your head—here are some tips and suggestions for making the most of your new life in the World of Warcraft ( or your epic, Illidan-like return to Azeroth.) Watching your way through World of Warcraft Let’s start with the basics. At its core, World of Warcraft is a grand, spiraling saga centered on two warring factions: the aforementioned Horde and Alliance. They’ve been fighting each other since the days of MS-DOS, locked a never-ending war—save for those rare moments where they attempt to team up to counter a greater threat—that has taken them across continents, into space, and through time. If that all sounds confusing, that’s perfectly understandable. Thankfully, there are some fantastic videos you can watch to catch yourself up to speed on the 14-year journey that is World of Warcraft. Grab your lunch, take out your phone, plug in your headphones (important), and let Blizzard’s experts help you through the game’s considerable lore: If you need the abridged version, because you’d rather spend an hour in a game than hearing someone talk about a game, you can also check out the excellent “New &amp; Returning Player Guides” series from YouTuber (and World of Warcraft expert) Bellular. And you probably even skip the bits about ”how to purchase” or “how to install” the game, saving you even more time for new World of Warcraft adventures: You can also kick up your feet and watch your way through World of Warcraft’s story via Blizzard’s incredible cinematics—one of the company’s cornerstones. Sure, you’ll be spoiling yourself for parts of the game you have yet to uncover, and you might not know the importance of the various characters you’re watching, but you’ll at least get a pretty good sense of how World of Warcraft operates. Also, did we mention that Blizzard’s cinematics are gorgeous? We’d rather watch these than the Warcraft movie, that’s for sure. World of Warcraft resources worth reading for new players If you’d rather read than watch, there are also plenty of resources you can use to acclimate yourself to World of Warcraft, figure out what to do next, and ask questions when you’re feeling stuck. For the basics, I recommend reviewing Wowhead’s “ Guide on How to Play World of Warcraft,” which is definitely worth scanning if you’re new to massively multiplayer online games or just want to get a sense of how Blizzard’s approach differs from others you’ve played. Blizzard also has a handy New Player’s Guide, split into four major sections, as well as its “ A Return to World of Warcraft ” compendium. And be sure to check out Blizzard’s online forums, especially the New Player Help and Guides forum, where you’ll be able to find more information, ask questions, and engage with some of the World of Warcraft community’s most helpful members. It’s been nearly 14 years since Blizzard launched the world’s most popular massively multiplayer… Read more Read Take advantage of World of Warcraft’s Starter Edition and Class Trials As Kotaku’s own Mike Fahey notes in his own epic new player guide, one of the most important tips new (or returning) World of Warcraft players should know is that you don’t actually have to buy the game. That’s right. You don’t have to spend a single penny to play World of Warcraft. Download the game right now, create an account (a new one; not your old one, if you were a previous player), and you’ll be able to level your character all the way to 20 for free. There are other annoying limitations placed on this free experience, but it’s still a great way to familiarize yourself with the world, see if you enjoy the experience as much as you were hoping, and get a feel for the different classes before you settle on a main one to play as for the next 100 levels’ worth of gaming. If you’re a returning player, consider paying for a month’s worth of playing time—a mere $15—and using the game’s newer Class Trials to see if you still have that spark for higher-level play. While you can also go the “ Starter Edition ” route for a free, limited romp through Azeroth, you might need a little more than the newbie zones to help you decide whether you want to play through the game’s latest expansion. Find friends to adventure with Even though you will invariably do a bit of soloing during your time in World of Warcraft, the game is a lot more fun when you have other people to interact with. Whether you’re starting out, or getting back into the swing of things, having helpful mentors feeding you suggestions (or gear, or gold) doesn’t hurt, either. The /r/wownoob subreddit is a good place to find friends to quest with, as is the main World of Warcraft subreddit (and don’t forget its helpful “ Murloc Monday ” thread for newbie Q&amp;A). You can try joining a Discord server themed around the class you’re playing, how you like to play World of Warcraft (achievement hunting, dungeon-running, player-versus-player combat, etc.), or your location, to name a few examples. World of Warcraft also has player communities built directly into the game. Find a community themed for newbies, or whatever else you want, and you’ll have a great resource to go to with questions. You might even make a few friends (or fellow adventurers). Getting ready for Battle of Azeroth: the nitty-gritty We’ve spent a lot of time focusing on those with less experience in the nuances of World of Warcraft. If you’re a player who generally knows how to get around the game—or did at one point—you’re probably still going to feel a little stuck if it’s been a decent amount of time since you last played. For example, why does your favorite weapon no longer work the way it used to? What’s the latest currency you have to know about? Should you ever waste time hanging out in your Garrison again? If you’re jumping back in for Battle for Azeroth, we recommend checking out the big “what to do first” guide from Wowhead. You’re also going to want to brush up on specific advice for your class—both Icy Veins and Wowhead have incredibly detailed guides for all of the game’s combinations of classes and specializations. Make sure you go in and figure out all the new (or changed) talents you’ll be using, and start to memorize a typical combat rotation so you don’t die nearly as much in game’s latest incarnation. There are also a number of different online tools you can use to make yourself a better World of Warcraft player—and to help you decide what to focus on. Wowhead has a great Attunement Tool that shows you how close you are to unlocking significant milestones in the game, like unlocking new allied races, earning reputations with key factions (which will ultimately help you unlock faster mount speed and other goodies in the game’s expansion), and how far along you are in your dungeons and raids. If you just care about unlocking the ability to fly in the new expansion, the site’s Pathfinder tool is a must-bookmark. Its Character Planner is also incredibly useful for getting a sense of what you could (or should) do next, based on your recent activity, the gear you’re wearing (and would like to upgrade), achivements you’re close to unlocking, et cetera. If you want a simpler guide, the site also has a great list of all the activities you should be doing each day and week in Battle for Azeroth. We’re also big fans of Simple Armory, which gives you a similar look at your overall progression in the entire game, as well as a gorgeous, detailed graphical listing of all the achievements you’ve unlocked, as well as the mounts, companions, pets, and toys you’ve collected. The site makes it incredibly easy to see what you still have to get, if you’re a completionist. If you’re looking to fill out your collection of mounts, the site will even create a handy, optimized guide of how you should spend your day (or week) adventuring to acquire them all. A number of World of Warcraft fans have also made their own handy guides that you can follow when starting out in the game’s latest expansion—a perfect reason to run a dual-monitor setup, right? And, of course, there are plenty of in-game addons you can use to make your adventures in Azeroth even more efficient. Try checking out Azeroth Auto Pilot, which points you where to go, handles all your NPC discussions and quest turn-ins, and automatically sells your junk gear (among other features). Deadly Boss Mods is still a must-have, so you don’t die in dungeons quite so quickly. Pawn helps you tell whether the gear you’re getting is actually an upgrade or not.

Lucas Matney,"As social media sites grow more massive and all-encompassing, one startup is looking to bring back the friendly customization of Myspace to a new generation of users looking to define their online presence in a unique way. Universe is a mobile-based website builder for the social media era, eschewing complicated templates for easily customizable website “filters” that pin trendy designs to a grid pattern where users can drag and drop photos, videos, icons to build up a mobile-optimized website in minutes on the company’s iOS app. “People use Universe because they want to build a website on their phone and they want full control over how that site looks,” founder Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch. “In many ways are trying to pick up the baton from Tumblr.” The team launched with $3.2 million in funding last year from Box Group, General Catalyst, Greylock Partners and Eniac Ventures. We profiled the startup then, now they’re about to emerge from Y Combinator’s latest startup class with some new funding and an increasing feature set for users. When the service first launched it was a single-page home for quick information and links that you could build in just a minute or two. The site has maintained the quick onboarding site creation, but last month, the mobile-focused app began tackling multi-page sites that could stack pages together with a simple CMS that users could blog directly onto their sites with. “If you look at us like a website builder, our product DNA is more like Lego,” Cohen said. The added functionality gives users significantly more to go off of and deepens the utility for artists using the site to show off their portfolio. The company has long maintained that they want to help you create the website that you link to in your Instagram bio, that’s a pretty tight goal, but they startup has steadily added features that make this a pretty convincing sell. The added utility is causing a boom in traffic to the startup’s network of sites with traffic increasing 10 percent week-over-week, while the network of sites built on Universe grows by thousands each week as well. The app was also recently featured as the App of the Day on the App Store. In terms of pricing, the service is free for users who are fine having their site on the Universe domain (ex. lucasmatney.onuniverse.com), and $3 per month for those that would like their own URL. Additionally, users can pony up an additional $3 to add analytics or strip away the Universe logo from the bottom of the site. You can download Universe for free on iOS.","As social media sites grow more massive and all-encompassing, one startup is looking to bring back the friendly customization of Myspace to a new generation of users looking to define their online presence in a unique way.

Beth Skwarecki,"Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain. But AIs aren’t all run by mega-corporations and governments; you can download some algorithms and play with them yourself, with often hilarious results. There’s the faux Coachella poster full of fake band names, created by feeding a bunch of real band names into a neural network and asking it to come up with some of its own. There are the recipes created in a similar way, where “barbecue beef” calls for “1 beer - cut into cubes.” And then there’s my favorite, Janelle Shane’s AI-generated paint colors (tag yourself, I’m Dorkwood). Humans aren’t nearly as creative as we think. Craft brewers, for example, have run out of fun names … Read more Read These were all made with neural networks, a type of AI modeled on the network-like nature of our own brains. You train a neural network by giving it input: recipes, for example. The network strengthens some of the connections between its neurons (imitation brain cells) more than others as it learns. The idea is that it’s figuring out the rules of how the input works: which letters tend to follow others, for example. Once the network is trained, you can ask it to generate its own output, or to give it a partial input and ask it to fill in the rest. But the computer doesn’t actually understand the rules of, say, making recipes. It knows that beer can be an ingredient, and that things can be cut into cubes, but nobody has ever told it that beer is not one of those things. The outputs that look almost right, but misunderstand some fundamental rule, are often the most hilarious. I was happy to just watch these antics from afar, until Shane mentioned on Twitter that a middle school coding class had generated better ice cream names than she had. And I thought, if kids can do this, I can do this. How to Train Your First Neural Net I started with the same toolkit Shane used for ice cream flavors: a python module called textgenrnn, by Max Woolf of Buzzfeed. You’ll need a basic knowledge of the command line to work with it, but it works on any system (Mac, Linux, Windows) where you’ve installed the programming language/interpreter python. Before you can train your own neural net, you’ll need some input to start with. The middle school class started with a list of thousands of ice cream flavors, for example. Whatever you choose, you’ll want at least a few hundred examples; thousands would be better. Maybe you’d like to download all your tweets, and ask the network to generate you some new tweets. Or check out Wikipedia’s list of lists of lists for ideas. Whatever you choose, get it into a text file with one item per line. This may take some creative copy-and-paste or spreadsheet work, or if you’re an old hand at coding, you can write some ugly perl scripts to munge the data into submission. I’m an ugly perl script kind of girl, but when I ended up wanting Lifehacker headlines for one of my data sets, I just asked our analytics team for a big list of headlines and they emailed me exactly what I needed. Asking nicely is an underrated coding skill. (If you’d like to feed Lifehacker headlines into your own neural net, here is that list. It’s about 10,000 of them.) Create a folder for your new project, and write two scripts. First, one called train.py: from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn() t.train_from_file(‘input.txt’, num_epochs=5); This script will get the neural net reading your input and thinking about what its rules must be. The script has a couple things you can modify: t = textgenrnn() is fine the first time you run the script, but if you’d like to come back to it later, enter the name of the.hdf5 file that magically appeared in the folder when you ran it. In that case, the line should look like this: t=textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5’) ‘input.txt’ is the name of your file with one headline/recipe/tweet/etc per line. num_epochs is how many times you’d like to process the file. The neural network gets better the longer you let it study, so start with 2 or 5 to see how long that takes, and then go up from there. It takes a while to train the network. If you’re running your scripts on a laptop, one epoch might take 10 or 15 minutes (bigger data sets will take longer). If you have access to a beefy desktop, maybe your or a friend’s gaming computer, things will go faster. If you’ve got a big data set, you may want to ask it for a few dozen or even hundreds of epochs, and let it run overnight. Next, write another script called spit_out_stuff.py (you’re free to give these better names than I did): from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5') t.generate(20, temperature=0.5) This is the fun part! The script above will give you 20 fun new things to look at. The important parts of that last line are: The number of things to generate: here, 20. The temperature, which is like a creativity dial. At 0.1, you’ll get very basic output that’s probably even more boring than what you fed in. At 1.0, the output will get so creative that often what comes out isn’t even real words. You can go higher than 1.0, if you dare. When you ran the training script, you’ll have noticed that it shows you sample output at different temperatures, so you can use that to guide how many epochs you run, and what temperature you’d like to use to generate your final output. Not every idea your neural network comes up with will be comedy gold. You’ll have to pick out the best ones yourself. Here are some of the better Lifehacker headlines that my AI came up with: The Best Way to Make a Baby Laptop How to Survive a Backspace Drinking Game The Best Way to Buy a Job Interview How to Get the Best Bonfire of Your Life With This Handy Graphic How to Make Your Own Podcast Bar How to Get a New iPhone X If You’re an Arduino How to Clean Up Your Own Measurements in a Museum How to Get Started With Your Stories and Anxiety The Best Way to Make Your Own Ink Out of the Winter How to Keep Your Relationship With an Imaginary Concept The Best Way to Make a Perfect Cup of Wine With a Raspberry Pi The Best Way to Eat a Toilet Strawberry How to Get a Better Job on Your Vacation The Best Way to Eat a Stubborn Jar I got these by playing with the temperature and the number of training epochs, and every time I saw something I liked I copied it into a text file of my favorites. I also experimented with the word-by-word version of the algorithm; the scripts above use the default character-by-character model. My final list of headlines includes results from both. If you’re curious about some of the rejects, here’s what I get with a 0.1 temperature: The Best Way to Stay Streaming to Stop More Alternative to Make Your Phone The Best Way to Stream the Best Power When You Don’t Need to Know About the World The Best Way to Stay Started to Stay Started to Your Common Ways to Stop Anyone How to Get the Best Way to See the Best Popular Posts The Best Way to Stay Started to Make Your Phone And if I crank it up to 1.5 (dangerously creative): Remains of the Day: How to Ad-Finger the Unsubual Renew Qakeuage to Travel History, Ovenchime, or “Contreiting Passfled The Risk-Idelecady’t Two-Copyns, Focusing Zoomitas Ifo Went Vape Texts Battery Oro crediblacy Supremee Buldsweoapotties DIY Grilling Can Now Edt My Hises Uniti to Spread Your Words Clearly, human help is needed. Become Your AI’s Buddy Even though neural nets can learn from data sets, they don’t truly understand what’s going on. That’s why some of the best results come from partnerships between people and machines. “I know it is a tool that I use,” says Janelle Shane, “but it is hard not to think of it as—‘come on little neural network, you can do it’ and ‘Oh, that was clever’ or ‘You’re getting confused, poor little thing.’ To make the most of your relationship, you’ll have to guide your AI buddy. Sometimes it might get so good at guessing the rules of your data set that it just recreates the same things you fed it—the AI version of plagiarism. You’ll have to check that its funny output is truly original. Botnik studios pairs people with machines by training predictive-text keyboards. Imagine if you picked up your friend’s phone, and typed messages by just using the predictive text on their keyboard. You’d end up writing your own message, but in a style that reads like your friend’s. In the same way, you can train a Botnik keyboard with any data source you’d like, and then write with the words supplied by the keyboard. That’s where this amazing advice column duel came from: two Botnik keyboards trained on Savage Love and Dear Abby. If you’d prefer to work against, rather than with, your algorithmic buddy, check out how Janelle Shane pranked a neural net that at first appeared to be good at recognizing sheep grazing in a meadow. She photoshopped out the sheep, and realized the AI was just looking for white blobs in grass. If she colored the sheep orange, the AI thought they were flowers. So she asked her Twitter followers for sheep in unusual places and found that the AI thinks a sheep in a car must be a dog, goats in a tree must be birds, and a sheep in a kitchen must be a cat. Serious AIs can have similar problems, and playing with algorithms for fun can help us understand why they’re so error-prone. For example, one early skin-cancer-detecting AI accidentally learned the wrong rules for telling the difference between cancerous and benign skin lesions. When a doctor finds a large lesion, they often photograph it next to a ruler to show the size. The AI accidentally taught itself that it’s easy to spot cancerous tumors: just look for rulers. Another lesson we can learn is that an algorithm’s output is only as good as the data you feed in. ProPublica found that one algorithm used in sentencing was harsher on black defendants than white ones. It didn’t consider race as a factor, but its input led it to believe, incorrectly, that the crimes and backgrounds common to black defendants were stronger predictors of repeat offenses than the crimes and backgrounds associated with white defendants. This computer had no idea of the concept of race, but if your input data reflects a bias, the computer can end up perpetuating that bias. It’s best that we understand this limitation of algorithms, and not assume that because they aren’t human they must be impartial. (Good luck with your hate speech AI, Facebook!) Mix Up Your Data Sets There’s no need to stop at one data set; you can mix up two of them and see what results. (I combined the product listings from the Goop and Infowars stores, for example. Slightly NSFW.) You can also train a classifying algorithm. Shane says she already had a list of metal bands and a list of My Little Pony names, so she trained a classifier to tell the difference. (Pinky Doom: 99 percent metal.) Once you have a classifier trained, you can feed anything into it and get a reading. Benedict Cumberbatch: 96 percent metal. You can also feed anything you like into a trained textgenrnn network. When you specify how many items you want and what temperature (creativity) the network should use, you can also give it a prefix. It will then try to come up with words that should follow that prefix. After I trained the Lifehacker headlines, I asked the AI to give me headlines beginning with “3 Ingredient Happy Hour.” It responded with some wonderful fictional cocktails (again, these are my picks out of a longer list): 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Herb Stressful Upgrade 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Cake’s Strawbreak 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Darkled Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Pizza and Beverage For They Are Trader Wings 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Ferrent Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Throat Into a Refreshing 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Bar Order 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Leftover Party Controci 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Summer Rum Cutting 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Coconati 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Beautiful Shicline 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Cheekey Candy Don’t be surprised if you see these in a future Lifehacker post; Claire Lower, our food and beverage editor, says she wants to attempt making some of these. But instead of waiting for her expert recipes, I decided to feed these into a neural network as well. I gathered some cocktail recipes from Chris Lowder’s cocktail guide and the WikiBooks cocktails glossary, and arranged them so that each cocktail took up one line of a text file, with the title of the cocktail as the first few words. That means I could choose a cocktail name and ask my cocktail-trained neural net to provide the recipe that follows. Here are a few of the results: The Best Coconati - oz. Benedictine e. 1 dash Aromatic b. &lt;1 oz. Cranberry d..5 oz. Lemon c..75 oz. Iteloun d. 2 dashes Juponged Slipes i. Stir/Strain/Coupe/No garnish The Cheekey Candy i. 1 oz. Blendey Sherry b. 1.5 oz.

Orange half whiskey You can ask it for anything, of course: The Beth Skwarecki - 1 oz. Blended Scotch (Juice) Water b. 1 oz. Egg White in large rocks glass with dets 1934 or makes Babbino﻿ The Lifehacker c. 14 Vodka Martini i..75 oz. Campari i. Shake/Fine strain/Coupe/Lemon twist The input data was only a few hundred cocktail recipes, so I had to turn the temperature way up to get anything interesting. And at a high temperature (1.0, in this case), sometimes you get words that aren’t really words. Good luck finding any Lonstine Brandy or Blendey Sherry in a store—but if you do, my pet AI will be very happy.","Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain.

ReadWrite Product Reviews,"The Segway was the first of the self-balancing class. Then came the hoverboards. Now it’s time for the future of self-balancing vehicles. Meet the SoloWheel Glide 3, a self-balancing electric unicycle that serves as a fun and convenient way to get around town. The team at ReadWrite got to “Glide” around in one of these for a while and we’re hear to tell you what we think of it. SoloWheel Glide 3 Specs The SoloWheel is a self balancing electric unicycle, or an EUC (not our term). The SoloWheel can zip around at a max speed of 19 miles per hour and travel up to 31 miles on a full charge. Although, our team doesn’t recommend taking this thing to it’s max speed right away. The range on the SoloWheel is also a big plus. As long as you leave the charger at your home or wherever you typically travel to, you should be just fine. The downside to all that power and range is weight. The SoloWheel weights a little over 30 lbs which isn’t the most fun to carry around with you. Not to mention, it’s not able to climb up stairs very well either. Fortunately, the SoloWheel Glide 3 does come with a retractable handle that you can use to walk the wheel around like a suitcase. This makes it much easier to walk around with while you aren’t riding. You can find all the other specs here. Must Be Hard to Ride Right? We’re going to be honest with you guys. There’s definitely a learning curve to riding the SoloWheel. At first, it’s difficult to maintain proper balance. The SoloWheel is very sensitive to your movements, so any lean forward or backwards will trigger movement. When you’re getting started for the first time, I highly recommend holding onto something sturdy. And try to make sure it’s not something that can be ripped off the wall… The best way to learn is to practice moving back and forth by leaning while standing in between a doorway. Hold onto both sides of the doorway while you lean back and forth. You need to train your body and mind to trust the device. Once you’ve practiced this, try taking it for a spin without holding on to anything. We recommend picking a wall or table 10-15ft away and ride over to it trying to maintain your balance the whole time. Once you’ve practiced enough in the office (we don’t recommend riding this in the office), you can take it out in the parking lot for longer rides. After about 3 days of riding, you should be able to take it around town. Again, it really comes down to trust and balance. Once you get the hang of those, you should be fine. Summary The SoloWheel Glide 3 isn’t a cheap gadget. It retails for $899 USD. That said, it’s a well-built machine and deserves that price tag. Whether you’re looking for a new toy or a fun way to commute to and from work, the Solo Wheel Glide 3 is definitely something you should consider. Just remember to wear your safety equipment while riding! Special thanks to wellbots for setting us up.","The Segway was the first of the self-balancing class. Then came the hoverboards.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","It’s come to this: Doctors are now being told to prescribe play. The American Academy of Pediatrics details the urgency of the matter in a policy statement. There is a play deficit in this country, and we know it, don’t we? In articles about parenting, it seems that there’s no breed dissected more than that of the bubble-wrapped child who’s shuttled from Mandarin to fencing to organic cheese making classes until bedtime. We love reminiscing about the days when we could hop on bikes and meander for hours with the neighborhood kids (few of whose names our parents ever took the time to learn), and yearn for our kids to have that experience. We’ve learned that play enhances brain structure, helps kids practice empathy and makes them more creative and innovative. And yet it’s strangely difficult to crack some of the structure of children’s lives. I know that I feel some pressure to add more adult instruction to my daughter’s days when I’m handed an inch-thick packet of extracurricular activities by her school teacher (“Ooh, robotics fight club”), or when other parents ask me what her schedule looks like for the fall (“Um, we’ve got Halloween?”), or when I read interviews by musicians and dancers and athletes who mention they started their paths to mastery at age three (“Argh, we’re already too late!”). To back off, it takes some real willpower and planning. Here are some tips for unscheduling your child in today’s overscheduled world. Be Realistic You don’t need to move to the woods so your kids can frolic in streams all day to give your family more healthy play time. There are benefits of having scheduled activities —higher self-esteem, lower rates of drug and alcohol use over time and social bonds. Some parents of middle schoolers told me that having their kids deeply involved in extracurriculars they love is what has kept them mostly safe during a time of peer pressure and emotional disarray. The goal here is simply to protect your kids’ downtime. Denise Pope, one of the authors of Overloaded and Underprepared: Strategies for Stronger Schools and Healthy, Successful Kids, tells the New York Times that young children need an hour of play time (which does not include dinner or homework or baths) for every after-school scheduled hour. You might set a rule for your kids such as one sport or activity per season. (I’ve decided to put my daughter in another voice class, which she absolutely loves.) You have to find the right balance for your family. Start With a Good Playtime Setting Dr. Robert Murray, the lead author of the AAP report The Crucial Role of Recess, tells me, “Parents can absolutely help their child find safe, interesting environments for them to explore—but it’s important to let him or her self-direct.” He suggests playgrounds, beaches and streams, woods and parks, fields, the zoo, local farms or indoor spaces where kids can pretend play with peers. Wherever you choose to go, step back and give them some “ BE Time,” which he describes as the antidote to parent-directed activities. At home, give kids access to open-ended materials to tinker with, even stuff you might see as junk. Blocks are always awesome, but so are random pieces of string, aluminum foil, masking tape, egg cartons, toilet paper rolls and emptied shampoo bottles. Prepare for the Suck Realize that it’s sometimes hard to give kids downtime. On weekends, the first thing my daughter asks when she wakes up is “Where are we going today?” When I tell her nowhere, she whines and declares that is so boring. And then parent-friends will start texting me: “What are you up to today? Wanna bring the kids to library story time? Or princess ballet class? Or go watch a movie?”And I often want to say “Yes!” It would be easy to strap my kid into the car and do any one of those things. But it’s good to sometimes say no. I know that my daughter’s groans will eventually turn to silence, and as I do my own thing around the house, I’ll often find her cheerfully playing with her dollhouse or making something out of a cardboard box or drawing with chalk in the backyard. Put white space on your calendar and prepare for some protests. Then find something to do and let your kids do the same. “We’re all together. This is supposed to be fun.” Read more Read Connect With Other Back-Off Parents Some parents are finding that as much as they want to unschedule their kids, there’s a problem: Their children have no one to play with. Playgrounds are barren as every other kid is off at chess or tae kwon do at 3:30 PM. A project called Let Grow is addressing that issue, connecting local parents who want to give their kids more independence by doing less for them. You can sign up to find nearby families. Once you find other likeminded moms and dads, you might consider setting up a play street, in which community members transform a residential city block a car-free space for children and families to play together, say, either weekly or monthly, or lobby schools to start their own play clubs, in which they keep their gyms or playgrounds open till dinnertime for self-directed free play. It’s true that unscheduling kids takes a lot more work than it did years ago. But after doing it, you may very well find that your family will be less stressed and happier. And plus, it’s the doctor’s orders.","It’s come to this: Doctors are now being told to prescribe play. The American Academy of Pediatrics details the urgency of the matter in a policy statement.

Adam Rosenberg,"We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V. World War II setting. New cooperative mode. New approaches to progression and personalization. No more premium pass. SEE ALSO: 'Battlefield V' brings huge changes, but maybe not what you're expecting All sorts of good stuff. But there's a lot more to share from our three-hour call with DICE on Monday. Little things that would never make it as a back-of-the-box bullet point, but which still communicate so much about how this new Battlefield is different from all the past Battlefields. So here you go: 7 things you can do in Battlefield V that you couldn't before. 1. Build up your base Fortifications are a thing now! Every soldier hits the battlefield with a tool kit in hand. You can use that tool kit in set locations — especially around capture points — to build resupply stations, sandbag walls, barbed wire fences, tank deterrents, foxholes... you name it. 2. Stick with your squad Squads are elevated to a whole new level of importance in Battlefield V. You've always had the ability to respawn on squadmates, but now you can go a step further and actually see where they are and what they're doing from an over-the-shoulder perspective before you spawn back in. You know how you used to spawn in on a squadmate only to be gunned down seconds later? That should happen a whole lot less in Battlefield V. 3. Anyone can revive now, sort of Medics are still very much the go-to soldier class for players that like to heal. They can revive any downed soldier quickly, bringing them back to full health and ready to fight in no time. But medics aren't the only way to escape death. Squadmates also have the ability to revive one another, regardless of class. It'll take longer to do the revive than a proper medic, and your buddy won't come back with all their health. But it's something. Especially since.... 4. You can drag downed teammates to safety Great news for medics and helpful squadmates alike: When you see a teammate bleeding out on the ground, you can lend a hand and drag them off to a safe location before you get to work on reviving them. It's especially helpful for squadmate revives, since those take longer (unless you're a medic). But everyone should benefit from not being caught in a situation where you're gunned down immediately after being revived. 5. Squad leaders can do cool stuff if they lead well It's not new that Battlefield's squad leaders get some measure of control over their squaddies: When you're the leader, you can issue non-verbal orders that highlight a particular capture/defend point or some other objective. Battlefield V takes that leadership a step further by giving every squad leader a radio. As your squaddies follow orders and complete objectives, you earn points. Earn enough points and you can spend them, via the radio, on all sorts of bonuses: Supply drops, smoke screen barrages, heavy weapons and tanks, and even rocket strikes. 6. Stationary weapons are stationary no more Fixed weapon emplacements like anti-air or anti-tank turrets are no longer locked in one location. In Battlefield V you're able to connect them to an assortment of vehicles and drag them around, trailer-style. 7. Soldier classes can be further specialized Battlefield's four core classes — Assault, Support, Medic, and Recon — are all back in Battlefield V, but that's only where your customization begins. New archetypes allow you to tailor your preferred class for different types of battle conditions. DICE didn't go too heavily into the specifics here, but these archetypes come with skill trees that look like they offer a significant amount of control over how you progress.","We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V.

Leigh Anderson,"Hey, Christmas is on Monday! The family holiday celebration is in two days and there’s exactly nothing under the tree for your niece, your mom, your brother and maybe even your own partner. Sure, you could hit the mall, but the stores are pretty picked over by now...and frankly, a lot of people don’t actually want any more stuff this holiday season. Enter the digital gift. For those of us living in cramped quarters, non-“thing” gifts are the only items on our wish lists to Santa. Gift certificates are the original non-thing presents, of course, but if you’re looking for new ideas, there are a million new virtual goods and services that won’t take up any space in the stocking (or on the plane ride home). Online Classes If you’ve got a autodidact in the family, check out the millions of virtual classes available on the internet. Take a look at Udemy for instruction in coding, business, or photography, among others; Babbel or LingQ for languages; Great Courses for science or history (and other) lectures from professors; or ArtistWorks for music lessons. Got a friend or a teen interested in standup? Check out Steve Martin’s online comedy workshop with Masterclass or Gold Comedy’s class for girls. Have a family member newly interested in yoga? Find classes for beginners all the way up to yoga master at Gaia. Want to up your game in the kitchen ? The Institute of Culinary Skills offers a knife-skills class for $105. If you're thinking of learning to code, the language you decide to pick up first has a lot to… Read more Read Museum or Sightseeing Memberships and Tickets I like gifts that people can use all year, like passes to local activities or attractions. If there’s a kid in your family who’s crazy about dinosaurs, consider a membership to the local natural history museum. Or a ten-pack of tickets to the zoo, ice-skating rink, or ski slope, or January tickets to the theater or opera. In my neighborhood there’s an indoor play space for kids that costs just a little too much; I would be thrilled with a five-pack of passes to get my kids through the worst of winter. Or if you’ve got a movie buff, consider a packet of tickets to the local cinema. Podcasts and Audiobooks Podcasts and audiobooks are the way to go if the giftee drives a lot or needs entertainment at the gym. If you’re keeping costs low this season, or if your recipient is new to podcasts, you can download your favorite episodes and make a “mix” for the recipient. If they’ve already got favorites, consider upgrading to the premium versions of their favorites (one Lifehacker staffer is getting Marc Maron ’s podcast for her dad; I’m getting a Slate Plus subscription with enhanced podcasts for one of my news junkie relatives.) For kids, Pinna offers a ton of options. Last year I gave my mom an Audible subscription.

You upload a model, choose your materials, and they’ll print and ship your design to you. Confused? There are tutorials, how-to’s, and “inspirations” from the community. Despite many people understanding the concept of 3D printing, few know the 3D design and printing… Read more Read Quality-of-Life Services I can’t afford to hire a real interior decorator, and I find them kind of intimidating anyway. Enter the virtual decorator: If you search Etsy for interior design services, your recipient can get online advice, mood boards, and shopping help to spruce up one room or the whole house. But before you consider redecorating, you might consider reorganizing: The National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals will help you find a professional organizer who will come to your house or and help you clear out your closets. For that matter, you can hire someone from TaskRabbit to come help out a family member who needs shelves put up or errands run ( here’s how to get a gift card for TaskRabbit.) If one of your friends has a new baby, a gift certificate for meal delivery from a local fancy-food shop, or for a house cleaning service, might just make their year. Homemade vouchers for babysitting are also always appreciated. Everyone loves a great podcast, including us! So imagine, if you will, that we’re handing you one… Read more Read Digital Entertainment For those friends who prefer to read on their Kindle or tablet, you can give a digital copy of your favorite book via Amazon or a CD via iTunes. This year I’m giving a friend a copy of Station Eleven and a Margo Price album. For the video gamers in your life, you might consider an app store gift card so they can buy extra power-ups or whatever in their favorite games. Amazon has somehow managed to create four different models of its Kindle ereader. Each of the four… Read more Read Bodywork If someone gave me some personal training sessions, or a gift card for a massage or pedicure, I would love them forever. You can call the spa or gym and likely get a gift certificate e-mailed in five minutes. Virtual Privacy If you’ve got a college student, they might appreciate a virtual private network to encrypt their communications and keep their data safe. This is likely the kind of gift that the recipient will want to participate in selecting and installing, but if you need some basic instructions, check out this how-to from Slate. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a great way to add security to your browsing while also… Read more Read Consumables How about the person who really doesn’t want any more things, but is still kind of a foodie? Beer / wine / cookie / oyster -of-the-month clubs extend the delicious treats of the holidays over a few months or a whole year, and if you’re lucky and you live close by, you can stop in on delivery day. Magazine and Newspaper Subscriptions Print magazines aren’t just for doctors’ offices, and your sibling might enjoy getting the New Yorker or the Atlantic, or Food and Wine. I got my husband a subscription to the Washington Post, which with Amazon Prime is free for six months and then $4 after. (Okay, that’s really a gift for me too.) Charitable Donations If you’re not keen at all on the consumerism of the holiday season and want to redistribute your resources a bit, consider a donation to a favorite charity in your family member’s name. Writing a note explaining why you thought they would support this particular charity can be a meaningful holiday communication in and of itself. An important aspect of having well-rounded finances is charity. Giving is generally accepted by… Read more Read The most important thing to remember is that you can get any of these with just a few minute’s notice—even a handwritten IOU is better than nothing.

THOMAS B. EDSALL,"However often President Trump strays from his favored political strategy, he faithfully returns to it like a dog to a bone: first, polarize the American electorate along racial, cultural and economic lines, then exploit the schisms that have supplanted the class divisions that were once central to both American and European partisan politics.
On one side of the divide are those whom the political scientists Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehartdescribe in a 2016 paper as comfortable with an inexorable cultural escalator moving postindustrial societies steadily in a more progressive direction. This new direction amounts to what the authors call
an intergenerational shift toward post-materialist values, such as cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism, generating rising support for left-libertarian parties such as the Greens and other progressive movements advocating environmental protection, human rights, and gender equality.
On the other side, Norris and Inglehart write, is a counterrevolution, a
retro backlash, especially among the older generation, white men, and less educated sectors, who sense decline and actively reject the rising tide of progressive values, resent the displacement of familiar traditional norms, and provide a pool of supporters potentially vulnerable to populist appeals.
Economic distress, they argue, reinforces cultural alienation to produce fertile terrain for Trump. Fears of economic insecurity, including the individual experience of the loss of secure, well-paid blue-collar jobs, and the collective experience of living in declining communities of the left-behinds combine to make voters
more susceptible to the anti-establishment appeals of authoritarian-populist actors, offering simple slogans blaming Them for stripping prosperity, job opportunities, and public services from Us. 
The collision of these forces has produced the emergence of an American authoritarianism. In their book, Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit and Authoritarian Populism, which comes out later this week, Norris and Inglehart write that Trump has assumed leadership of this authoritarian movement,
defined as a cluster of values prioritizing collective security for the group at the expense of liberal autonomy for the individual. Authoritarian values prioritize three core components: 1) the importance of security against risks of instability and disorder (foreigners stealing our jobs, immigrants attacking our women, terrorists threatening our safety); 2) the value of group conformity to preserve conventional traditions and to guard our way of life (defending Us against threats to European values); and 3) the need for loyal obedience toward strong leaders who protect the group and its customs (I alone can fix it,"" Believe me, Are you on my team?"").
The United States and many European countries, at various points in the last decade, have reached a critical juncture, Norris and Inglehart write: The interwar generation, non-college graduates, the working class, white Europeans, the more religious, men and residents of rural communities have come to feel estranged from the silent revolution in social and moral values, left behind by cultural tides that they deeply reject. These men and women, until recently the politically and socially dominant group in Western cultures, reached
a tipping point at which their hegemonic status, power and privilege is fading. Their values make them potential supporters for parties and leaders promising to restore national sovereignty (Make America Great Again), restrict immigration and multicultural diversity (Build a Wall) and defend traditional religious and conventional moral values.
The debate over whether the rise of right-wing populism is driven by cultural anxiety, racism, ethnocentricity or economic deprivation may be somewhat artificial, Norris and Inglehart contend because
interactive processes may possibly link these factors, if structural changes in the work force and social trends in globalized markets heighten economic insecurity, and if this, in turn, stimulates a negative backlash among traditionalists toward cultural shifts. It may not be an either/or question, but one of relative emphasis with interactive effects.
In this country, the nominally class-based politics of the New Deal fractured when working class non-college whites felt abandoned by a Democratic Party that shed its pre-civil rights, segregationist southern wing and that by the 1970s had adopted a culturally and racially liberal agenda. Over the past five decades, these white voters have formed the core of the populist right. Conversely, minorities, many of whom face the same economic hardships as working class whites, if not worse, are firmly aligned with the party of social and cultural liberalism and racial equality, the Democratic Party.
The new cultural cleavage dividing Populists and Cosmopolitan Liberals, Norris and Inglehart write, is orthogonal to the classic economic class cleavage in other words, the new division cuts across and splits the old economic class solidarity.
Data from a preliminary American National Election Studies survey provided to me by Matthew DeBell, a scholar at Stanfords Institute for Research in the Social Sciences revealed the strength of this new cleavage. The survey asked 2,500 men and women to rank their feelings toward Trump on a feeling thermometer scale of zero, very cold or unfavorable, to 100, very warm or favorable.","Encouraging and exploiting division has worked for Trump, as far as his own electoral prospects are concerned.

Rhett Jones,"On Friday morning, the Marriott hotel chain disclosed that its Starwood reservation system had experienced one of the largest data breaches of all time. By Friday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was already filed in a U.S. District Court. Law firm Morgan &amp; Morgan has asked a court in Maryland to grant a class action trial by jury accusing Marriott International Inc of negligence, breach of confidence, and deceptive and unfair trade practices. In a statement to Gizmodo, John Yanchunis, an attorney for the firm, told us: Large, sophisticated companies like Marriott are not blind to the risks posed by cyber criminals, who are constantly attempting to infiltrate corporations that store sensitive consumer information. The fact that a breach that began in 2014 went undetected for four years is shocking and horrifying. When guests stay at hotels, they trust the hotel will provide adequate security both physical and the protection of their private information. It appears that the trust 500 million people placed in Marriott/Starwood was violated for nearly half a decade. The hotel giant claims its still reviewing the extent of the breach to its system, but in a filing with the SEC it estimated that it exposed the personal information of around 500 million guests. That would make it the second biggest data breach of all time, just behind Yahoos devastating hack of 3 billion users. In Yahoos case, it took years to fully come clean about the extent of the breach. So far, Marriott has said it believes the Starwood system was first infiltrated in 2014, and it first detected an intrusion in September of this year. It claims that guest records that were stolen included: some combination of name, mailing address, phone number, email address, passport number, Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) account information, date of birth, gender, arrival, and departure information, reservation date, and communication preferences. It also said its looking into whether the hackers were able to get their hands on the security keys to decrypt the guests credit card numbers that were stolen. An FTC investigation of Marriott seems likely and the hotel said its working with law enforcement to track down the perpetrators. Well surely see more civil legal action come up as guests are notified and more information becomes available. Some victims of Equifaxs 2017 data breach even had some luck suing in small claims court.

Based on this representation, Instacart knew customers would believe their tips were being given to shoppers in addition to wages, not to supplement wages entirely.

Rhett Jones,"A probe of U.S. Navy sailors accused of distributing and using LSD is expanding. At least two men who worked in the nuclear reactor department on the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier are reportedly facing a court-martial, and at least 12 others are said to be under investigation over the psychedelic drug. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the probes existence back in February, but the Navy had little to say about it at the time. On Monday, Stars and Stripes claimed that two men were officially charged in August. From the report: Petty Officer 2nd Class Andrew Miller, a machinists mate, is accused of using, possessing and distributing LSD from January to February 2018, according to his charge sheet. Petty Officer 2nd Class Sean Gevero, an electricians mate, is accused of distributing LSD and possessing anabolic steroids in February, his charge sheet stated. A Navy spokesperson told the outlet that its initial investigation is over and that three other men have charges pending related to possession of controlled substances. The Journal previously reported that authorities in Japan (where the aircraft carrier was stationed) were also investigating the sailors under suspicion that they were distributing LSD to Japanese citizens but that case was allegedly dropped in June. On Tuesday, the Navy Times reported that the probe is larger than previously understood. A Navy spokesman confirmed to the Times that 10 other sailors in the nuclear reactor department were administratively disciplined on LSD-related charges. The spokesperson also said the mens previous work with nuclear fucking reactors has been reviewed and no improper work was identified. The Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo, but it seems safe to say that all the details on this case are not out at this point. Maybe its just a sign of the times, but its weird for this case to come up after a group of 14 troops from the Airforce were implicated in an LSD ring being run on F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The men were part of the 90th Missile Wing, which guards a third of the Minuteman 3 nuclear missiles that are housed in underground silos, ready to launch. Why is there a boom in psychonauts with such close proximity to total destruction? We do not know.

Sara Ashley O'Brien,"Four former Google employees, who previously worked in a range of roles at the company, have come forward as part of a revised gender-pay lawsuit filed on Wednesday. Three of the women were part of an earlier lawsuit filed in September alleging that female employees are paid less than their male counterparts. That suit was dismissed in December by a California judge who rejected the class action claim as overly broad. This newly filed suit more clearly defines the groups allegedly hindered by Google's unfair pay practices, including engineering, management, sales, and teaching roles. The new suit adds a fourth former female worker, Heidi Lamar, who was employed by Google as a teacher at Google's Children Center in Palo Alto from around July 2013 to August 2017. Google offers childcare and early education as a perk for its employees. Lamar claims that of the 150 teachers employed by Google during her tenure, just three were men. Two of the men hired were paid more than all but one of the women hired, she alleges. Related: Google notches a win in gender discrimination suit Lamar joins the original plaintiffs, Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease, and Kelli Wisuri. The women worked at Google in various capacities: Ellis as a software engineer; Pease in various management roles, and Wisuri in various sales roles. The suit seeks class action status, on behalf of women similarly situated at Google. Google said it disputes the allegations of a gender-based pay disparity at the company. ""We disagree with the central allegations of this amended lawsuit. We work really hard to create a great workplace for everyone, and to give everyone the chance to thrive here,"" said Gina Scigliano, a Google spokeswoman in a statement sent to CNNMoney. ""Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no bias in these decisions."" The Guardian was first to report on the new suit on Wednesday. The suit cites a U.S. Department of Labor analysis of data on 21,000 Google employees for 2015. ""That analysis found 'systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,'"" the complaint said. Google previously told CNNMoney its own analysis of its employees' compensation showed it had no gender pay gap, citing it pays women 99.7 cents to each dollar a man receives. It also makes its equal pay methodology available to other businesses to test their own compensation practices.

Josh Constine,"Priscilla Chan is so much more than Mark Zuckerberg’s wife. A teacher, doctor, and now one of the world’s top philanthropists, she’s a dexterous empath determined to help. We’ve all heard Facebook’s dorm-room origin story, but Chan’s epiphany of impact came on a playground. In this touching interview this week at TechCrunch Disrupt SF, Chan reveals how a child too embarrassed to go to class because of their broken front teeth inspired her to tackle healthcare. “How could I have prevented it? Who hurt her? And has she gotten healthcare, has she gotten the right dental care to prevent infection and treat pain? That moment compelled me, like, ‘I need more skills to fight these problems.'” That’s led to a $3 billion pledge towards curing all disease from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ’s $45 billion-plus charitable foundation. Constantly expressing gratitude for being lifted out of the struggle of her refugee parents, she says “I knew there were so many more deserving children and I got lucky”. Here, Chan shares her vision for cause-based philanthropy designed to bring equity of opportunity to the underserved, especially in Facebook’s backyard in The Bay. She defends CZI’s apolitical approach, making allies across the aisle despite the looming spectre of the Oval Office. And she reveals how she handles digital well-being and distinguishes between good and bad screen time for her young daughters Max and August. Rather than fielding questions about Mark, this was Priscilla’s time to open up about her own motivations. Most importantly, Chan calls on us all to contribute in whatever way feels authentic. Not everyone can sign the Giving Pledge or dedicate their full-time work to worthy causes. But it’s time for tech’s rank-and-file rich to dig a little deeper. Sometimes that means applying their engineering and product skills to develop sustainable answers to big problems. Sometimes that means challenging the power structures that led to the concentration of wealth in their own hands. She concludes, “You can only try to break the rules so many times before you realize the whole system’s broken.” [gallery ids=""1706485,1706479,1706480,1706481,1706483,1706484,1706492,1706491,1706487,1706486,1706478,1706477""]","Priscilla Chan is so much more than Mark Zuckerberg’s wife.

Lucas Matney,"One Denver-based startup’s long-shot bid to move today’s commercial jets beyond supersonic speeds just got a big injection of cash.
Boom Supersonic, which is building and designing what it calls the “worlds first economically viable supersonic airliner,” announced today that they’ve closed a $100 million Series B funding round led by Emerson Capital. Other investors include Y Combinator Continuity, Caffeinated Capital, SV Angel, Sam Altman, Paul Graham, Ron Conway, Michael Marks and Greg McAdoo.
The startup has raised $140 million to date.
“Today, the time and cost of long-distance travel prevent us from connecting with far-off people and places,” said Boom CEO Blake Scholl in a statement. “Overture fares will be similar to todays business classwidening horizons for tens of millions of travelers. Ultimately, our goal is to make high-speed flight affordable to all.
Alongside the fund raise, Boom is further detailing its plans to begin testing its Mach-2.2 commercial airliner this year. The company is aiming to launch a 1:3 scale prototype of its planned Overture airliner this year called the XB-1. The two-seater plane will serve to validate the technologies being built for the full-sized jet.
The startup’s supersonic Overture jet will hold 55 passengers, and the team hopes that the costs of flying more than double the speed of sound will be comparable to today’s business class ticket prices. $100 million may seem like a lot of money, but the development costs for lengthy projects like these can quickly race past estimates.

Lee Yancy,"EVE Online has once again been plunged into a major battle—possibly its biggest one ever, depending on how it all goes. At around 3 PM Eastern today, Keepstar-class Citadel (the single largest object that can be owned by a player in EVE) held by the Pandemic Horde alliance has come under attack, and is poised for destruction. Keepstars dwarf the games massive supercapital Titan warships, and cost well over three times as much to construct. To destroy this particular Keepstar, players from The Imperium have already launched three massive attacks against it over the past two weeks, leaving it in the vulnerable state we find it in today. The final assault is projected to be the largest engagement in EVE Online ’s volatile history, one that could see over a million dollars’ worth of in-game items destroyed. Thus far, the most famous and consequential battle in EVE was The Bloodbath of B-R5RB four years ago, which saw the Clusterfuck Coalition and their Russian allies fighting against the N3 Coalition. Over the course of the 21-hour battle, over 7,500 pilots were involved in the primary or secondary combats. A staggering 500 capital-class vessels were involved, each ship requiring at least a year of training time, and billions of in-game ISK to purchase. On top of these ships, each side had roughly 80 Titans, the games largest ships which require years of training time, and close to 100 billion ISK to purchase and properly equip. 75 of the Titans fielded at B-R5 were lost, helping to make the battle stack up to a real-world loss equivalency of around $300,000. There is a chance of this fight escalating into something that will go down in the history books. Today’s fight could make the battle of B-R5 look like a casual border skirmish in comparison. The players involved are aligned along very similar diplomatic lines to the battle four years ago. Defending the space station are the Pandemic Horde alliance, who are a creation of the leaders of the former N3 coalition. Defenders of the structure are also expected to include the remnants of the Moneybadger Coalition, who reside in the northern regions of the galaxy in close proximity to Pandemic Horde. The assaulting force, The Imperium, is led by the same group who led the Clusterfuck Coalition (CFC), the Goonswarm Federation. This is the group of people who came out victorious from B-R5, but have suffered through several military defeats in the years since then at the hands of the Moneybadger Coalition. In addition to being a very personal battle for many of the players involved, the fleets that have been prepared for this fight are nearly an order of magnitude larger than were involved in B-R5. The Imperium is expected to be capable of fielding over 250 Titan-class vessels, with their regular capital ships numbering in the thousands, though exact counts of these ships have been obfuscated by keeping the fleet in smaller parts while navigating them into place. In the hours leading up to the battle, Pandemic Horde and their allies slowly maneuvered defensive fleets into place as well, with reports showing that they could field similar numbers of capital ships as the Imperium. In addition to these capital ships, both sides in this fight have hundreds of smaller vessels supporting the fight in various ways. The Pandemic Horde alliance alone is reported to have over 650 Electronic Countermeasure Battleships on the field. These ships specialize in scrambling their opponents targeting computers preventing them from applying damage. As of now, the battle to decide the station’s fate has begun. The Imperium’s carriers and super-carriers have begun long-range bombardment of the station, and the defenders are attempting to stop the incoming damage in any way they can. Fleet commanders on both sides are maneuvering their ships in place and waiting for their counterparts on the other side to make a mistake and expose a weakness. Should one be exposed, then there is a chance of this fight escalating into something that will go down in the history books. As of this moment, the Keepstar is taking sufficient damage to prevent it from completing its 15-minute repair cycle. So long as this damage continues, the structure will eventually die. There are already over 6,000 players logged in to the system where the space station is currently holding on to life, with more continuing to pile in every minute. Reportedly, several thousand more players are waiting in the wings to jump into the fray and be part of history.","EVE Online has once again been plunged into a major battle—possibly its biggest one ever, depending on how it all goes.

"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","'Mrs.' by Caitlin Macy (Photo: Lee Boudreaux Books) In Caitlin Macy's new novel Mrs. (Lee Boudreaux Books, 352 pp., ★★★ out of four), we are reminded that class lines — while they may be superficial — run deep. Set on the Upper East Side, post-Bernie Madoff and the financial crisis, Macy's tale about the haves and the have-nots is as old as time. Though in this case the haves are worth billions and the have-nots are upper-middle-class Manhattanites. Our introduction to this world takes place outside prestigious St. Timothy’s, a Manhattan private preschool where mothers and nannies arrive ceremoniously to pick up their children. At the center of it all is Philippa Lye, who is married to Jedidiah Skinker, the wealthy scion of the last family-held investment bank in New York. Larger than life, Philippa is the sun that all the other women revolve around. A former model, Philippa is as mysterious and aloof as her past. We learn about Philippa’s ascent to the upper echelons of New York society through two other characters with the ""Mrs."" title. First there is Gwen Hogan, wife of Dan, a dogged prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Gwen’s middle-class upbringing makes her more at home with the teachers and nannies than the other mothers at St. Timothy's. And then there is Minnie Curtis, wife of John, a slick and well-known financier. A native of Spanish Harlem, she is a newcomer to both the school and wealth alike. It is through these two women, with a little help from their husbands, that we learn Philippa’s story. Author Caitlin Macy. (Photo: Deborah Copaken) Macy is deft at employing class to create conflict. By using multiple points of view and flashbacks, she weaves together a clever story that spurs the reader along. Each narrative provides a piece of the puzzle that is Philippa Lye, warts and all. Mrs. is a solid read, more entertaining than enlightening. But there is something missing. Gwen’s middle-class background is juxtaposed against the world of nannies, drivers and country homes, and her judgments and perceptions provide an entry point for the reader. But there is something lacking in Gwen. She is real, but she is not relatable. Or perhaps it is the under-development of the Greek chorus Macy employs to show the perceived difference in classes. The observations of this nameless group of mothers come so infrequently that they prove superfluous. What Mrs. does best is prove that class is mostly a state of mind, that the power of the rich derives from what we bestow on them, not from some innate birthright. Mrs. reminds us that the rich are not so different from you and me — they rise and fall just the same.

At 32, he is at the peak of a career that has taken him to stardom at Spurs and Real Madrid. He is also Croatia’s top passer, and the team rises and falls on his performance. Denmark vs. Croatia Top Story Lines • Croatia has advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup for the second time in its history. The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark’s first visit to the last 16 since 2002. • Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland. • With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game. • One of Denmark’s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, “What I can say about Eriksen is, he’s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He’s the most important player for Denmark.” The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension. • These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup.

Steve Dent,"Intel's future chips will have new layers of protection via something called ""partitioning,"" according to Krzanich. ""Think of this... as additional 'protective walls' between applications and user privilege levels to create an obstacle for bad actors,"" he said. The changes will start with Xeon Scalable ""Cascade Lake"" processors and 8th-generation Core chips shipping in the second half of next year. Intel didn't say if or how much the hardware changes would impact PC speeds, but Krzanich said that ""as we bring these products to market, ensuring that they deliver the performance improvements people expect from us is critical. "" Intel has been criticized for downplaying the extent and impact of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, especially when the news first broke.

Nick Douglas,"There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability. You can learn it from college courses, books, online resources—or from one of several growing boot camps for developers of all ages. We talked to the founders of two such boot camps: David Graham of Code Ninjas, for kids 7–14, and Michael Choi of Coding Dojo, for teens and adults. They explained their different approaches, both of which give their students the ability to build their own applications. Michael Choi learned to code in Korea at age 12, with help from a friend who would make whole computer games in a day. When he went to college, he found their computer science classes didn’t address his needs. His Coding Dojo program trains students in just 14 weeks. “Our goal is, how can we get people to be a self-sufficient developer?” says Choi. In the first 3–4 weeks, students learn to “think like a computer” with five core concepts: if/else statements, for loops, functions, variables, and object-oriented programming. The next 10 weeks are spent on learning specific languages, and how each language handles those five concepts. This part isn’t just useful for students learning to code for the first time, but also for working developers who want to expand their career options. “They spend their entire career using one language, but now they need to pick something new,” says Choi. Coding Dojo can train a developer in a new language in 3–4 weeks, says Choi, versus 6–9 months learning on their own. But most of the work is done in assignments, not lectures. One reason college courses didn’t work for him is that they involved long lecture. “People only retain about 20 minutes of lecture,” he says, so he boils lessons down as much as possible, assigning 4–5 hours of work based on that lecture. When you’re just starting to learn to code, it’s hard to tell if you’ve got the basics down and if… Read more Read While Graham’s Code Ninjas follows the same principle of learning through building, it works on a much longer scale. The full curriculum lasts 3–4 years, and kids progress through it like a martial arts program, earning colored belts as they complete different levels. Students learn every concept by using it to build a video game. They can even draw their own art for the game. This makes the class feel less like another school subject and more like a fun project—learning to code becomes a game in itself. The kids make some wild games, with things like characters who fart rainbows. “That was not in our original curriculum!” says Graham. “Their imaginations are endless. I thought it would be kind of paint by numbers. What we found out is that kids don’t have those boundaries and walls in their thinking that adults do.” He’s convinced that Super Mario Brothers, where plumbers stomp on mushrooms and turtles, must have been influenced by kids. Graham staffs the school with high school seniors and college students, who can relate to the kids better than adults would. (He also points out that because coding jobs pay so well, he just can’t afford to hire adult coders.) Graham emphasizes that his curriculum teaches real coding—“any kid can whip something up from a template,” he says, but a Code Ninjas black belt can build an app for the App Store from scratch. Or could—Choi has the full curriculum planned out, but Code Ninjas only opened in March 2017, so his first students have only reached the intermediate phase. (Code Ninjas is rapidly expanding, and currently lists 264 locations in 32 states.) Changing career paths, getting an idea for an app out of your head, or just learning something new… Read more Read Graham and Choi agree that young people have an advantage when learning to code. Graham, who has also taught adults to code, says that kids move faster because they’re just more used to soaking up knowledge and following instructions. “Critical thinking isn’t bad, but it doesn’t lend itself to learning as quickly.” Choi says that younger students might have a “slightly easier” time, but his students range from 16 to their 60s. Of course, you can learn to code without a camp. You can still teach yourself, or start solo before moving onto a camp or other social method. Choi recommends the tutorials at W3Schools, and the online edX version of Harvard’s CS50 course. But he warns about the latter, “It goes pretty deep pretty quickly.”","There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability.

"A.E. Dwyer on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Chicken stew on toast, however delicious, lacks sophistication. Now pour that stew into an elegant edible vessel? Thrilling. Crisp. Like a golden chalice of cream sauce. Now thats downright ladylike. The good news is even if youre not feeling particularly ladylike, this dish is scrumptious to all manner of persons. Meet Chicken à la Kinga dish so old, its new again.
According to The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Chicken à la King was not made for royalty, but rather the lunch set of Philadelphias fashionable Bellevue Hotel in the early 1900s. William King, a cook at the hotel, created the version that became his namesake, a dish that included truffle, red and green peppers. It was particularly appealing to the ladies who frequented the tea room, seen as a dainty dish that didnt require a knife to eat. Little did they know it contained about as many calories as a large cheeseburger.
My great-grandmother was a renowned family cook, who had attended The Antoinette Pope School of Fancy Cookery in Chicago. (Fun fact: Pope only charged 75 cents per class when she opened in 1930.) My great-grandmothers chicken creaming skills filtered down through her culinary education to my grandmothers dinner plate. And it stuck. After some tweaks, Chicken à la King became the default fancy dish made for Dwyer-family wedding buffets, elegant lunches, even the occasional Easter.
This recipe call for puff pastry shells, a nod to French pastry vol-au-vent: whisper-thin pastry cases used to contain rich bites of meats and creamed things. To me, they are a requirement to enjoying Chicken à la King, at least the first time around. The second day (when youre out of shells) youre allowed to go for a thick slice of toasted white bread. As kids, we would watch in awe as the pastry shellsor nests as they were marketed to usemerged from the oven, tall, golden and flaky. My sister and I managed to denude nest after nest of their small golden hats before we got caught.
The appearance of Chicken à la King is important: tender white meat chicken, silky white sauce, bright accent vegetables. No unsightly brown and grey bits of dark meat, nor even black pepper flakes, are allowed to besmirch the creamy whiteness. If you have it and you like it, use white pepper. Green peas add a fresh, sweet snap and pimentos add a subtle piquancy to the sauce. Drain those suckers wellwe dont want a pink tinted final dish, please.
Poaching in broth infused with carrot, celery, onion, peppercorn and thyme saves the chicken breast from being dry and flavorless. Bonus: Youll end up with tasty leftover stock, which can be chilled and frozen for soupy emergencies. 
Thickening with egg yolks became outmoded, when eggs were deemed pariahs for selfishly inflicting their cholesterol on our unwitting population. Now that yolks are cool again, I say bring them back as a thickener. Ill take my Vitamin D, lipids, and choline from yolks over canned soup goo any day.
So go ahead and make a fancy lunch for your friends. Make them my Chicken à la King, and put your best chicken foot forward.
1 package of Puff Pastry Shells (6 count), baked according to package instructions
For the chicken and poaching liquid:
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 bouillon cube or 4 cups chicken broth
1 small stalk celery, chopped in large chunks
1 small carrot, chopped in large chunks
1 wedge of onion, skinned
A few peppercorns or grinds of fresh pepper
A few thyme sprigs
Salt to taste
For the cream sauce:
1 stick of butter
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 cup whole or 2-percent milk
2 1/2 cups of reserved chicken poaching liquid
2 small jars of pimentos (2 oz. each), well drained
1 cup of frozen peas
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream
Salt to taste
Ground white pepper (optional)
Bring four cups of broth (or water with chicken bouillon cube added) to a simmer in a wide shallow pot with the lid. Add celery, carrots, onion, salt, pepper, and thyme and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and reduce heat to very low. After 15 minutes, check to see if chicken is cooked through, and remove the breasts from the broth. Continue cooking for another five minutes if chicken is not quite done yet.
Strain the broth and set aside 2 1/2 cups for your cream sauce. Discard the solids. 
Melt one stick of butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, then whisk in flour. Whisk thoroughly to combine, then let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally. Pour in milk and broth, and whisk to incorporate, making sure to whisk in any flour from the sides of the pan. Let cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Reduced the heat to keep the mixture warm.
In a bowl, combine the egg yolks and heavy cream, then slowly stir in 1/3 cup of the hot milk-broth mixture, mixing well. Pour this mixture back into your pot with the broth and whisk quickly to combine. This step will prevent the yolks from curdling. 
Cube your cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add chicken, pimentos, and peas to the broth mixture and stir, letting everything warm through. Taste and season with salt, adding a pinch of ground white pepper if desired.

WINNIE HU,"“It’s not fair, it’s not equitable,” she said. “All kids should have access to all the schools — and not because you live in a certain neighborhood and your parents have access to certain resources.” At the request of parents and local elected officials, the city education department spent $150,000 to hire an urban planning firm, WXY Studio, to lead a community process to come up with a way to integrate the middle schools. Hundreds of parents and educators have worked collaboratively over the past year — largely avoiding the drama of District 3 — on a plan that will be presented this summer. In District 3, a battle erupted two years ago when school zones were redrawn to reduce crowding and increase diversity at elementary schools. One of the schools involved was Public School 199, a high-performing elementary school on the Upper West Side where parents hire tutors to ensure their children excel on state tests, and where the angry meeting caught on video took place. The district’s middle-school effort has drawn a variety of criticisms from parents. Some say it is unfair, since there are not enough seats for all the qualified applicants at the top schools, and that it could lower the quality of education. Others say it doesn’t do enough to help lower-performing middle schools. Robin Aronow, a school consultant, said that she had received a flood of calls from parents who are anxious about the plan and are considering applying to private schools in addition to public schools. City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Democrat from the Upper West Side, said the goal should be to increase the academic and economic diversity in every school, though she also understood the concerns raised by some white, middle-class parents. “This is about, ‘I don’t want to lose a spot for my kid,’” she said. Under the plan that was initially unveiled, every District 3 school would offer 10 percent of its sixth-grade seats to students who average a 1 on state tests — the lowest grade on a 1-to-4 scale — and another 15 percent to those who average a 2. For the current school year, only 11 percent of Booker T. Washington’s 299 admission offers went to these students.","At the Booker T. Washington Middle School, less than a quarter of the students are black or Hispanic, in a district where children from those groups make up half the population.",2018-05-17T22:09:48Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘It Has to Start Somewhere’: Grass-Roots Drive to Integrate New York Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/nyregion/it-has-to-start-somewhere-grass-roots-drive-to-integrate-new-york-schools.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/nyregion/18DESEG1/00deseg-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1
Mark Kaufman,"Tesla might sell more all-electric vehicles than any other car manufacturer in the U.S., but automotive industry veteran Bob Lutz warns the company could soon go broke. The 85-year old Lutz's candid thoughts were reported last week by The Los Angeles Times as the former Vice Chairman of General Motors spoke to a group of vintage car collectors. SEE ALSO: BMW to challenge Tesla with super long-range electric SUV In Lutz's view, Tesla's vehicles — like its high-speed Model S sedan — could soon become valuable collector's items when Tesla's business model fails. Lutz apparently believes Tesla ""hasn’t figured out the revenues have to be greater than costs … when you are perennially running out of cash you are just not running a good automobile company.” Accordingly, he suggested that collectors pick up a sleek Model S while they're still being produced inside Tesla's Northern California factory: ""I don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to fix that, so those of you who are interested in collector cars may I suggest buying a Tesla Model S while they’re still available,"" Lutz said. One critical factor that might fix Tesla's revenue problem (it reported a $619 million third-quarter loss in 2017), however, is the increased production and sales of its first affordable class vehicle, the Model 3. Tesla hopes to sell this vehicle at around $35,000, which will compete with Chevy's increasingly popular fully electric Chevy Bolt — which outpaced the pricier Model S as the most sold all-electric vehicle in the U.S. in October 2017. The Model 3 experienced well-publicized production woes in late 2017, with Telsa's often confident CEO Elon Musk admitting the company was mired in ""production hell."" Lutz might be skeptical about Tesla's financial stability, but he still speaks highly of its vehicles, specifically the Model S: ""A Model S, especially with the performance upgrades, is one of the fastest, best handling, best braking sedans that you could buy in the world today. The acceleration times will beat any $350,000 European exotic."" But a Model S starts at $68,000, and most consumers don't care about speed — they value reliability and reasonable costs. If Tesla wants to prove Lutz wrong, the company will almost certainly need to show robust Model 3 sales this year. Fortunately for Elon Musk, there are some 400,000 people on the waiting list — including his own mother.","Tesla might sell more all-electric vehicles than any other car manufacturer in the U.S., but automotive industry veteran Bob Lutz warns the company could soon go broke.

When people are buying thousands of dollars of cryptocurrencies at a time, Coinbase’s 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US can quickly add up.

It’s stylish, retro-future Tron interface is also a super easy way to check on pricing and news about 16 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Stellar, Qtum, Bitcoin Gold, OmiseGo, NEO, Lisk, and Dogecoin. Robinhood Crypto first announced the feature last month, with one million people signing up in just the first four days. That interest has driven Robinhood’s total registered user count to over 4 million, up from 3 million in November. Those users have transacted over $100 billion to date, saving $1 billion in commission fees. On most stock trading services like E*Trade and Scottrade, customers pay around $7 per trade to cover these companies’ marketing, physical branches, and sales reps. Founded in 2013, Robinhood ditches those fees by running a lean operation centered around engineers and its app. It makes money on the interest of cash its customers keep with it, or by selling monthly Robinhood Gold subscriptions that let users borrow money to trade with. That business has allowed the startup to raise $176 million, most recently at a $1.3 billion valuation. And with its free crypto trading, it may have found a way to luring in a fresh class of amateur investors.

Matthew Lynley,"As the vacation rental sector heats up — with Airbnb making even more moves to expand its portfolio of services to include multiple tiers of rentals — there’s going to be more and more of a need for people who manage a large number of properties. Guesty is one service that aims to do that, and today a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission notes that it’s raised $19.75 million in a new Series B round of financing. While Airbnb may be the dominant home vacation rental service, there are others like VRBO, and managing those properties across multiple different platforms could require handling all of that information in something more analog like an Excel sheet. It’s a kind of CRM tool for property management, ranging from tracking guest check-ins to the amount of revenue a property owner. Guesty also helps property owners by providing tools to manage operations beyond just the tracking. Airbnb earlier this year started rolling out more tiers of home categories that are geared toward different kinds of travelers. That included high-end tiers called Airbnb Plus and Beyond by Airbnb. While these new categories potentially offer a more granular set of choices for consumers, it might make managing those properties a little more difficult — especially if it’s across multiple different services like Airbnb and VRBO, or even more analog channels. Tools like Guesty can help owners of multiple different properties (that might span multiple tiers) turn those homes into an actual business. There are also plenty of platforms that are looking for additional services for people managing multiple properties on vacation rental sites. There are startups like Beyond Pricing, which look to help property managers figure out how to best price their homes. Airbnb has its own pricing algorithms, but there’s clear demand for tools that cross multiple platforms. Guesty was party of Y Combinator’s winter 2014 class, and raised $3 million in May last year. While Airbnb continues to try to expand into new categories and offer home owners a way to rent out their homes — or for owners of multiple properties to run a side business — it’s not the only approach to vacation rentals. One startup, Selina, is looking to convert existing properties into kinds of campuses that cater to different tiers of travelers, ranging from travelers looking to stay in a hostel to ones that are willing to pay for their own rooms. Selina earlier this month said it raised $95 million. Selina is more of a hotel-ish model as it expands from geography to geography, but it also shows that there’s demand for an experience that can cater to a wide variety of guests.",As the vacation rental sector heats up — with Airbnb making even more moves to expand its portfolio of services to include multiple tiers of rentals — there’s going to be more and more of a need for people who manage a large number of properties.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / An employee pushes a trolley with a Vizio Inc. high-definition television (HDTV) at a Target Corp. store on Black Friday in Dallas, Texas, on Friday, Nov. 24, 2017. reader comments 4 In what is likely a first in the industry, Vizio is on the verge of agreeing to display a class-action lawsuit message through its previously sold ""Smart TV"" televisions as part of a legal settlement. This message is meant to alert customers who bought the TV that they will be party to the forthcoming settlement and likely will get a small amount of money. As Ars has reported previously, the manufacturer has been under scrutiny since a 2015 revelation that it was snooping on its customers. The tracking started in February 2014 on both new TVs and previously sold devices that didn't originally ship with ACR software installed. The software periodically appended IP addresses to the collected data and also made it possible for more detailed personal information—including age, sex, income, marital status, household size, education level, home ownership, and home values—to be associated. Eventually, the company agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission. However, this new settlement is related to an entirely separate lawsuit, one that was consolidated in federal court in Los Angeles. In a court filing submitted last Wednesday, lawyers for both sides asked the judge to push back approval of the preliminary settlement to October 3. ""The Parties are developing a class notice program with direct notification to the class through VIZIO Smart TV displays, which requires testing to make sure any TV notice can be properly displayed and functions as intended,"" they wrote. ""The additional time requested will allow the parties to confirm that the notice program proposed in the motion for preliminary approval is workable and satisfies applicable legal standards.""

Nick Douglas,"This is not the Detroit of the 1980s, says D-town10. Youre not going to get shanked or robbed or whatever negativity youve heard about the city. Also, youll have to excuse the construction going on. Were in the middle of a resurgence! Lets get into the best responses to our request for Detroit travel tips. Each Monday on Hack Your City, we ask readers for your best tips on a city: driving tips, restaurant recs, things to do, and any other advice for visitors and locals. Then on Thursday, we present the best comments. Were working our way around the U.S. and around the globe. Eat and Drink More Middle Eastern restaurants than you can imagine of all price ranges. Anything from $3 shawarma sandwiches to multi-course meals depending on the place. Many of the best are in Dearborn (near Henry Ford Museum). That one guy who says stuff For something delicious and different check out a Yemeni restaurant, like Sheeba on Michigan Ave. Jerseygirltoo If youre downtown, Checker Bar is great. Deluxx Fluxx is the most recent cool bar thats opened. Flessica Jetcher Lots of good beer both in the city itself (Batch, Founders, Eastern Market Brewing, Atwater, Motor City Brewing Works) and the near suburbs (Griffin Claw, Urbanrest, River Rouge). Theres a ton more breweries in greater Detroit (Drafting Table and Witchs Hat are some of my favs). DuhJango I really loved the vibe at the Z Lot and The Belt, which is a parking garage and alley that have been transformed into an art gallery filled with trendy watering holes. Tamstarz Micro distilleries are, I feel, a little more unique to Detroit: Detroit Distillery, Rusted Crow (Steamscicle), Two James (Grass Widow Bourbon), and Valentines (vodka) just to name a few. They are staffed by mixologists who will make you something out of this world with some of their signature liquors. Matt Food: Shangri-La (Chinese), Standby (cocktails/burgers), Cornerstone (whiskey/gastropub), Bucharest (shawarma), Pop &amp; Offworld (arcade/pizza), Nikis (pizza/Greek), Roast (Michael Simons steakhouse), any taco place in Southwest, Mudgies (deli/sandwiches). D-town10 If you like Mexican, you have to go to Evies Tamales. Its in a tiny little Mexican neighborhood right next to the highway. Some of the best stuff Ive ever had, from tamales to tacos to steak milanesa. Theyll give you free cookies after you eat; if you like them, just head down the street to the authentic bakery that makes them, La Gloria. I didnt get paid for this post, but I wish I had been, in tamales. WinnieTheWoot Evies will sell you quart containers of their fillings for super cheap. Take home several pounds of their shredded chicken and divide it up into meal sized portions in your freezer. Quasi Hatrack See and Do Go to the Detroit Jazz Festival before you die. Great atmosphere right on the water, world class food, world class music, walking down the streets with musicians playing on every corner and the soul of Detroit in full swing is hard to beat. jesse1235 The architecture is amazing around here. My favorite theater is the Fox, with its gorgeous ceiling. Theres quite a few building tours (free) you can sign up for and look at the art deco. You can even tour the Packard plant (not free) (also, Packard plant has security, so unless youre a die hard urban adventurist, its hard to get in) (obviously, people have gotten in before). sarmckay Visit the Motown Museum. adgorn Omg the Rivera murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts! AllenaT Goodnight asks: Is techno still alive and well in Detroit? Milky answers: Very much so. TV lounge always a show. Marble Bar gets some of the best DJs. Leland City Club is where the goth kids go (but its great). Theres often shows at El Club and the Russell Industrial Center. EDM is up in Pontiac at Elektricity. Grasshopper in Ferndale always has a DJ too. Hell, Motor City Wine has a great DJ play for free once a week. And of course Movement, when world class DJs come to Detroit and take over every venue for the whole weekend. Im embarrassed to admit this, but theres a Goop city guide to Detroit and its actually pretty good. We went to the Old Miami for music, visited Belle Isle, had beer at Batch Brewing, did dinner at Grey Ghost, wandered around Eastern Market on Sat morning, and saw the Heidelberg Project. witsylany Detroit Historical Museum and Institute of Arts Museum: Right across the street from each other, and next to the beautiful city library. Cheap or free admission and inexpensive parking nearby. Learned some interesting stuff about the history of Detroit, military and trading importance, and how all the ingredients came together to be a major city of industry. Dave Greenfield Village is much of the same as the Henry Ford Museum, but outside and can easily eat up another day or two. Thomas Edisons Menlo Park lab, the Wright Brothers workshop, and more are literally disassembled, shipped, and rebuilt into the worlds most historic little theme park. That one guy who says stuff Go to Corktown, Mexitown and Hamtramck. Milky I enjoy strolling around the Hart Plaza area. There are some great sculptures there, including the Michigan Labor Legacy site, a memorial to the Underground Railroad, the Joe Louis monument, the Spirit of Detroit statue, Borglums (the guy who carved Mount Rushmore) Lincoln sculpture, and the Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac statue. Jerseygirltoo If you like cars, try to attend the Woodward Dream Cruise in August. Image a car show that stretches down Main Street only that Main Street is 20 miles long and four lanes wide. So Shiney Get Around Perhaps it is the population density (still well below what the expressways can manage) or just the history of being the home of the auto, but I love driving in Detroit. Turn the radio up, hit the road and you will never feel more American. TheMeanestSnowflake Were right next to Canada, so be aware of the signs on the freeways, or else youre heading across the river. sarmckay We found the city to be very bikeable. From Midtown we were able to bike all around downtown and out to Belle Island. There were ample bike lanes and traffic was a lot friendlier than what I am used to in my hometown. J Will Parking downtown does suck, but try the casinos. Im not 100% sure about what drives their free parking, but sometimes its free, sometimes its not. Drive by and give it a shot. Weve got those damn scooter thingies now, so its not as hard to get into actual downtown from the outskirts. CaptainSlooow Like most cities, nicer hotels are pricey, but unlike most cities, its actually pretty easy to get to and around the city if you choose to stay outside downtown.

Sean Kim,"What does it take to build a world-class team ? Not just in business, but in every aspect of our lives? New York Times Bestselling Author, Daniel Coyle, went on a multi-year journey to get to the bottom of this question. He studied the U.S Navy Seals, top NBA basketball teams, and world-class teams from IDEO and discovered a common pattern within all of these studies. This is a never-ending journey that I'm going through with my own company, Rype. I sat down with Daniel to learn how we can all improve our team's culture through simple and actionable steps. Listen to this full interview with Daniel on how he came up with the research, what he discovered, and more. ""We tend to think that great culture is like DNA - some groups have it and some don't. As it turns out, that's not true. Great culture is something you can learn."" -Daniel Coyle For those of you that want the highlights, here are the 3 main factors he discovered. 1. Build Safety The first thing that surprised me during my conversation with Daniel is that great culture can be learned. It's not an inherent DNA that founders are born to create. Safety is the most important foundation to establish in order for the other two factors to function properly. When employees or managers don't feel safe, it creates barriers and limitations within the organization. It leads to employees playing it safe when they should be encouraged to experiment and innovate. When Daniel contrasted a group of kindergartners versus CEO's trying to accomplish a task, the former was far more effective. The reason being, there was no pre-set agenda or egos that kindergartners had to overcome. All they cared about was getting to the right answer. Action step: Be overly generous with complementing your team members, even if it feels excessive. Doing this is far more beneficial than not saying 'thank you' enough when it most matters. 2. Share Vulnerability The second step to building a world-class culture is to be vulnerable. The way to do this effectively is to lead by example and share your mistakes upfront. Make it as clear as possible for everyone in the team to hear. When the leader confronts his or her own faults, it enables the rest of the team to feel safe to do the same. Action step: In your next meeting, own up to your mistakes, and be conscious of listening first before responding with your own thoughts. In other words, allow others to control the conversation when necessary. 3. Establish Purpose As we all know, having a common aligned purpose is what great teams thrive on. Without a common mission, it's going to be an obstacle to overcome the inevitable difficult times that are thrown your way. Action step: When in doubt, over communicate the vision and repeat it as much as you possibly can. As you scale your team, you'll eventually enable your team members to communicate the company's purpose to new members. Over the long run, world-class teams will always outperform the product or service that's being presented.

AJ Dellinger,"At this point, it’s no secret that the butterfly keyboard used on newer models of Apple’s MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops have a litany of issues. Apple might be the last to recognize it, but the company is finally offering its customers free fixes for issues stemming from the flawed keyboard design. Owners of MacBooks dating back to early 2015 and MacBook Pros from 2016 and newer will have the ability to get a number of common keyboard-related issues fixed for free from Apple through a new service program. For those who have already forked over cash for repairs, Apple will offer a refund. According to Apple, the program will address letters or characters on the keyboard repeating unexpectedly, letters not appearing when a key is pressed, and keys feeling sticky or not responding in a consistent manner—all issues that users of Apple’s new laptops have likely encountered at some point. Per Apple ’s notice announcing the service program, here’s the full list of models that are eligible for the service program: MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015) MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016) MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017) MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016) MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017) Owners of those devices will be able to take their laptop to an Apple Store or any Apple Authorized Service Provider to receive repairs, which will be provided free of charge (though it’s worth noting that Apple has a habit of finding other issues that need to be fixed first with a device, and the company will happily charge for addressing those problems.) Apple warned that servicing the issues may require replacing individual keys or the entire keyboard. If the place you take your laptop doesn’t have the parts on site, you may be without your laptop for a few days. The service program amounts to the first time Apple has really acknowledged what owners of the MacBook and MacBook Pro are already aware of: the butterfly keyboard design sucks. First introduced in 2015, the butterfly keyboard doesn’t look any different than Apple’s old scissor-style keyboards, but the mechanism under the key itself is different. The butterfly design shortens the “travel” required to register a keystroke and allowed Apple to slim down the design of its laptop. The company hyped the mechanism by claiming the keyboard design is “four times more stable” than its standard, scissor mechanism. The bigger problem is that there’s almost no margin for error under the keycaps. If a crumb or especially large spec of dust lodges under a key the key will just stop working. Unfortunately, the results have underwhelmed and the keyboard has become one of the top complaints about Apple’s newest laptops, as something as small a crumb sneaking under a key can render it useless. It’s not uncommon for the mechanism to get stuck, and some users have reported hearing high-pitched sounds when pressing keys at times. The issue has been so bad that users have taken to banding together in hopes of getting Apple’s attention. More than 31,000 people have signed a Change.org petition demanding Apple recall MacBooks with the butterfly keyboard, and the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit over the design earlier this year. Apple’s service program may quell some of the complaints but may still need to go back to the drawing board for the keyboard design on future models of its laptops.

Pete Pachal,"The future of the car is driverless. Everyone knows this, and it was on full display at CES 2018, with a host of companies showing off why their particular flavor of self-driving was better than the company just a few feet over on the Las Vegas Convention Center parking lot. The thing is, true self-driving cars — ones that can drive on any street and take you door to door — are likely still several years away. The not as revolutionary but more immediate trend in automotive technology that will change the way we drive in the next few years are connected cars. SEE ALSO: 3 security issues facing self-driving cars The next generation of cars will have always-on mobile connections and internal sensors, and that's leading automakers to re-imagine in-car experiences with touchscreens, voice interactions, and even gesture control. It sounds impressive and usually looks really sleek, but, based on what I tried out at CES, the dashboards of the future may not be what we want, or even be a very good experience overall. The upgrade car owners will feel the soonest is in tech that's already commonplace on dashboards: touch. However, the touchscreens of tomorrow will be a leap ahead of the lag-ridden resistive touchscreens that are the norm in cars today (touch-first UIs like Tesla's notwithstanding): They're going to be much more closer to the capacitive multitouch experiences that we're used to on iPhones and iPads. The dashboard as an iPad The poster child for these is the 2018 Mercedes A-Class. Shipping very soon, the new car features a 10-inch touchscreen that's big but not too big, and as responsive as a smartphone. The UI has large iconography that's designed not to distract, and it's very customizable: You can even set it to display virtually nothing while you drive (which would be my preference). The dashboard on the new Mercedes A-Class makes voice and touch the primary ways to interact. Image: Pete Pachal/Mashable Dashboards like the A-Class's make me uneasy, though, since they ditch most hard buttons altogether. This isn't a trend I'm a fan of, mostly because I find keeping your eyes on the road is easier if you can find your way around a dashboard with touch. Of course, that's why the A-Class also features conversational voice interactions, letting you just talk to your car to do things like play music or turn on the AC. More on that in a minute. As far as big-screen dashboards go, the most outlandish one I saw was on Byton's SUV concept. The 40-inch(!) display is recessed, and it stretches from one side of the windshield to the other. It's not a touchscreen; instead the driver controls everything with buttons and touchscreen on the steering wheel. While the car's stopped, though, the Byton activates a new kind of interaction: gestures. You can point and select things on the screen with your fingers, just like you'd do with Microsoft Kinect. That's a UI experience I've never found satisfying, and if it were used to control car functions it would be downright dangerous, but thankfully Byton was wise enough to deactivate gesture control while the car is in motion. Look whose car is talking Forget touching and pointing at screens, though; in the end, what we really want is to simply talk to our cars and have them do things for us. Basically, we want Alexa in the car. A number of automakers have already announced they're working on exactly that, but CES saw them grow in rank, including Toyota, the world's largest car manufacturer. Panasonic announced it would work to bring both Alexa and Google Assistant to the infotainment systems it provides to carmakers. At least a few auto manufacturers, however, think they can craft a better voice experience for their own cars, and one of their demos — the Mercedes A-Class I mentioned above — has me almost convinced. The in-car assistant was great at parsing natural language and inferring intent. Instead of saying clinical instructions like, ""Mercedes, lower the cabin temperature by 2 degrees,"" you can just say, ""Mercedes, it's hot,"" and it'll perform the same action. Cuing up specific songs, genres, and radio stations was just as easy and natural. I also got a chance to sample the voice experience in the latest Toyota Camry XLE, which uses voice-recognition tech from a company called Voicebox. Again, it could interpret natural commands like, ""I really need to call Sam."" The Toyota Camry XLE dashboard, with voice interactions powered by Voicebox. Image: Pete Pachal/Masahble The promise of all these systems is that, as cars get connected, the experience can be updated anytime. Tesla has been offering over-the-air software updates for a long time, and other automakers have been following suit. When 5G becomes a reality, the trend will only accelerate. Many of these interfaces are bumpy. When I was in the Mercedes it had a hard time understanding the word ""jazz."" The Byton's gesture control looks like a disaster. And there are still questions about security and privacy to be worked out.

In 2005 the first A380 was unveiled at the Airbus factory in Toulouse, France. 
This is the first time an A380 took to the skies. The aircraft's maiden flight was on April 27, 2005 in Toulouse. 
Cold weather testing of the A380. Anyone else feel the desire to photoshop some AT-ATs or maybe a snow speeder or two in there?

The A380 is often accused of looking hydrocephalic because Airbus put the cockpit on the lower level. That may be true, but the complex geometry of its wing is pure art.

The A380 cockpit. I'm not sure if the sheepskin seat covers are standard, or just an Emirates thing. 
Oh, I guess they all have sheepskin seats. This is the cockpit of a British Airways A380. 
Some A380 operators configure them to offer a bar to business and first class passengers. This is the bar on an Emirates Airlines A380.

No, this isn't a shot of someone's quarters on NCC-1701D, it's is a promo shot of Singapore Airline's new first class suite. Lee Hutchinson says he's determined to try out the suite (or maybe Emirates version) at least once before he's too infirm to leave the sofa. ""Preferably without even a stopjust get off one plane and get back on the other. that way i dont even have to care about the time zones or do any clock adjustment,"" he told Ars. 
Yet another insane Singapore Airlines A380 suite. I think I agree with Lee on this one 
Ok, you saw the official Singapore Airlines press shots, now this is what it actually looks like. 
This is what a Singapore Airlines first class suite looked like in 2009. 
Singapore Airlines also has a rather fancy bathroom in first class upstairs. 
Thai Airways' A380 business class cabin is extremely purple. 
British Airways business class on an A380 can feel a little dour.

Three jet bridges connect to an Emirates Airlines A380 at JFK. Not every airport is able to accommodate these massive carbon composite skywhales. 
This must be downstairs on a Lufthansa Airbus 380 because it's a 3-4-3 layout. 
On Valentine's Day, Airbus confirmed that production of the massive A380 airliner will come to an end, breaking some plane nerds' hearts. When it was unveiled to the world in 2005, Airbus touted its efficiency over twin-engined long-haul planes, but this mighty carbon-fiber double-decker never lived up to expectations. Not all airports could accommodate its physical size, and getting the self-loading cargo on and off could take a while.
Unlike the 747, it doesn't appear set to have a continued career carrying cargo, either. You'd expect the biggest passenger plane of the skies to make a pretty decent freighter. But there's no folding nose variant, so you can't take full advantage of its commodious interior to carry really big stuff. In 2021, the last A380 will depart final assembly in Toulouse, France. By then, more than 300 of these carbon composite skywhales should have been delivered, and so we expect they'll remain a regular sight at airports they already service.
The Airbus superjumbo never really captured the public's heart the way the 747 has, and there's no denying the decision to put the cockpit on the lower deck gives the plane a hydrocephalic appearance. But the complex curvature of the wing is a thing of beauty, and it's always wonderful to see something so large land so gracefully. (If you time your visit to the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy annex for the right time of day, you can watch them come in up on the observation deck.)
Flying long-distance in an A380 can be an opulent affair. Both Singapore Airlines and Emirates have private first class suites on board, and the flying barfirst seen on the original jumbo jethas made something of a comeback, too. The promo shots have a certain air of ""crew quarters on NCC-170D,"" although you'll see from the gallery(or on YouTube) that they're a little smaller than that. Further aft things are more spartan, and pick the upper deck because the 2-4-2 layout is less cramped than downstairs' 3-4-3.
I've only been fortunate enough to fly an A380 once (of late 747s appear to be the preferred type for Dulles to Heathrow). But that one trip made me fall for the big plastic bird. It was a quiet and smooth ride, and the bathrooms at the front of the upper deck were bigger than the bathrooms of some houses I've lived in. Here's to you, you majestic flying cruise liner.

"Steve Garrison steve.garrison@nwi.com, 219-853-2563","CROWN POINT — A man faces charges after his toddler daughter shot her pregnant mother with his gun Tuesday outside Plato's Closet in Merrillville, court documents state. Menzo M. Brazier, 21, of Michigan City, was charged Thursday in Lake Criminal Court with two counts each of criminal recklessness and neglect of a dependent. Police were dispatched about 3:38 p.m. Tuesday to Plato's Closet, 359 E. 81st Ave., for reports of a gunshot wound. Officers found Brazier at the store holding a blood-soaked towel against his pregnant girlfriend's chest, according to court records. The woman had a gunshot wound that entered the upper right side of her back and exited near her collar bone. The woman was transported to Methodist Hospitals Southlake Campus and then Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois, where she was treated in their intensive care unit, records state. She told police in a statement her 3-year-old daughter accidentally shot her with her boyfriend's gun. The father told police his girlfriend was sitting in their vehicle with their children, ages 3 and 1, while he was shopping for pants inside Plato's Closet. He said he did not want to bring his loaded 9 mm handgun into the store, so he put it between the front passenger seat and center compartment. He said he was inside shopping when someone entered the store and said a woman outside was bleeding. He went outside and found his wounded wife leaning against the side of their car. Brazier allegedly admitted the gun was loaded, but claimed a bullet was not chambered. He said he told his daughter not to touch his guns or knives, records state. Brazier was wanted by police on a warrant for failure to appear in Porter County Superior Court on traffic violations, records state. The defendant was arrested on the warrant. He remains held without bond at Lake County Jail, records state.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Samsung/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Sometimes the storage that's built into a device just doesn't cut it — That's where microSD cards come in to expand your device's storage. Many Android smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support microSD cards, as do all GoPro action cameras and some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Whether you need a microSD card for your smartphone, action camera, mobile-gaming console, or something else entirely, we've got the microSD card for you. Before we get into our top picks, here are all the terms and specifications you need to know to buy the right microSD card for your device. Card Type and capacity When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically pack 64GB to 2TB. Although most devices accept the SDXC standard for microSD cards with 32GB or more, some devices still only accept lower capacity SDHC microSD cards. Some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo 3DS only support SDHC cards for 32GB or less. Most phones support SDXC cards with 64GB or more. Be sure to check which format your device supports. Speed Class SD Association Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below. SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s. It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll want a class 10 microSD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification. UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s. Finally, there's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card. All the microSD cards in this guide are U3 or U1. App performance class for smartphones and tablets The App Performance Class denotes which MicroSD cards are best for smartphones and tablets. An A1 rating means that the card can open apps and process apps quickly, because it can handle a random read input-output access per second (IOPS) of 1,500 and write IOPS of 500. A1 cards are new, and anyone who wants to use Google's ""Adoptable Storage"" feature, which formats your card as internal storage in an Android device, should look for the new rating. The right microSD card for your device Depending on what you're using your microSD card for, you'll want a different capacity. For smartphone users: A 16GB or 32GB SDHC microSD card is fine for most smartphone users, because you'll probably be using it to store photos, videos, and big mobile games. You shouldn't fill up a 32GB card too fast. If you like to shoot 4K video on your phone, then you have to buy an SDXC microSD card that has a U3 speed class rating and at least 64GB of storage. Many phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support SDXC microSD cards with up to 256GB of storage. For the Nintendo Switch and 3DS: Thankfully, the Nintendo Switch accepts SDXC microSD cards with up to 2TB of storage onboard. Since games take up a ton of storage, we recommend you get a high-capacity card for your Switch. If you have a Nintendo 3DS, you cannot buy an SDXC card. The console only supports SDHC cards with 32GB or less storage. For GoPro users: If you need a microSD card for your GoPro, consult the company's list of recommended cards. The site says that GoPros require a minimum of Class 10, but U1 or U3 are better speed classifications. The HERO camera only supports a 32GB SDHC microSD card, but the HERO 3 Black Edition, HERO 3+, HERO+, and HERO+ LCD cameras support SDXC microSD cards with up to 64GB of capacity. Meanwhile, the HERO 4 and HERO Session cameras are compatible with SDXC microSD cards of up to 128GB. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links.

Jeffrey Van Camp,"There's a Sonos sale going on right now. We're big fans of Sonos speakers here on the WIRED Gear team. The speakers often have best-in-class audio, and they're designed entirely around the idea of building a network of speakers in different rooms of your home. Sonos has been making connected audio equipment for more than a decade now, and the company supports its products for long stretches of time; someone who bought a Sonos amp in 2005 can probably play Spotify on the thing today without hassle.
You can learn more about how Sonos came to be in our profile of Nick Millington, one of the company's most prolific inventors.
This week, Sonos has put its soundbars and subs on sale, likely to capitalize on the TV deals happening through Super Bowl weekend. The deals will end midnight on Sunday, February 3, after the big game. Regardless of the reason, it's good news if you're looking to buy a soundbar. (If you don't own a soundbar for your TV, you really should. Here are some of our favorites.)
Sonos Stuff on Sale
Buying Tips
Our Sonos Buying Guide also goes more in depth on the strengths and shortcomings of every product mentioned above, but here are a few highlights. The Sonos Sub carries a hefty price tag, but if you can afford it, buy it and stick it next to your couch. It will dramatically improve the immersive qualities of any of the three soundbars.
The Playbar has the best sound of the three, but the Beam isn't far behind and has hands-free Alexa (and soon Google Assistant) built into it. It looks better, has newer tech inside, and sounds outstanding with or without the Sub. We like the Playbase, but high-pitched sounds like cymbals do feel a bit harsh on it. It's also made for a TV with a pedestal stand to sit atop it, and those are out of fashion at the moment. Also, if you need a longer power cable, Sonos now sells them.

Megan Rose Dickey,"San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed wants you to remember that she was once, and will be the future of mayor of San Francisco, she said at the Lesbians Who Tech conference on Friday. For those unfamiliar with San Francisco local politics, Breed temporarily served as acting mayor following the untimely passing of SF Mayor Ed Lee in December. As a result of his passing before the completion of his term, San Francisco is holding a special election in June, in which Breed, Supervisor Jane Kim, former Supervisor Mark Leno and others are running for mayor. In addition to describing what it was like growing up in San Francisco and laying out some of the issues the city faces, like the lack of affordable housing, homelessness, and mental health and substance abuse, Breed called on the tech industry to do better with diversity and inclusion. “San Francisco has a complex, if not ironic relationship with your industry,” Breed said to a crowd of techies. “This is a place where someone can get out of an Uber, and pull out their iPhone and send a tweet about how the tech industry is ruining the city.” While tech has undoubtedly led to job creation in San Francisco, there is still a large number of people who feel left out or have been pushed out of the city, she said. For example, black people make up just 3 percent of employees and Latinx people make up 6 percent of employees at the top ranked 75 Silicon Valley tech firms, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “Your industry is creating world class companies, innovating and designing products the rest of us use every single day,” Breed said. “But we cannot call that work success if LGBT people, if minorities, if women are excluded from it.” Breed says she wants to work with the tech community to ensure diversity and inclusion in the industry while helping create a city where people are not forced to live on the streets. She added, “We also must confront the tragic dichotomy of homeless people suffering right at the feet of multi-billion dollar companies.” Featured Image: TechCrunch/MRD","San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed wants you to remember that she was once, and will be the future of mayor of San Francisco, she said at the Lesbians Who Tech conference on Friday.

JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,"With victory on your side, it always helps a lot, said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, who said he would back Ms. Pelosi for speaker. But he and other more centrist members of the party in the House will insist on changes to ensure they have a voice in legislating and policymaking. Some of the Democratic candidates most outspoken about opposing her speakership lost on Tuesday, such as Richard Ojeda in West Virginia and Dan McCready in North Carolina. But others won, including Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. Mr. Trumps endorsement comes with an edge. Republicans have long cheered Ms. Pelosis continued reign over House Democrats, seeing in her the perfect foil for negative campaign ads to rile conservative voters. Ms. Pelosi again was the star of hundreds of Republican ads that blanketed the country. In recent months, the president, who phoned Ms. Pelosi on Tuesday night to congratulate her on the Democrats victory, singled her out by name and savaged her during his raucous rallies. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday night that he planned to run for majority leader, the No. 2 position in the House, while Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina plans to run for whip, the No. 3 post. That lineup, if endorsed by Democrats, would preserve the top three positions in the partys House caucus as they currently are with none of the youthful sheen of the incoming class.","As Ms. Pelosi moves to line up the votes to resume her speakership of the House, she secured an endorsement from President Trump, who may relish the chance to spar with her over the next two years.",2018-11-07T17:12:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Nancy Pelosi for Speaker?

George Dvorsky,"Using a computer powered by an off-the-shelf Intel Core i5-6600 processor, a FedEx employee from Tennessee has discovered the largest prime number known to humanity. At 23,249,425 digits long, it’s nearly a million digits longer than the previous record holder. For those of you who failed or have long forgotten grade 3 math class, a prime number is any number that can only be divided by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.). It’s a freaky quirk of the Universe that has captivated mathematicians for centuries, as their appearance in the roll call of all integers defies prediction ( though biases have been detected in the distribution of consecutive primes ). Finding prime numbers thus requires a bit of trial-and-error, patience, and a lot of computing power. The new record-holding prime number, dubbed “M77232917,” was discovered by Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, on December 26, 2017. It was discovered as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a group that does exactly what its name implies. Mersenne primes—named after the 17th century French monk Marin Mersenne—are a rare class of primes that are one integer less than a number that’s been multiplied by itself, expressed as M n =2 n -1. In this case, the new prime was calculated by multiplying 77,232,917 by 77,232,917 and then subtracting one (2 77,232,917 -1). The new prime is the 50th known Mersenne prime. M77232917 contains 23,249,425 digits, which is practically impossible for the human brain to comprehend. You can download a zip file of the number here, which busts open into a simple text file nearly 24 MB in size. Here’s an itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny glimpse of the first few digits of the number: 467333183359231099988335585561115521251321102817714495798582338593567923480521177207484311099740208849621368090038049317248367442513519144365249220286787499224923639633038619305951170770522850356011779638644050954128274109548519743273551014325753249976993808191641040774990607027085131780854431482719287927051574760059182501122426493901177524147020112211388180246357120385256971031180861489618892584067750976814954567907442159253928086043451513107052318572800622535173305043931545049276946896285268869674944342112985792233732337801754241421827174125670264416644353313890442672256181107628062641550510992384203991225537857049225867450478199850186985188395719963008038717965906943698446227245769048442624077040456516926390008651726462990593760595429486791654633562139216744557672746497884434353520456556797052450980481438931349795938877105350614496693489409255155953306872814733490045565082856578190868933327141046378794972655266893887595979641316331028806592177529769834152124115913323365268166706644473143310974520823513974885636253719301950406605722095718079173467784212323941225708492276162678848504240175619575042958633387070067162448853074807881260125089824549619209919961134580250514604063519606634978181198613503051581163463555633566319896615827604388690329796011984096270537383579630874681056843649818067678103424096859574594387122476571828072557344394780380024201783548667495179746696190843622986643959450031252516686566594252074345358101581042723707992427571828820948849065861590065859074391377828173034683701925114789618787309101887004289046129873028746416386957443644028588809312429908860884297613860386816910586542216739001402734982971907272987483662107236827512472738409809578930670626153249685719278922751692157130896802807496462527584643633045876649970923366331569812027362273631245871521356011614860439988085178768763757860732625585115457092087848043258257876286498706458088135038948822247351807130888403164645794446319243717913259933477001220994458815795663730102285010141814663265537150923894600650386095599714691658518044760943228485293103850039495787904594766307709643249139518714435912361386106141359015789488893140142052513122486651646114701666701676143140750087224603889234655205528086110973730635187042131130393016253362794058251836128055518549678930658366455272915511811952058888392595313861166137697724678782720586680474567342842176857469092018559835324800004598444782456084485904576297338813661199170205858652099033435737405594286587479579072034591348880491778480562894857788046177321792968258171597503720079791566992083055824866579012557180722751078462924794248439652077467237403658550061799279956704411031254567465451105499362798947781210188466981867175415780089815289984924792655784203471522023573618649847743212240495339397953595778060553510296261735673554034489108685389266344608133903535814448582274184496823988891485433908407138755118440965780608756502239030483891349117815030583034147983474364473410786162232983781676844315610390028354503758000566280031377558992067117024880997033717503400673301922738074511864300037419291160271133918403435581992793701952141372100135595457599485254674121618690682674413645774237169049255424728665357996103997069776243968010876776475830443576635739972027953438424843103674054245431824410173440025375378765370235220916664367509996157398715673180804853549565098667607871303308044944405283848532769455954881164266322865068561846182186079278726212101078949803932341590437977436216839406044542808714268030063768857675412060494935032858614372477002463478278523399030686898768798513296184049579718910789231320899515797161738788846785311885... You get the point. According to GIMP, that’s big enough to fill an entire shelf of books totalling 9,000 pages. Or put another way, “If every second you were to write five digits to an inch then 54 days later you’d have a number stretching over 73 miles (118 km)—almost 3 miles (5 km) longer than the previous record prime,” writes GIMP. Pace, a long-time math enthusiast and a current employee at FedEx, does charity work as a SysAdmin, running Prime95 on all his PCs and servers; Pace is one of thousands of volunteers who are using free GIMPS software in the effort to continually find larger and larger prime numbers. The PC that Pace used to find the prime number required six straight days of computation on a quad-core Intel i5-6600 CPU to verify it. Indeed, the discovery of new primes is no small task; every candidate prime must go through the time-consuming and rigorous process of being cut-up by any potential divisors. Once a candidate prime is discovered, it has to be verified by outside sources. In this case, the prime was independently verified by four different programs running on different hardware configurations: Aaron Blosser verified it using Prime95 on an Intel Xeon server in 37 hours. David Stanfill verified it using gpuOwL on an AMD RX Vega 64 GPU in 34 hours Andreas Höglund verified the prime using CUDALucas running on NVidia Titan Black GPU in 73 hours Ernst Mayer also verified it using his own program Mlucas on 32-core Xeon server in 82 hours. Andreas Höglund also confirmed using Mlucas running on an Amazon AWS instance in 65 hours. The quest to find more prime numbers may seem frivolous, but they hold practical applications as well, such as the generation of public key cryptography algorithms, hash tables, and as random number generators. Further work into primes could also tell us a bit more about mathematics and why it’s so damned good at describing the universe. And as Carl Sagan speculated in Cosmos, transmitting streams of consecutive primes could also be used as a way of saying “hello” to an alien civilization. As exciting as this discovery is, the Holy Grail of primes is yet to be found: a prime number containing 100 million digits. The first person to find this elusive number will be awarded $150,000 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Good luck!

Instead, they briefly introduce a few of the kids — in particular, moody orphan Shuya (played by Tatsuya Fujiwara) and diligent student Noriko (Aki Maeda) — and their former teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), who’s collaborating with this government-approved extermination program as part of an earnest effort to counteract juvenile delinquency. Once the major players are on the field, mayhem ensues, as some youngsters form tenuous alliances, while others try to figure out if there’s a way to subvert the system before their former friends stab, shoot, or poison them. Why watch now? Because The First Purge is playing in theaters this weekend. The fourth film in the popular action-horror franchise is a prequel, set as the New Founding Fathers of America experiment with letting the country’s underclass freely commit crimes — preferably against each other — on one night each year. More uncomfortably close to reality than ever, The First Purge suggests that even seemingly upstanding citizens are all too willing to cede power to cruel authoritarians, so long as the people in charge promise to target ethnic minorities and the poor, for the overall benefit of the middle-class majority. Increasingly, this series has become one long case study in how governing based on fear, discrimination, and violence has unpredictable and often catastrophic results. These have been common themes in science fiction, fantasy, and horror fiction over the decades, for about as long as those genres have existed. Logan’s Run, 1984, Escape from New York, George Romero’s zombie movies, and countless other books and films have depicted a terrified, paranoid humanity, struggling to manage real and perceived threats to their survival by imposing a rigid social order that ultimately makes everything worse. In the wake of the international success of Battle Royale, the young-adult literature market exploded with similar sagas about teens fighting each other to the death, by dictatorial edict. The most popular was The Hunger Games — which was criticized at times for being a sanitized version of Battle Royale. In the Fukasaku film, a cash-strapped Japan has passed the “Millennium Educational Reform Act,” the purpose of which seems to be twofold: to reduce the population of teens about to enter a thin employment market, and to punish those kids for the bad attitudes they’ve developed during a time of national crisis. Battle Royale isn’t as pointed in its social critique as some of the movies, novels, TV series, and comics that have come before or since. But it’s fairly resolute in its opinion that even the most obnoxious of this game’s contestants are being unfairly targeted by insensitive, short-sighted adults. Photo: Toei Company Who it’s for People who enjoy debating situational ethics — and who don’t mind watching a slew of fictional folks get slaughtered in entertaining ways. Battle Royale was controversial when it was originally released, in part because the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School was still fresh in the public memory, and some critics found the idea of turning “kids killing kids” into an over-the-top action-adventure picture appalling, or even dangerous. Unlike later iterations of this premise ( The Hunger Games, for example), Battle Royale isn’t especially somber. Fukasaku employs an almost comically melodramatic Masamichi Amano score, and he and his son have fun with the way teen vanity and social hierarchies persist even after all the students are armed. Perversely, Battle Royale ’s lack of concern with socially responsibility or political cogency is what makes it so effective. Because the Fukasakus don’t seem to care overmuch about making any particular point, they’re freed to tell Takami’s story in a way that’s gripping first and foremost, with twists and surprises that at times have viewers actively rooting for something awful to happen. The film has the power to expose its audience’s own tenuous morality. Where to see it Netflix. For more dystopian mayhem and deadly teens, the service also offers Battle Royale 2 (directed by Kenta Fukasaku, who took over the production after his father died in 2003), Tag (Sion Sono’s 2015 art-horror film about a Japanese high-school girl stumbling through a surreal landscape where her peers keep dying in spectacularly disgusting ways) and 3% (a Brazilian TV series set in a bleak future Earth where impoverished young people are given a yearly opportunity to compete to join the upper class).","In the genre of “exploitation films about the government forcing people to kill each other,” this one’s a classic",2018-07-06T15:45:49Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","With The First Purge in theaters, it’s a good weekend to watch Battle Royale on Netflix",https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540508/the-first-purge-streaming-recommendation-battle-royale-netflix,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cz6sjBMQZabdFTwu_Q2AGSK1JM=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11652013/11096455_679019408909922_8129622812917519401_o.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-3,1
Emily Price,"During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does. At some point during the conversation, it came out that I had never had a true Irish coffee. Seconds later they made sure I had one in my hand and I was hooked. In the United States, an “Irish Coffee” can mean anything from a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey in it to the real deal, but more often than not it falls somewhere in between. A traditional Irish coffee will typically be served in a small glass cup identical to the one in the photo above. It’s most often made with Jameson and sweetened coffee, and topped with chilled double cream (liquid cream, not whipped cream from a can) which can be tricky to get just right. I spent the past week in Ireland and my Irish Coffee dojo Martin demoed how to make the magic happen at one of the bars we stopped in at. You can check out my video of the demo below: Video: E.Price Given that I shot it in a crowded bar in not the most ideal way, I’ve also included a demo from Jameson proper which is a little different than what Martin showed me but is a little different. My written directions below are what I was taught and I think lead to a more authentic and tastier coffee, but you do you and adjust as needed. How to do it You want to start by warming your class up by pouring in hot water. If you’re using one of those fancy coffee glasses like I have above, you want to put a spoon inside the cup when you do this so you don’t break it. After you dump the water, fill the glass roughly 2/3 of the way full of coffee and then add some sugar. Jameson says to use 2 parts Demerara sugar and 1 part Muscovado sugar, Martin just used three spoonfuls of brown sugar. Yes, it’s a lot of sugar, but you need that amount not only to get the flavor right but also to ensure that your cream will float. Once you add the sugar give it a serious stir and make sure all of it dissolves, then add your whiskey. For a glass the size above, I used a shot of whiskey and a little extra for “good luck.” If you’re using a larger glass, by all means use more whiskey. Give the coffee another stir and then you’re ready for your cream. This was the most interesting detail for me. At home when I’ve tried to do this before I pour the cream in and it sinks to the bottom. Not what you want. That can happen when you don’t have enough sugar, but it’s also an issue if you screw up the pouring. For that, you want to rest your spoon right on the top of the coffee in your glass, so close that the bottom of the spoon is getting wet, but there isn’t any coffee inside the spoon. Then you slowly pour the cream into the spoon, allowing it to disperse across the top of your drink. The Jameson video above spoons a heavier cream over the top which also works, but doesn’t look as good in my opinion. If you want to go suuuuper easy you can also use canned whipped cream, but that’s pretty far from authentic and definitely not as tasty. If you have your spoon in the wrong spot, which is easy to do, then you just end up with cream throughout your glass. It’s still delicious, but definitely not as pretty. If you’re looking for a delicious treat this St. Patrick’s Day I definitely recommend giving an Irish coffee a try. You’ll thank me later.","During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does.

MICHAEL J. de la MERCED,"That has meant parting with divisions that are performing well. The biopharmaceutical business accounted for about $3 billion of the $20 billion in revenue that G.E.s health care unit generated last year.

Brian Pascus,"In an effort to increase customer comfort and get a leg up on the competition, Delta Air Lines recently renovated all of the seats within its fleet of Boeing 777-200s. On Monday, Delta announced a ""full fleet interior renovation"" that has made the width of its economy class seats 18.5 inches. For comparison, American Airlines and United Airlines seats are 17 inches wide. ""The upgraded 777 design is part of Delta's multi-billion dollar investment in the overall customer experience,"" the airline said in a statement on its media website. The biggest change for travelers is in economy class (known as Main Cabin extra). Fliers in those seats now have more room to spread their legs. Previously, Delta used an industry standard 3-3-3 seat arrangement for economy class — that being three seats at the left window, four in the middle, three at the right window. Delta's new Main Cconfigurationation will feature nine seats across — three in each section, nine total — rather than the standard 10 across issued by American Airlines and United Airlines. ""The comfort of our customers—across all cabins—is a top priority,"" Delta spokesperson, Savannah Huddleston, said in a statement to Business Insider on Thursday. ""That's why we've committed to remain at 9-abreast seating in the Main Cabin as we modify our 777s, versus the new norm of 10 across. With 9-abreat, we're able to offer wider Main Cabin seats - the widest of our international fleet - and more preferable seat options."" The wider seats come with a personal power outlet for passengers and an 11-inch TV screen for them to watch movies or shows. This sounds pretty impressive, especially when considering earlier this year American Airlines announced it will be eliminating screens on the back of seats in its 737s. Another cool improvement is Delta's premium economy section, called Premium Select. This smaller section of the plane has only eight seats across (structured in a 2-4-2 format) to ensure greater legroom and more space for passengers to move around the cabin. Finally, Delta's first class cabin (known as ""Delta One Suites""), now has sliding door accesses to a private cove filled with entertainment options, a personal table, and a 24-inch wide reclining seat. According to Forbes, the newly renovated Delta 777-200 will have 296 total seats: 220 seats in Main Cabin, 48 in Premium Select, and a precious 28 in Delta One Suites.

Jeffrey Van Camp,"Samsung's 2019 class of Galaxy smartphones have landed. Class is an appropriate way to put it, too. The phone maker announced four versions of its Galaxy S10 on Wednesday, and topped it off with the Galaxy Fold, its brand new bendy phone. They all look amazing, with edge-to-edge-to-edge-to-edge screens, a small beauty mark for their selfie cameras, neat new photography tricks, in-display fingerprint sensors, and other perks, like the ability to wirelessly charge other devices you lay on top of them. They may be the best Samsung phones ever; they're also the most expensive.
Following Apple's iPhone price hikes, Samsung's Galaxy phones continue to rocket upward in price with the S10 line. The flat-faced Galaxy S10e (that's ""e"" for ""economy"") is now $750, and it only gets worse from there. The standard Galaxy S10 starts at $900 and comes with a new triple rear camera, more RAM, and a slightly larger battery. Its larger sibling, the Galaxy S10 Plus starts at $1,000 with an even larger battery and a dual-selfie cam spot built into its screen. (You can preorder the Galaxy S10 now. We recommend the Unlocked version.)
We don't actually know the price of the Galaxy S10 5G, but it's a safe bet it will exceed $1,000. It has four rear cameras and is one of the first phones that will be able to connect to 5G networks... whenever those finally become a reality. (Maybe next year?) The unique Galaxy Fold is also quite amazing, but starts atbrace yourself$1,980.
There's no doubt that the Galaxy S10 phones are technical marvels, but does having a smartphone with the most screen really matter all that much anymore? If you just want a really nice phone that works well and doesn't decimate your budget, here are a few older Samsung phones you should consider, and some Galaxy alternatives.
Samsung Galaxy S9 ($420+)
Galaxy S9
The Galaxy S9 is about a year old now, but it's still just about as fast as phones come outside of the shiny new S10. It's also several hundred dollars cheaper. The S9 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a camera that can snap with the best of them and some perks you don't see on every modern phone, like a headphone jack and MicroSD slot. It has a fingerprint sensor on its back, not a fancy new in-display fingerprint sensor, but that's hardly a dealbreaker. The camera on the standard model is also single-lens, not triple lens, so it's lacking the wide-angle and zoom-like features on the new S10s. Oh, and there is a top and bottom bezel on the phone instead of a camera dimple on the screen.
The good news: Samsung has updated the S9 to Android Pie, the latest version of Android, and even given its interface a bit of a makeover. Samsung is slow with updates, but there's a strong chance this phone will get feature updates for another year or two. It also comes unlocked, which means it will work on any wireless network.

Galaxy S9 Plus Pricing (Varies by network):
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 ($700+)
Galaxy Note 9
Think of the Note 9 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) as a bedazzled version of the S9. It has many of the same strengths and weaknessesbut it's bigger, has more RAM, better battery life, and file storage under the hood. Like all Galaxy Notes, it has an S-Pen stylus that pops out the bottom so you can write or draw directly on the screen. It's more useful than ever, and isn't something you'll get in any other new phone, until the Note 10 inevitably hits shelves this coming August or September.
Whether you buy a Note 9 should come down to your size preferences and your feelings toward styli.

Avoid the Galaxy S8 and Note 8
There's nothing wrong with buying a two-year-old phone, like the Galaxy S8 or Note 8. We just don't think you should. Samsung has a spotty history of supporting phones with software updates after two years, and the S8 has a few annoying qualities. The fingerprint sensor is right next to the rear camera, and almost indistinguishable by touch. I never stopped accidentally smudging my camera lens while trying to unlock my S8. It's a problem that sounds silly, but will infuriate you at times. Battery life was also a tad worse on these phones than their successors.
The Note 8 also has a poorly placed fingerprint sensor and may not get software support for too much longer. Both phones have fabulous cameras, but there have been some noticeable improvements in the last year or two.

Samsung makes marvelous Android phones, but they aren't the only phones worth buying right now. Our favorite Android phone right now is the Google Pixel 3, and there are a few others you may want to check out, too.

Google Pixel 3 ($750+) is Outstanding: The Pixel 3 hit shelves in late 2018, and is still one of the fastest, best phones you can own. The camera is a highlight thanks to a new feature called Night Sight that does exactly what you'd think. It's also one of the only high-end phones that gets software and security updates immediately, directly from Google. I linked to B&amp;H because it has the best price right now, but you can also get it directly from Google for $799. It runs on all four major wireless networks.
OnePlus 6T ($579) Also Has an In-Display Fingerprint Sensor: It's not flawless, but the OnePlus 6T is a very powerful phone at a cheaper price. It gets speedy updates and an innovative in-display sensor. I don't yet know if it's as fast or secure as Samsung's, but it does work and is more convenient than some fingerprint sensors due to its location. It works on AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizonbasically, anywhere but Sprint. You can also buy it directly from T-Mobile.
LG G7 ($430+) is Powerful and Great for Audio: The G7 also has an audio jack, powerful processor, and is one of the best phones for high-quality audio. It should work on every major wireless network. Read our full review here. It's also available for $480 - $627 from Amazon and $500 - $600 from Best Buy.

Steve Dent,"Another key feature is in-body, 5-axis stabilization, the first in an X Series model. The X-1H has three axial gyros and a dual-processor that can do 10,000 calculations per second, giving you up to to 5.5 stops of shake reduction, depending on the lens. To further reduce vibration, it has a new leaf-spring shutter-release switch and electronic shutter that Fujifilm calls ""near-silent."" The X-H1 packs an all-new OLED EVF with 0.75x magnification and 3.69 million dot resolution, ""leading the class for APS-C mirrorless cameras,"" Fujifilm said. It has display lag of 0.005 seconds and refreshes at 100 fps -- specs that jibe closely with the EVF on Sony's A7R III, you might notice. The 3-inch display has a 1.04 million dot touch panel that can be tilted in three directions, but Fujifilm didn't say if it can be flipped around for vloggers or selfies. The sub-LCD on top is 1.28 inches wide. With the X-H1, Fujifilm is finally making a serious bid to attract videographers. You can shoot 4,096 x 2,160 DCI, 24fps video, 3,840 x 2,160 at 30p and 1080p at 120fps, with a maximum bit rate of 200 Mbps. That's quite good, but Panasonic's GH5 and GH5s can handle 4K at up to 60 fps, with a 400 Mbps maximum bit rate. Fujifilm didn't say whether the X-H1 can output 10-bit video, which reduces banding and makes color grading easier. Fujifilm also added a 1080p, 120fps mode, F-log SD card recording to smooth workflow, a 12-stop dynamic range setting and a new ""high-sound quality internal microphone"" -- a plus, since the internal mic on the X-T2 is... not good. Lastly, it's offering ""Eterna,"" a film simulation mode ""that is ideal for shooting movies."" If you're wondering if the X-H1 has both microphone and headphone inputs, the answer seems to be ""sort of."" Like the X-T2, there is a microphone input, but if you want a headphone jack, you'll have to pay an extra $300 to get the ""Vertical Power Booster Grip Kit."" As a plus, you do get 30 minutes of extra 4K shooting time and faster burst speeds with that accessory. Other key features include a new ""flicker reduction mode,"" that eliminates strobing and banding under fluorescent and mercury lighting, and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless capability (no sign of WiFi or NFC, though). Fujifilm also unveiled a pair of cinema zoom lenses that match up with the X-H1's new video talents, the Fujinon MKX18-55mm T2.9 and MKX50-135mm T2.9 (T2.9 means F/2.9). Those will run (wait for it) $4,000 and $4,300, respectively. Yes, cinema lenses are always expensive.

NELLIE BOWLES,"Every morning is dance awake, a chakra meditation and guitar class where Esalen guests dance across the large hardwood floor. Down in the kitchen, Mr. Kallayil’s assistant collected a large bag of raisins for eating during meditation. “I just sold my start-up and needed a place to reflect,” said Sam McBride, 31, from Chicago. “To give me some perspective.” Esalen’s hot springs are good all day but are famous for the night scene, when they open to the public between 1 and 3 a.m. A weekend stay for a couple at Esalen can cost $2,890, so budget travelers stay nearby and come wandering in with towels a little after midnight. The dirt path to the baths leads to a concrete corridor and a changing room. Around a corner, it was pitch black with an overpowering smell of sulfur. As the eyes adjusted to starlight, big steaming concrete hot tubs, claw-foot personal tubs and a couple of dozen quiet naked bodies could be seen. The space cannot be photographed. “I was tired of my life,” said Marina Kurikhina, 32, who lives on a ranch nearby. “I represented Latin American art at a gallery in London. Now I teach creative subconscious painting.” She said people visited Esalen “for transformation.” Soon, she plans to open a health bar on site serving raw desserts, cold-pressed juices and high-end coffee. Photo Esalen also holds art classes at the art barn. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times Photo Cortlan Robertson had intentions of his children attending Esalen’s Gazebo preschool program before it was recently canceled. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times With the focus on the emotional life of executives, Esalen plans to close Gazebo, its preschool of 40 years. “It was the soul of the institution of Esalen — all those little babies and what they’re going to be,” said Zoe Garcia, a guest and nearby resident, who has been going to Esalen for 30 years. The closing is partly a sign of the region’s changing demographics. As more of Big Sur’s homes are bought by tech executives as second homes, there are not as many young children, so the class of 30 had dwindled to 15 before the floods shut it down. “It’s incredibly sad,” said Cortlan Robertson, whose daughter attended Gazebo and who said the Big Sur community had offered to pay for the preschool to continue. “Ben is always saying it’s just child care. But it was so much more.” Closing Gazebo was also a sign of a shifting culture and new rules. “Back then, we could go topless in the lodge,” Ms. Garcia said. “More conservative people started to come, so they started to make rules. Now next is mindfulness and technology. Who knows?” Mr. Tauber was a surprising pick to head a retreat center. He had previously founded a real - time celebrity geo-stalking service called JustSpotted when Google hired him and his team in 2011. Soon after, he vacationed in Big Sur and decided his work was causing harm, he said. “I realized I was addicting people to their phones,” Mr. Tauber said. “It’s a crisis that everyone’s in the culture of killing it, and inside they’re dying.” In the hot spring one night, he ran into an Esalen leader who invited him to a conscious business event. Mr. Tauber quit Google to open a business coaching start-up founders and developed Esalen’s technology strategy, joining the board in 2015. During the springtime flooding, as Esalen cut its staff to 50 from 330, Mr. Tauber took over. His plan is to aim programming at top executives. “How do we scale our impact as an organization?” he asked. “We do it through impacting the influencers.” His house is a wood-and-stone half circle built into the hillside, looking out through the cypress onto the water. He wanted a better view so had the cypress pruned. He has a ukulele, a prayer bowl and various massage tools by the sofa. By the dying embers of a fire that he makes every morning, he was reading a history of Esalen and a Summer of Love coffee table book. Upstairs, the Inner-Net class was doing a compassion exercise. Everyone spent 10 minutes looking into a stranger’s eyes and silently repeating phrases like “this person has emotions just like me,” “this person has experienced pain and suffering just like me,” “this person will die just like me.” They were barefoot. Some were wrapped in coarse blankets. The art teacher downstairs had made a trough of warm, foaming mushroom drink.

TEA, NEWS AND PREP When I wake up at 7, the city is quiet. You almost feel like the only one up, and I like that feeling. I am not a breakfast person, so Ill have a cup of tea and catch up on news, engage with the social media community; Ill go over my Nets scripts to prepare for games that week.

GET PUMPED I go to the 9:30 service at Redeemer Downtown on 14th Street, and I love hearing the sermon. It grounds me, reminds me how great God has been to me, my family and friends, and I leave more knowledgeable. Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer in Manhattan, is a well-known author, so I knew I wanted to check out his teaching when I came to New York. I found Redeemer and fell in love with the Bible-based teaching. Thats a priority to me. We can all preach on feelings, but teaching on truth is what I live for, and learn from.

SPIRIT AND BODY Right after church, I walk to 23rd Street and teach a 12:45 class at Peloton. Its a live class that is broadcast to all bikes and app members. Its literally my Feel Good Ride the name of the class as it allows me to bridge the gap of how great I feel from church and being on the bike, working out with thousands of riders at the same time, inspiring them through uplifting and encouraging language. I love Peloton because of its community. Its not only the leader in the hybrid of technology and fitness, but we are able to build social relationships that are magnified both on the bike, which uses a leader board that syncs with other riders, and off the bike, through real friendships across the country.
A LITTLE BUSINESS Ill get off my bike around 1:30 and meet with Faye Farrales, who helps me run Love Squad. Its really informal on Sundays, but were a small business, so its important to work in those off-peak hours and get ahead of the game so we know what were doing and build a strategy for the upcoming week.

Theres usually a wait, so we have some drinks at the bar before sitting down. And it really depends on how much fun were having, but brunch can end anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30. When its over, Ill go home to change and meet my boyfriend, Andrew.

THE BOYFRIEND Andrew and I see each other every day. I start my mornings with him, and sometimes on Sundays he joins for church, and he often comes to class, as well, but we always meet up for comedy and dinner. At 8 we go to the stand-up show at the Village Underground on Third Street. We love to laugh, so comedy is perfect we thoroughly enjoy and respect those who can get up, live, and make people laugh. Making people laugh on the spot is real talent. Anyone can tell one good joke, but very few people can thread jokes together to tell a story, be impactful, and just make it super funny. My favorite comics include Hasan Minhaj, Stephen Colbert, Kevin James. After the show, we always go around the corner to Mint Masala on Macdougal Street for amazing Indian food. We love the curry chicken and lamb rogan josh.

"Ralph Ellis, CNN","(CNN)The Oakland Unified School District and striking teachers have come to an agreement after a seven-day strike, the district and the teachers' union, the Oakland Education Association, said Friday.
The contract won't be official unless union members ratify it in the next 24 hours, but the OEA sounded optimistic, with a news release calling it ""a historic contract with a win in every major proposal we made. ...""
The California school district issued its own news release hailing the pact.
""We cannot fix decades of chronic underinvestment in education with a single contract, but this is an important first step,"" Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammel said in the release.
The district said it barely has enough money to take care of its low-income students -- 75% qualify for free or reduced lunch. 
In the news release, the school district says the new contract ""provides a total compensation increase of 14% - an 11% on-going salary increase with a one-time 3% bonus for educators. It also reduces class sizes and maintains the fiscal solvency of the school district.""
The union's news release said the four-year contract will also bring a five-month pause in school closures, lower caseloads for special education teachers and a cap on charter schools.
The school district serves 37,000 students.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,"Trump has no answer for that. He doesn’t believe the climate science that NASA is telling him is true. He is trying to bring back coal precisely when wind, solar and efficiency are becoming cheaper, cleaner, healthier alternatives — precisely when four of the five biggest wind states are red states and precisely when China has committed itself to owning the clean power and electric car markets of the future! He’s trying to force the U.S. auto industry to bring back gas guzzlers when the last time we did that — from the 1980s to the 2000s — Japan and Korea bankrupted Detroit and we enriched petro-dictators from Venezuela to Russia to the Arab world to Iran. Trump is the president who’s throwing away our umbrella right before the storm. Sure, Trump will sneer that “green” is girlyman, uneconomic, unpatriotic and vaguely French. But Democrats can easily counter that green is globally strategic, locally profitable and working class — green is the new red, white and blue. That message can play today in Rust Belt battleground states like Michigan and Ohio. One recent clean energy industry study found that 714,257 people in 12 Midwestern states work in renewable energy generation, clean transmission, energy efficiency, clean fuels and advanced transportation. Some 108,000 in Ohio alone do, compared with 38,000 in the coal, oil and gas fields. The Democratic message could start with some simple math: There are currently 7.6 billion people on the planet, and in 2030 there will be 8.6 billion — another one billion in just over a decade! If even half of them get cars, have air-conditioners and eat high-protein diets like Americans now do, we will devour and burn up the planet beyond recognition. So what does that mean? It means clean energy and efficiency have to be the next great global industry or we’re going to be a bad biological experiment, whether there is climate change or not. Does anyone — other than Trump — believe that America can continue to dominate the world economy and not lead the next great global industry, but leave that to China? The Democratic strategy should be built around putting together the performance standards, research and carbon pricing to achieve what Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey calls “the four zeros.” These are, Harvey explains: 1. “A zero-carbon grid. Right now, Republican states like Texas and Wyoming dominate the U.S. wind industry and are reaping most of the jobs and environmental benefits. That should go national. 2. Zero-emission vehicles. When you combine a zero-carbon grid with electric vehicles, bingo, you have zero-carbon transportation. 3. Zero-net energy buildings. What if you could build a well-insulated home, put today’s inexpensive solar panels on the roof and, over the course of a year, produce as much energy as you consume? Fantastical? No. It’s now the law in Santa Monica, and getting most of the way there is already feasible — and cost-effective — throughout the country. 4. Zero-waste manufacturing. New techniques in manufacturing, such as 3-D printing or advanced chemistry, can slash waste — and waste is a tax on both the budget and the earth.” Now that’s a platform worth running on, and it’s one that can do what Democrats need most: make them the party of strengthening the working class and American security. Clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing and efficient buildings make everything we want to achieve in our society easier. They can lower our health care costs, lower heating bills for the poor, drive 21st-century innovation, foster decent jobs, mitigate climate change, create more competitive export industries, weaken petro-dictators — and enhance U.S. national security and moral leadership.

Reuters,"Tesla's Model 3 sedan recorded more registrations in California than its class rivals BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class in the first quarter, according to a report by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA). Model 3 registrations totaled 3,723, or 14.3 percent of the near-luxury segment, compared with 3,323 for the Mercedes variant and 3,260 for the BMW model, the CNCDA report said. Tesla started delivering the Model 3 to customers in December 2017. California is a key market for global luxury vehicle brands not just because of its size, but because other markets often follow trends set by wealthy consumers in the state.

SHERYL GAY STOLBERG,"I wish he wouldnt tweet as much, Mr. Thune told reporters, adding, Thats obviously a very sensitive part of our states history. So yeah, I wish hed stay away from it.
But generally, elected Republicans have let the president slide.
They know on some level that their defense of Trump is morally unsupportable, and so when they get a chance to speak out against Steve King, who doesnt have any power over them and doesnt pose a threat to them, a lot of them are falling over themselves to condemn him, said Peter Wehner, who advised President George W. Bush on domestic policy. But you cant condemn Steve King and not condemn Donald Trump and pretend that youre doing the right moral and ethical thing.
In Mr. King, Republicans seem happy to have found an opportunity to condemn racism without attacking the president. After taking a beating in the 2018 midterm elections which produced a freshman Republican class that is almost entirely white and male and boosted the share of white men in the House Republican Conference to 90 percent Republicans are also well aware that the party needs to overhaul its image.
But Mr. Trumps critics within the party say that no overhaul can be complete without denouncing the president.
Michael Gerson, who was the top speechwriter for Mr. Bush, published an opinion article in The Washington Post this week that carried the headline, Republicans Need to Condemn Trumps Brazen Bigotry.
Mr. Wehner agreed: Its a massive inconsistency and a sign of cowardice and intimidation on the part of Republicans and I think also a sign of a guilty conscience.
After Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said Tuesday on television that Mr. Kings comments were absolutely abhorrent and racist, Mr. Wehner took to Twitter: I wonder if Liz Cheney would say the same thing about Donald Trump? he wrote.","Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, last month in Washington.

NEIL IRWIN and EMILY BADGER,"Although some of the areas with declining demographics are hostile to immigration, others, cities as varied as Baltimore, Indianapolis and Fargo, N.D., have embraced the strategy of encouraging it.
One of the key solutions is to welcome immigrants into these communities, said Brooks Rainwater, director of the National League of Cities Center for City Solutions.
Many parts of the country that are growing in population and that are more economically dynamic have depended on the arrival of immigrants for that success.
Sun Belt metros like Dallas and Phoenix have been built on the logic of rapid expansion of quickly built homes, of poached employers, of new highways paved to ever-newer subdivisions. Their economic development strategy is growth. Their chief input is people the more, the better.
Growth cities need immigrants to continue their growth, said Joel Kotkin, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Opportunity Urbanism, which promotes policies to help cities grow. The older historically declining cities need immigrants to reinvigorate their economies. And the expensive cities need them because, frankly, white people, African-Americans and middle-class people are leaving for more affordable areas.
As many industrial cities have lost population since the mid-20th century, Americans have built whole new metropolises on land that was virtually empty then. The Las Vegas metropolitan area, with more than two million people today, had barely 50,000 in 1950. 
Still, only about 3 percent of the countrys land is urbanized.
Americas metropolitan areas remain among the least dense in the world, said Sonia Hirt, a professor of landscape architecture and planning at the University of Georgia. Nationwide, the United States has less than one-third of the population density of the European Union, and a quarter of the density of China.","A road less traveled in Rutland, Vt., last spring.

Matt Novak,"The U.S. Air Force has released the first images of its latest combat drone, the XQ-58A Valkyrie. The new aircraft, which went from concept to first test flight in 2.5 years, behaved as expected on its first test flight this week, according to the Air Force.
The 76-minute inaugural flight occurred on March 5, 2019 at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona. The Air Force released a short 15-second video of the first flight to show it off, something that the military doesnt do with all of its aircraft.
The drone was developed for the Air Force Research Laboratorys (AFRL) Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program which seeks to develop new planes for the military both quickly and inexpensively. 
XQ-58A is the first example of a class of UAV that is defined by low procurement and operating costs while providing game changing combat capability, Doug Szczublewski, AFRLs XQ-58A Program Manager, said in a statement.
The XQ-58A drone reportedly has a range of well over 2,000 miles and can carry both precision-guided bombs and surveillance equipment.
As Tyler Rogoway at The Drive notes, the new drone is specially suited to operate at the direction of manned planes nearby under a concept the Air Force calls its loyal wingman program. Theoretically, a piloted fighter jet could travel alongside a number of these unpiloted Valkyries, which would assist by doing everything from jamming enemy radar to firing on a target.
Rogoway also notes that the finished drone looks remarkably like the earliest concept renderings that were released by its developer, the San Diego-based military contractor Kratos Defense. Kratos is on the forefront of the latest weapons technologies, having recently developed the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System system for the U.S. Navy. Laser weapons, which fall into the category of directed-energy weapons, are being shown off by Americas New Cold War adversary Russia with increased frequency.
The cost of the XQ-58A Valkyrie program wasnt released publicly, but the best estimates put the budget at roughly $2-3 million per plane.

Apple buys Shazam According to that act, there are two separate copyrights for every recorded song: one for the sound recording and one for the musical composition (the song's words and musical notation). Wixen says Spotify ""took a shortcut"" when it struck deals with major labels to get the necessary rights to the songs' sound recordings, but then failed to obtain the equivalent rights for compositions. Spotify, which is based in Sweden, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday outside of regular business hours. Related: Taylor Swift's 'Reputation' sells a million copies in four days The lawsuit is just the latest copyright headache for the music-streaming service. In May, Spotify settled a class action lawsuit with a group of songwriters for $43 million. The songwriters had accused Spotify of using their songs without a license and without paying royalties. Wixen handles copyright management and royalty compliance for artists including Tom Petty. Spotify is currently facing three other lawsuits in Tennessee that were filed by songwriters and music publishers. In those cases, Spotify is also being accused of using songs without paying royalties to publishers and songwriters. Spotify is reportedly valued at $19 billion.

1. Pinterest sets IPO range at $15-17, valuing it at $10.6B vs previous valuation of $12.3B
Social media platform Pinterest filed an updated S-1, where it set the price range at $15-17 per share, which would value the company between $10 billion and $11.3 billion.
That’s a tough (or, you might argue, conservative) picture, valuing the company at around $2 billion less than its valuation as a private startup when it last raised funding in 2017.
2. To stop copycats, Snapchat shares itself
Evan Spiegel has finally found a way to fight back against Mark Zuckerbergs army of clones. His plan is to let other apps embed the best parts of Snapchat, rather than building their own half-rate copies.
3. Grab plans to raise $2B more this year to fund an acquisition spree in Southeast Asia
Fresh from closing a near-$1.5 billion raise from SoftBanks Vision Fund as part of a huge, multi-billion Series H deal, Grab said today that it plans to extend the round to $6.5 billion to amp up its battle with Go-Jek.

Ana Luisa Suarez,"Have you ever flown first class? You get to the airport early and pray to see your name up on the board, on that list of ""next in line for upgrades"" and hope you're in the top 5 slot. Because who has the money to actually pay for first class? No one wants to spend $1,000 (plus) to fly for 3 hours. When airline tickets are already so expensive, the last thing you want to do is spend extra money just to see at the front of the plane. Sure, first class has more legroom, always has a TV (when some economy seats do not), and gets the better drink and dining service. But is it really all that worth it? The answer is ""yes"" to some, but probably ""no"" to many. If you're going to spend the extra cash, it is probably on economy plus, right? Well, now you can splurge and it won't kill your wallet. AURA is a luxury private airline club that is offering first class tickets at an incredibly low price. Honestly, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not fly with this airline. AURA isn't flying just yet, but in 2019 flights across the globe will be taking place. You can sign up for their Founding Keyholder plan by paying a one time fee (currently on sale for $100, instead of $250). That includes fixed fares, a waived keyholder fee, a reduced monthly payment, discounts with partners, and more. AURA is a deliberate effort to create a beautiful flying experience. No aircraft on the market today was designed for what we set out to accomplish, so we had to go design one ourselves. ZED Aerospace crafted AURA to be the most advanced fleet in the sky, unveiling the most modern technologies never before seen on aircraft. AURA isn't about cutting corners or shaving costs, it's about delivering an experience worthy of Five Stars. Some first class fares are under $300 already – a flight from Atlanta to Chicago is $280, while a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles is $580, and a flight from NYC to Miami is $380. And these are all private airline fares! There are only going to be 29 seats aboard the plane and they're broken into two flight classes, First and Wave. Don't let the First name fool you, that actually isn't the first class option, Wave is. Each seat will offer at least 44 inches of room (which is inches over other airlines first class options, which are between 36 and 42""). The premium Wave seating even has chairs that can lay completely flat. The flights comes with complimentary WiFi and iPad pro at every seat. You can look into signing up to be a member at AURA here !

ELIZA SHAPIRO,"Brad Lander, the City Councilman who represents Park Slope and a former M.S. 51 parent, is one of the most vocal integration advocates on the Council, making him an effective booster of the plan. The neighborhood’s role as an epicenter of the test refusal movement has made it an obvious place to experiment with scrapping screened admissions. “I don’t believe that any 10-year-old should have to go through a fourth grade year where they are feeling pressure for grades or pressure to never be late,” said Liz Phillips, the principal of Public School 321 in Park Slope, a high-performing elementary school. “We had kids coming to school sick because they were scared that an absence would impact their ability to get into certain schools,” she said. Michael Perlberg, the principal of Middle School 839 in Kensington, which opened in 2015 as the only non-screened middle school in the district, said his first graduating class is headed to some of the city’s top high schools. “They created beautiful work, their writing and mathematics skills kept pace,” he said. “We see it, it actually happened.” And while the plan to change middle school admissions in Manhattan’s District 3 was met with some vocal opposition, there has been little public resistance to the District 15 plan. Mr. Lander said his office has received only a few dozen emails about the proposal, most of them supportive, and a representative for WXY said the firm had received very little private pushback. Neal Zephyrin, a member of a working group of parents, educators, students and Department of Education officials, said he was confident that “there are more people in favor of this plan than those opposed.” Some Red Hook and Sunset Park residents have raised questions about the plan’s potential to exacerbate gentrification and whether their children would be welcome in mostly white schools. Naila Rosario, who sends her children to Sunset Park schools, said a few of her neighbors told her they don’t believe their schools needed more white students to improve. “They say, ‘my school is already diverse, we have Ecuadorians, Puerto Ricans, Chinese students,’” she said.","The plan for District 15 — which includes Park Slope, Sunset Park and Red Hook — would scrap the screened admissions process for middle school students and replace it with a lottery.",2018-08-23T20:13:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","De Blasio Is Stalled on School Integration, but Brooklyn Parents Have a Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/nyregion/brooklyn-district-15-schools-diversity-lottery.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/nyregion/24DISTRICT/00DISTRICT-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1

Zack Whittaker,"Some of the most sensitive U.S. government departments and agencies still aren’t using a basic email security feature that would significantly cut down on incoming spam or phishing emails. Fifteen percent of all U.S. government domains still aren’t employing DMARC, or domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance policy on their domains, which email systems use to verify the identity that the sender of an email is not an impersonator. New data from security firm Agari shows that out of over a thousand federal domains, 75 percent have a DMARC policy that either monitors, quarantines to your spam folder or entirely rejects all spoofed emails. But the CIA, the NSA, and the Department of Defense are among the outliers still haven’t rolled out DMARC across their web domains. That’s despite Tuesday’s deadline for BOD 18-01, a directive issued by Homeland Security that ordered the rollout of DMARC a year ago, following complaints by a leading Democratic senator. BOD 18-01 aimed to improve email and cybersecurity across the federal government by introducing email encryption (STARTTLS) and doubling down on use of HTTPS certificates across the government. By cranking up the DMARC settings to its safest by outright rejecting unverified email, government departments would comply with the directive by bouncing any unauthenticated email from user inboxes. That may not sound too important, but it means that now that a sizable portion of the federal government and intelligence agencies aren’t protected against an easy class of impersonated emails. According to Agari’s breakdown: CIA has 9 out of 10 domains without a DMARC record; Neither of the NSA’s two domains have DMARC records; The White House’s Executive Office of the President has half of its domains lacking a DMARC record’ The Director of National Intelligence, which co-ordinates the entire U.S. intelligence apparatus, also has all 17 domains without a DMARC record; Defense Dept. has 32 out of 35 domains without a DMARC record; And even Homeland Security, which instituted the policy, has 3 out of 33 domains without a DMARC record. And those are the worst contenders. Only a handful of departments are fully compliant. Proofpoint, which issued similar research Monday with approximately the same data said that it estimates about 60 percent of the federal government are fully compliant with the directive. The government isn’t the only outlier. Only one-third of the Fortune 500 are said to use DMARC on their domains.",Some of the most sensitive U.S. government departments and agencies still aren’t using a basic email security feature that would significantly cut down on incoming spam or phishing emails.

Matthew Lynley,"While coding bootcamps may be in the middle of a shakeout, technology companies around the world are still going to be struggling to fill slots with people equipped with the skills to tackle real-world problems right from the get-go — and Dan Sommer hopes the answer is through universities. That’s the premise behind Trilogy Education, which today said it is raising another $50 million round after raising $30 million last year. This round is led by Highland Capital Partners, with participation from new investorsDan Sommer and Macquarie Group. The company works with around 35 universities to identify skills gaps that they can fill with programs — such as through continuing education — that can get students ready to work at a variety of technology companies right away. Throughout all this, the startup works to collect data and feedback on each course and tune it as workforce needs change over time. “The mission of these institutions through these programs is to open access to new types of learning,” Sommer said. “The average age of the student that takes one of these programs is approximately 32. We have students in classes that are 19 and some that are 76. I f you zoom out and you think about the transformation that’s happening overall in the workforce, and you think about the number of open positions in the areas, that’s where we focused. I believe universities are the place where individuals should go to learn new skills.” All this is increasingly relevant as tasks that machine learning-driven tools can tackle — such as autonomous driving — may end up displacing millions of jobs and requiring those individuals to learn a new set of skills in order to find some new employment. Companies are internally recognizing that in some ways, such as through tools like Degreed, which look to help employers identify those same skills gaps and find ways to train their own employees to fulfill those more complex knowledge worker roles. Degreed raised $42 million earlier this year, and there are still other programs like MissionU ( which raised $8.5 million late last year ) looking to rethink education as the tech economy booms. Still, there has indeed been a shakeout in the coding bootcamp world. Whether a product of just not keeping up with workforce demands or struggling business models, there have been several that have shut down. Galvanize in August last year said it would lay off around 11% of its staff, while Dev Bootcamp and Iron Yard shut down altogether. And for some employers, all it takes is a few bad interviews from one of those bootcamps to lay down a layer of pessimism across the board, depending on who you talk to out here in the Valley. That may be why Trilogy Education is partnering directly with universities. By doing that and running the programs through those universities, it can piggyback on the substantial brand equity they’ve built up over time. Trilogy Education says it gathers feedback from each class — either through surveys or other data points — and uses that to provide its university partners with robust reports on ways to tune the model and what specific roles to go after for potential programs. Trilogy Education works with programs in UI/UX, data analytics and visualization, cybersecurity and web development. The curriculum itself is developed centrally in Github. The goal here is to ensure that the programs are future-proofed and to “teach students how to learn,” Sommer said. That software extends to the programs’ connections with students as well. Trilogy Education helps track student performance, helping universities identify which students might be falling behind and need additional tutoring. For students that are outperforming, it helps connect them with the resources to progress even faster and potentially begin teaching some elements themselves as a way to acquire additional soft skills in addition to the core program. “The sincerest sign of learning is when a student that has learned Angular in class all of the sudden builds a portfolio project in React,” he said. “We’re focused on teaching people how to learn more so than teaching people how to learn any particular technology or skill. We’ve made over 7,000 changes to the curriculum over the last 3 years. It’s truly a piece of software, it changes over time. We bring in a market-driven curriculum fully vetted through the institution.”","While coding bootcamps may be in the middle of a shakeout, technology companies around the world are still going to be struggling to fill slots with people equipped with the skills to tackle real-world problems right from the get-go — and Dan Sommer hopes the…",2018-05-31T12:00:57Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Trilogy Education gets $50M to build a market-driven bootcamp program for universities,http://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/trilogy-education-gets-50m-to-build-a-market-driven-bootcamp-program-for-universities/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/uclacodingbootcamp.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-3,1
Sam Byford,"2019 edition The American smartphone market is an increasingly boring place to be. You have Apple and Samsung at the top, LG in a distant third, then Motorola, and maybe the occasional wildcard option like Google and OnePlus collectively making up less than ten percent. If that’s all you see when you enter a phone store, you could be forgiven for having lost interest in phones altogether. As this year’s Mobile World Congress demonstrated in acute fashion, however, there is a ton of interesting stuff going on outside the States — and a whole lot of it is coming from China. 2018 was the year that Chinese manufacturers made a firm claim to be producing the most exciting and experimental phone hardware in the world, with wild designs from the likes of Oppo and Vivo. Others are competing on different terms, making phones of surprising quality at prices American buyers could only dream of. And going forward, Huawei and Xiaomi have demonstrated some of the most attractive foldable phone designs yet. But for a long and complex list of reasons, barely any compelling Chinese phones go on sale in the US beyond those from OnePlus, a company whose key designs invariably show up in Oppo phones months earlier. And while it’s technically possible to import Chinese phones, we wouldn’t often recommend it unless you’re confident that you won’t run into any issues with unfamiliar software or LTE bands. Just in case you’re interested, though, here’s what Americans are missing out on right now. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge Xiaomi Mi 9 Xiaomi’s flagship Mi series tends to combine high-end specs, conventional design, and low prices, and that’s certainly the case with the latest entry. The Mi 9 has a notched 6.4-inch OLED display, a Snapdragon 855 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, an in-screen fingerprint scanner, and a triple-camera system with three separate focal lengths. There isn’t much groundbreaking about the Mi 9 itself unless you care about wireless charging speed, but Xiaomi’s ability to price a 6GB of RAM/128GB of storage variant for just 2,999 yuan (~$450) continues to be the company’s key advantage. The Mi 9 makes even OnePlus phones look questionably priced, never mind Samsung and Apple. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 The Mi Mix is a higher-end line for Xiaomi, and ever since the original model has always been about achieving the most bezel-free design possible — no notches allowed. That tradition continues with the Mi Mix 3, which uses a magnetic slider mechanism to raise the selfie camera from behind the uninterrupted screen. There are certainly tradeoffs with this approach. The Mi Mix 3 is thicker than you’d expect for a phone with just a 3,200mAh battery, and the mechanism isn’t always easy to operate one-handed. You’ll also have to wait until May for the 5G version if you want a larger battery and this year’s Snapdragon 855 chip, and who knows how that’ll turn out. But at a starting price of 3,299 yuan (~$475) for a 6GB/128GB model, the Mi Mix 3 is still at least as compelling a value proposition as the Mi 9. Especially if you hold a personal vendetta against notches. Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge Huawei Mate 20 Pro You can’t ignore the political pressure Huawei faces in the US, but the simple fact is that the Mate 20 Pro is a big deal virtually everywhere else. Huawei’s latest flagship is an extremely good handset with an impressive Kirin 980 SoC, a strong triple-camera setup, an excellent curved OLED display, both 3D face-scanning and an in-display fingerprint sensor, and a massive battery that delivers class-leading endurance. If hardware were everything, the Mate 20 would have a very strong claim to be the best phone in the world. Unfortunately, it is not, and Huawei’s EMUI software remains one of the least elegant examples of a heavy-handed Chinese Android skin ; Xiaomi’s MIUI blows it away in terms of usability. If you can get over the software and the £899 (~$1,200) price, though, this phone is a serious contender. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Honor View 20 Huawei sub-brand Honor’s latest flagship has the same EMUI drawback, but no-one can complain about the price. Launched a couple of months ago, the View 20 has the same Kirin 980 chip as the Mate 20 Pro alongside a couple of smartphone firsts: a hole-punch LCD and an intermittently great 48-megapixel camera. You also get a large 4,000mAh battery and even a headphone jack. All of this comes in at £499 (~$650), and there’s very little to point to on the View 20 that renders it less than flagship-class. Sure, the Mate 20 Pro has wireless charging, a better camera, and an OLED screen, but overall the View 20 would be an impressive device at any price — let alone one this reasonable. It’s also the only phone on this list that should eventually get a US release, though we’ll see how that turns out. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Vivo V15 Pro The V15 Pro is Vivo’s newly announced mainstream flagship, and it brings some of the company’s high-end features from last year to a more accessible device. There’s a 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera, a speedy in-display fingerprint sensor, a 48-megapixel main camera, and — of course — an OLED screen with no notch and barely any bezels. This is also the first phone to use Qualcomm’s new mid-to-high-end Snapdragon 675 processor, and performance has been impressive in my testing. At around $400, this is an extremely compelling mid-range device if you can deal with the Micro USB port and lack of wireless charging. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Vivo Nex If you prefer the smaller pop-up selfie camera design to Oppo and Xiaomi’s more elaborate mechanisms, the highest-end option is still the original Nex. The Vivo Nex has a Snapdragon 845, a 4,000mAh battery, a giant 6.6-inch notchless screen, and both USB-C *and* a headphone jack. Vivo’s subsequent full-screen phones have been more refined in various ways, with improved in-display fingerprint sensors, better-quality selfie cameras, and more sensible screen sizes. But as one of the most decadent and feature-packed phones ever created, the original Nex still makes a statement — iridescent rainbow-dot pattern and all. Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition The Nex Dual Display Edition, on the other hand, makes the original Nex look positively restrained. Its solution to the problem of where to put the selfie camera on a bezel-less phone is… not to have one at all. Vivo just stuck another screen on the back so you can use it as a viewfinder when the regular camera is pointing at you. The camera is also surrounded by a colorful light-up “Lunar Ring” that cuts into the second screen. This mostly works fine, apart from the multiple times a day you’ll find yourself taking the phone out of your pocket and staring at a blank screen because the “switch screens” and “wake” buttons swap functionality based on the phones’ orientation and yet are indistinguishable by feel. But if you want the world’s best selfie phone and don’t mind that it might also be the world’s most fragile phone — at least until foldables arrive — this could be for you. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Oppo Find X Even though it was announced the best part of a year ago, the Oppo Find X is arguably still the most beguiling Android phone around. Its curved notchless screen and unique motorized sliding design, where the entire top panel of the phone rises up to reveal a 3D face scanner and selfie camera, make it the most convincing attempt yet at achieving the all-screen dream. Oppo later released the Find X Lamborghini Edition, which keeps the same basic specs but bundles some passable wireless earbuds and introduces one legitimately cool feature. Super VOOC makes use of a custom dual-cell design that allows you to go from 0- to 100-percent charge in just 35 minutes — an unbelievably fast time for a 3,400mAh battery. The Find X might still be using a Snapdragon 845, but it still feels cutting-edge. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Oppo F11 Pro Oppo announced the F11 Pro this week, and it’s similar to Vivo’s V15 Pro: 48-megapixel camera, pop-up selfie camera, headphone jack, Micro USB. It also has maybe my favorite gradient color scheme since China seemingly decided a year ago that all phones should look like this. The F11 Pro is a little lower-end than the V15 Pro, though: there’s no in-display fingerprint sensor, the selfie camera is 16 megapixels, and the processor is a MediaTek Helio P70. That’s reflected in the lower price of ~$350, which means it still offers pretty great value for anyone who doesn’t need the highest-end specs around. Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge Realme 3 There are literally countless budget Chinese phones I could have included here for the exact same reasons — this Realme 3 is just the most recent example. Realme is an India-focused brand spun out of Oppo, and its products make our US-targeted “ Best cheap phones you can buy ” article from last year seem sort of embarrassing. Sure, if you have $180 in the US you can get that LG K30 with chunky bezels, a 5.3-inch LCD, a 2,800mAh battery, 32GB of storage, and 2GB of RAM. Realme 3 customers in India, on the other hand, get a modern-looking 6.4-inch LCD with a tiny notch, a 4,230mAh battery, 32GB of storage, and 3GB of RAM for about $125. It’s also just $30 more for 4GB of RAM and doubles the storage to 64GB. Though at least the K30 has USB-C.","The American smartphone market is an increasingly boring place to be.

Andrew Martonik,"Some people buy cases purely for protection. They want to keep their phone safe from scrapes and drops for the lowest amount of money possible. Others want a case that enhances a phone and is more pleasing to hold than the metal-and-glass sandwiches all flagships have turned into — the Bellroy leather case for the Pixel 3 is a case for those people. A clear winner A touch of class for your glass phone There are cheaper and thinner cases, but that's not what this case is all about. The Bellroy leather case feels amazing, with a supple softness and texture you don't get with anything but natural leather. It also retains your phone's full functionality, with big cutouts and an acceptable thickness. It's worth the money for anyone who wants to elevate their case game. The Good Rich, soft leather Multiple color options Large cutouts for USB-C and fingerprint Rubber edges should hold up 3-year warranty The Bad Bulkier than a typical slim case Expensive compared to TPU offerings Bellroy knows how to do leather — and it makes this case luxurious. I won't say I've used an extensive number of leather phone cases, but the Bellroy is absolutely the best feeling of any I've touched. The leather has a subtle texture to it that just feels right, and it's on a backing with just a little bit of thickness and cushion that doesn't feel like it's simply glued to a piece of hard plastic like so many cheap ""leather"" cases out there. When you look at what Bellroy does, it all makes sense — the company makes leather goods across a variety of categories, from wallets to bags and of course accessories for electronics. The leather is tanned and dyed to ""age gracefully,"" which is exactly what you want from a quality piece of leather. The whole point of leather is that it slowly adapts to its environment; you shouldn't want it to stay pristine and featureless over time, nor do you want it to be dry and rough with some sort of coating. That doesn't mean that the Bellroy case is going to fall apart, though — the company backs up its leather cases with a three-year warranty, which is undoubtedly something you're paying a little extra for in the $45 (Pixel 3) or $50 (Pixel 3 XL) price. There's no trade-off of functionality for form. I went with perhaps the most standard natural-looking color, ""caramel,"" but Bellroy has five other tones ranging from blue and black up to coral and a limited-edition ""not pink"" to match the Pixel 3's fun color option. The lighter colors bring out the texture of the material, and I particularly enjoy how the caramel is set off by the pops of white from my Pixel 3 XL's back. The peek-a-boo looks come from sizable cutouts for the camera sensors, fingerprint sensor and USB-C port, so you won't feel encumbered trying to use the phone. The thickness of the case is about on par with the fabric Google case, which is my other current favorite. All of the leather edges are accented by a strong black rubber edge, which complements the color but are also functionally necessary to keep the leather from getting roughed up. The black edge around the front is high enough to safely place the phone face-down on a flat surface, and the edges around the other cutouts make sure they won't fray. There aren't cutouts for the side buttons, but the material is stamped out to give you a nice buildup to press them — they're a little stiff right now, but I suspect those will loosen up over time. The Bellroy leather case for the Pixel 3 ( or any phone, really is a luxurious way to protect your phone — it looks wonderful and feels just as nice. The only complaint you can have is that at $45-50 it's twice as much as most people want to pay for a case. Sure it's not the cheapest or the slimmest, but that's not the point of the Bellroy leather case. This is what it costs to get something this nice — and it is, indeed, nice.

Steven Dufresne,"Levers are literally all around us. You body uses them to move, pick up a pen to sign your name and you’ll use mechanical advantage to make that ballpoint roll, and that can of soda doesn’t open without a cleverly designed lever. I got onto this topic quite by accident. I was making an ornithopter and it was having trouble lifting its wings. For the uninitiated, ornithopters are machines which fly by flapping their wings. The problem was that the lever arm was too short. To be honest, as I worked I wasn’t even thinking in terms of levers, and only realized that there was one after I’d fine-tuned its length by trial and error. After that, the presence of a lever was embarrassingly obvious. I can probably be excused for not seeing a lever right away because it wasn’t the type we most often experience. There are different classes of levers and it’s safe to say that most people aren’t even aware of this. Let’s take a closer look at these super useful, and sometimes hidden mechanisms known as levers. Levers Are One of the Oldest Mechanisms Archimedes Claw lifting ship. Image source Drexel University Technically speaking, levers predate humanity. You find them in biology — your forearm is a good example which I’ll go into later in the article. When it comes to man made mechanisms, levers are suspected to have been used as long ago as Ancient Egypt for lifting large block and obelisks but the earliest writings of their working principle come from followers of Aristotle and from Archimedes, both dated around 300 BC. Archimedes gave this static description of it: Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights. He also famously said, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.” Putting this into practice, he’s reputed to have devised a defensive weapon called the Claw for fighting off ships attacking city walls. Historical accounts seem to describe a crane sitting on the wall which lowers a grappling hook onto attacking ships and lifts them out of the water, capsizing or sinking them. Lever Principles As shown here, a lever consists of a beam which pivots on a fulcrum. A force, called the effort F e is applied at some distance a from the fulcrum. And a load F l exists at some distance b from the fulcrum. The law of the lever states that: The ratio of the force at the load to the effort force is equal to the ratio of the distances of those forces from the fulcrum. Mathematically, it can be stated as: MA = F l /F e = a/b MA stands for Mechanical Advantage and is a measure of how much the force is amplified. The formula shows that if length a from the fulcrum to the effort is greater than length b from the fulcrum to the load, then the mechanical advantage will be greater than one. Note that we’re not talking about free energy here. The power input is equal to the power output, ignoring losses due to friction, wear, and bending of the lever beam. Power is force multiplied by velocity and they differ proportionately from each other. If a &gt; b then the load will move more slowly than the point where the effort is applied (which must move a greater distance in the same amount of time). Classes of Levers Levers can be arranged in different ways and are described in three classes, all of which follow the law of the lever. Class 1 Levers Class 1 is perhaps the most familiar. Examples of that are a seesaw, a crowbar as well as any time you’ve picked up a stick and placed it on a handy pivot point to lift something heavy at the other end of the stick. A pair of pliers are class 1 levers which we use very often but rarely recognize them as such. Class 2 Levers With a Class 2 lever, the fulcrum is moved to one end of the lever, with the load in the middle and the force at the other end. Every time you pick up a wheelbarrow you use a class 2 lever, with the wheel’s axle is the fulcrum. Class 3 Levers The arrangement of the class 3 lever can be the most difficult to visualize. The fulcrum is still at one end of the lever, but the effort is now in the middle, with the load at the opposite end. It’s harder to think of everyday class 3 examples but we’ll see three of them below. When we look at an exoskeleton arm, a human arm, and a rubber band driven ornithopter wing we’re viewing class 3 levers. James’ Exoskeleton Levers I searched for a great example of a lever in a hacker made project and came up with a great one by our very own [James Hobson]. He built an exoskeleton with arms for lifting heavy loads. Interestingly, each arm contained both a class 1 and a class 3 lever. The arm is actuated by pistons. The main difference between class 1 and class 3 levers is that the load and the fulcrum have been switched. Here you can see that the location of the rear piston creates a class 1 lever, the location of the front piston creates a class 3 lever. You can see him use the rig to curl a 170 pound barbell. Human arm as a class 3 lever. Image source: Robotpark Levers In The Human Body With all its muscles, bones, and joints, it should be no surprise that the human body makes abundant use of levers. However, they’re not always used for mechanical advantage. In the case of lifting a load by raising the lower arm and using the elbow as the fulcrum, the effort is provided by a muscle in the upper arm. This muscle is attached to the lever (the bone) very close to the fulcrum, meaning that a is short compared to b, which extends from the fulcrum to the load in the hand (in the diagram, R stands for Resistance). Therefore the mechanical advantage a / b is less than one. Instead, the benefit here is that a small movement of the bone at the muscle produces a large movement at the hand. This makes for a compact and agile arm which can be useful in tight spaces. A lifting muscle which instead extends from the shoulder to near the wrist would get in the way much of the time. Note that James has done a similar thing with his exoskeleton arm, though he added the second piston to push while the other pulls/lifts. The Ornithopter’s Lever The typical rubber band powered ornithopter has a fuselage running down the middle that acts as the main body to which all the parts are connected. At the bottom of the ornithopter’s fuselage is a crank which is turned by a twisted rubber band. Connecting rods connect the wings to the crank. Turning the crank raises and lowers the wings through the connecting rods. This raising and lowering can be seen clearly in the animated GIF. Looking at the diagrams, the fulcrum is in the middle of the ornithopter, at the top of the fuselage. It’s there where each wing pivots as they flap up and down. The load is actually the air pressing on a wing membrane as the wing is pushed up or pulled down, though my issue was most evident when pushing up. The effort is applied from below, where the connecting rods connect to each wing. The non-obvious lever in my ornithopter turned out to be a combination of two different classes of levers, a class 2 and 3 lever, both of which exist in each wing. Class 2 Lever The class 2 lever is the section from the fulcrum to where the effort is applied by the connecting rod connected to the wing. The load which makes it a class 2 lever is the air pressure on the section of wing extending back between those two points. This fits the definition of a class 2 lever because the load is in the middle, between the fulcrum and the effort. Class 3 Lever The class 3 lever is again formed by the fulcrum and the effort at the connecting rod, but the load is the air pressure on the wing on the side farther from the effort in the opposite direction of the fulcrum. This fits the definition of a class 3 lever because the effort is in the middle, between the load and the fulcrum. Seeing Levers Everywhere So while levers don’t always stand out, they are found in a large number of places. That’s doubtless due to how useful they are. We’d like to hear in the comments below where you’ve used levers or which surprising places you’ve found them in.","Levers are literally all around us.

Aarian Marshall,"The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal fraud investigation into Tesla, after CEO Elon Musk last month announced on Twitter he was considering taking the automaker private, and had “funding secured” to do so. Musk later revealed that the funding required to go private at $420 per share, which he had initially believed would mostly come from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, wasn’t exactly locked down. Seventeen days after that initial tweet, in late August, Tesla declared it would remain a public company after all l—but the backtracking hasn’t stemmed the fallout from the incident. Bloomberg’s report of the probe sent Tesla shares down nearly 10 percent early this morning. (Stocks ultimately closed down 3 percent on Tuesday evening.) While the Justice Department’s probe appears to be at a very early and not yet consequential phase, the report could indicate yet another problem for Tesla and its embattled CEO—to go with a reported Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and class-action shareholder lawsuits over the same issue, and a libel lawsuit filed against Musk by the man whom Musk accused of being a pedophile, and a stream of departures by high-level executives. Most crucially, it would add to ongoing questions about Tesla’s production capacity and profit margins as it works to ramp up the rollout of its Model 3 sedan. In a statement, a Tesla spokesperson says the DOJ did send Tesla a voluntary request for documents and that the automaker has been cooperating. “We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DOJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received,” the statement said. A DOJ spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation into Tesla. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also reportedly looking into the “going private” statements and whether the “funding secured” tweet was materially false, or even an attempt to manipulate the company’s stock price. The Fox Business Network initially reported that the federal agency subpoenaed the electric carmaker in mid-August. Many SEC investigations take months or years, and end without the agency bringing a civil suit or enforcement action. If it’s true that the Justice Department has not issued Tesla any subpoenas, that indicates its probe, reportedly being handled in San Francisco, remains in its early stages. “It’s something that happens at the very beginning of the process,” says Jay Dubow, a partner specializing in white collar litigation at the law firm Pepper Hamilton. “It’s just nosing around.” It’s common for issues to be investigated by both the Department of Justice and SEC, Dubow notes, because federal securities law violations can be prosecuted criminally or civilly. If federal investigators find that Elon Musk purposely misled investors and the public to goose Tesla’s stock price, then he, the company, and/or other employees involved could face fines, penalties like being forced to take a timeouts from roles in the public company—and, possibly, prison time, says Stephen Diamond, who studies who studies securities law and corporate governance at the Santa Clara University School of Law. “The SEC only has the ability to get monetary relief. The DOJ has the ability to put someone in jail,” Diamond says. If both the SEC and DOJ find evidence of some sort of violation and decide to move forward with their investigations, the two packs of lawyers would share information, legal experts say. If the DOJ moves forward with its probe, it would impanel a grand jury and issue subpoenas, which could eventually lead to indictments. Again, it’s early. “There are a lot of facts we don’t know here,” says Dubow. We do know, though, that Tesla has faced a barrage of bad news in recent months—steadily driving down the automaker’s stock price, and pushing some shareholders to question Musk’s leadership as Tesla’s CEO and chairman. On Monday, British diver and cave explorer Vernon Unsworth sued Musk for libel in a California district court. (The filing said another suit, this one to be pursued in the United Kingdom, will follow). The lawsuit comes two months after Musk called Unsworth “pedo guy” on Twitter, following an interview in which the Brit denigrated Musk’s attempt to build a mini-submarine that could rescue a group of Thai boys trapped in a cave. Though Musk later deleted and apologized for the tweet, he doubled down on the pedophilia claim a month later, claiming to BuzzFeed News that Unsworth was a “child rapist” who had married a 12-year-old while living in Thailand. The suit (which notes Unsworth is in a relationship with a 40-year-old woman) cites Musk’s tweets extensively, and seeks more than $75,000 in compensatory damages. However those cases turn out for Musk, the clearest determinant of his company’s nearterm future will be Tesla’s October quarterly earnings report, when the automaker will reveal how many cars are produced and sold in the third quarter of the year. The automaker finally hit its goal of making 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week at the end of the second quarter, a rate it hopes to sustain as it strives toward profitability. The news of the DOJ’s preliminary investigation, though, compounds questions about whether Musk needs to divide his responsibilities as company chairman and CEO into two roles, or hire a number two to help him steer the electric automaker toward that goal—and whether the current corporate board is willing to make that hard call. “The reported DOJ investigation ramps up the concern about the current governance structure of the company,” says Diamond. “At minimum, it’s a cloud over Tesla.” More Great WIRED Stories","The reported criminal probe is likely in its early stages, but darkens an already gloomy sky gathering over Elon Musk's automaker.",2018-09-18T23:15:50Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",A DOJ Probe Into Elon's Tweets Could Spell Yet More Trouble for Tesla,https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-elon-musk-doj-investigation/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ba12e275031ce6b87548356/191:100/pass/Tesla-583551646.jpg,wired,Wired,class-3,1

"Nicole Dieker on Two Cents, shared by Nicole Dieker to Lifehacker","How much is your side hustle currently bringing in? How much do you think itll earn this year, based on your first-quarter revenue?
(Ill wait while you do the math.)
Next question: how much are you spending on your side hustle? Is it more or less than what youre earning?
Gross income is great, but the new tax laws have gotten a lot stricter on whether you can deduct those expenses youre racking up as you pursue your side hustle. This means that if your side hustle isnt hustling up a profit, you might have to classify it as a hobbyand lose out on potential tax savings.
Freelancers and side hustlers: how much money do you want to make this year?
Read more Read
The basic business vs. hobby rules are still the same: to qualify as a business, you need to make a profit in three out of the past five years. To quote IRS Publication 535: 
An activity is presumed carried on for profit if it produced a profit in at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. 
(Theres an exception for people who breed, show, train, or race horsesthey only have to show a profit for two out of the last seven years, probably because horses are expensive.)
If your side hustle qualifies as a business, youll report your income and expenses on a Schedule C and will be able to deduct qualified business expenses from your taxes. That also remains unchanged.
However, taxpayers used to be able to itemize and deduct some hobby expenses from their taxes as well, even if their money-making endeavor didnt qualify as an official small business. As The Washington Post reports, the new tax laws have eliminated that deduction:
In the past, you could claim hobby expenses as part of the class of miscellaneous itemized deductions that needed to exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income, [IRS spokesperson Eric Smith] said. But that category of deductions was eliminated under tax reform.
Previously, you could deduct expenses from a hobby up to the income it generated as personal itemized deductions, as long as you met the 2 percent threshold. However, starting in 2018 and up until 2025, this deduction is no longer allowed.
What does that mean for you? If your side hustle has more expenses than income, and you havent earned a profit in three out of the past five years, youll have to classify it as a hobby.
If you are starting a side hustle and it hasnt made a profit yetbut you think it might earn a profit in three out of the next five yearsyou can file IRS Form 5213, Election To Postpone Determination as To Whether the Presumption Applies That an Activity Is Engaged in for Profit.
(If youve read all of this and feel more confused than when you started, you can always hire a CPA or tax preparer to help you.)
Most importantly: if your side hustle isnt bringing in any profit, you can start cutting business expenses or working on growing your income. Do it for the sake of your businesss bottom lineor your own bottom line, because that money youre spending on an unprofitable business is probably coming out of your own pocketand do it for the sake of your tax return.
Or, you could always accept that your side hustle is really a side hobby. Not every hobby has to become a full-fledged business, after all.

Sam Rutherford,"At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs. But among Acer’s avalanche of metal and silicon, there was one device that felt like an anchor for the company’s growth and success: the new Chromebook Spin 13. For years, Acer has made some of the best Chromebooks you could buy, and with the new 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 13, Acer is keeping the newfound flexibility found on last year’s R13, while upping the ante with a new an all new, more premium feeling design. 1 / 5 Taking a cue from the Google Pixelbook, the Chromebook Spin 13 features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of a traditional 16:9 ldisplay. Then, Acer went and replaced the big long hinge on the R13 with a more standard two-sided setup, before tacking on a new one-piece Gorilla Glass touchpad. And unlike Acer Chromebooks of old couple years ago, the Spin 13 sports a full metal chassis that should give it some added durability and a touch of class. The Chromebook Spin 13 shouldn’t be hurting on power either thanks to your choice of 8th-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 CPUs, up to 16GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage. The Spin 13 even features built-in Wacom stylus support (including an onboard hidey hold for stashing the active pen when its not in use), so you can save handwritten notes or sketches with ease. But perhaps the best thing about the Chromebook Spin 13 is that it looks like its going to cost half the price of Google’s slick, but expensive $1,000 Pixelbook. Prices are going to start at $400 for a non-2-in-1 Chromebook 13, while the the 13 Spin will command a $100 premium on top of that. And just in case you wanted something slightly bigger, Acer is also making 15-inch versions of its new Chromebook, including the new $450 Chromebook Spin 15, which Acer claims is the world’s first 15-inch Chrome OS convertible.","At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","Because getting a college education isnt expensive enough, the fees for taking the SAT and ACT tests as part of the admissions process can be a hardship for many high school students and their families.
Vox breaks down the costs:
Currently, it costs $47.50 to take the SAT ($64.50 with the Essay portion), and $22 for each of the SAT subject tests, not including the $26 registration fee. The ACT costs $50.50 ($67 with the Writing portion), and for each test there are extra costs for late registration. Advanced Placement (AP) tests cost $94. 
Add in the fact that many college counselors recommend taking the test multiple times to use the best scores, and the numbers can get out of hand very quickly.
Some colleges and universities are de-emphasizing the need for SAT and ACT test results, particularly if students meet a minimum grade point average or class rank. Functionally speaking, however, these tests are still very much ingrained in the college application process. 
Low-income high school students may qualify for fee waivers, though, if they meet certain requirements. The College Board details who is eligible for SAT fee waivers, as well as how to apply:
Youre eligible for fee waivers if you say yes to any of the following:
Youre enrolled in or eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
Your annual family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
Youre enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., Federal TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
Your family receives public assistance.
You live in federally subsidized public housing or a foster home, or are homeless.
You are a ward of the state or an orphan.
Similarly, the ACT fees are waived for students who meet these criteria:
1. They are currently enrolled in high school in the 11th or 12 grade.
2. Are testing in the United States, U.S. territories or Puerto Rico.
3. Meet one or more of these indicators of economic need:
Are enrolled in a federal free or reduced-price lunch program at school, based on the USDAs income levels.
Are enrolled in a program for the economically disadvantaged, such as federally funded programs like GEAR UP or Upward Bound.
Reside in a foster home, is a ward of the state or is homeless.
Family receives low-income public assistance or lives in federally subsidized public housing.
Familys total annual income is at or below USDA levels for free or reduced-price lunches on the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.
Contact your childs school counselor for help with the fee waiver application process or to determine whether you qualify.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Microsoft’s Surface line of Windows 10 PCs have mostly been marketed as premium devices. But according to a new Bloomberg report, the company is planning to bring back a good ol’ fashioned cheap Surface, most likely to get in on some of that sweet sweet iPad money Apple’s been raking in (or to give us something to buy if we can’t afford its giant 4K touchscreen ). Bloomberg reports the inexpensive Surface will be different from Microsoft’s previously scrapped 8-inch Surface Mini, and use a 10-inch display. That puts the cheap Surface closer to iPad territory, but with a rumored price of around $400, it’s still more expensive than Apple’s cheapest iPad, which starts at $329 and now has Apple Pencil support. The new device will reportedly run on an Intel processor, have storage options up to 128GB, support optional integrated LTE, and use Windows 10 Pro, so you can certainly bet it’ll support Microsoft’s own Surface Pen accessories. And yeah, the kickstand will probably be there, too. The company’s no stranger to cheap devices. The Surface 3, released in 2015, started at $500, but was too expensive considering what you were getting. And the first Surface device, released back in 2012, was the $349 Surface RT, but it didn’t run what you’d traditionally consider “Windows.” It ran the ill-fated Windows RT, Microsoft’s version of Windows 8 built for mobile devices. To say the original Surface was a flop is an understatement, but most of the blame laid with the green and unimpressive Windows RT. As an inexpensive competitor to the iPad running a desktop operating system, it may be easier to stomach buying a Surface for a class of unruly children. The rumored device might also be just good enough for someone who needs some sort of portable device that lets you use a track pad or mouse. Just remember, you’ll probably have to pay extra for the keyboard cover. And the LTE support. And the Surface Pen. And the extra storage.

Devin Coldewey,"It’s finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy’s first mission, and SpaceX’s heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time. The launch will take a major communications satellite into orbit, and as an encore all three of the first stages will attempt to return to Earth and make soft landings. Success means the inauguration of a new era in spaceflight.
Falcon Heavy was first tested last February, with a dummy payload of a Tesla Roadster and a mannequin dubbed “Starman,” now somewhere past the orbit of Mars. Since then the rocket has gained a few improvements, including a reinforced center core that should help enable it to return safely.
In addition to taking an enormous satellite to orbit, SpaceX will be attempting to recover all three first stages and the fairing that covers the payload as well. The side stages will be guiding themselves to Landing Zone 1 and 2 nearby the launch complex, while the center core, having traveled much further, will land on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship Of Course I Still Love You. Other boats will attempt to catch both pieces of the falling fairing.
It bears mentioning here that not only are there essentially no launch vehicles in Falcon Heavy’s class, but certainly none that can autonomously return to Earth and be used again. SpaceX is very far out ahead of the competition here, though the next few years will see new entrants in the field. But this will be a first for several reasons.
The 230-foot assembly, all brand new rockets (rather than reused), is currently standing up at Launch Complex 39A, the site of many historic launches, from Apollo to Space Shuttle. T-0 is this evening at 6:35 local time in Cape Canaveral. You can watch it live below or at the SpaceX webcast site.
The important events we’ll be on the watch for will occur roughly as follows, in approximate minutes and seconds after takeoff:
1:09 after launch: Max-Q, the point at which the launch vehicle is under the most strain. As reliable as rockets have become, every launch is a white-knuckler until after this point.
2:30: BECO, or booster engine cutoff, when the side cores shut off and detach.
3:31: MECO, or main engine cutoff, when the central core shuts down and detaches from the second stage, which ignites a few seconds afterwards. The fairings will detach about 30 seconds later.
7:51: Side cores descend at LZ for landing.
8:48: Second stage first burn concludes and cruise phase begins.
9:48: Main core descends at drone ship for landing.
???: Fairing descends over ocean to be caught. Timing is unclear on this, but it probably will be a few minutes after the main core lands.
27:34: Second stage second burn begins, lasting 1:26.
34:02: Arabsat-6A detaches from launch vehicle and continues under its own power. At this point SpaceX will have completed its mission, though it will take some time for the satellite to arrive at its geosynchronous orbit.
We’ll be watching too, and will update this post with any relevant new info.","It's finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy's first mission, and SpaceX's heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time.

Bryan Menegus,"A lawsuit filed in August of 2014 on behalf of California Uber drivers is finally paying out, and recipients of the $7.75 million settlement are finding their share leaves something to be desired. Back in August of 2014, a driver named Steven Price sued Uber for damages resulting from alleged labor misclassification, including failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, missed meal periods and rest periods, and unlawful business practices. In short, Price claimed Uber drivers were employees the company was treating as contractors, a scheme that has become a staple of the gig economy, most visibly affecting rideshare drivers, last-mile package couriers, and those engaged in food delivery or personal shopping. That suit was settled in late January of this year, and payments were scheduled to arrive on or before last Friday. That $7.75 million was split among “any and all Drivers who consented to a background check as part of the sign-up process to use the Uber software application and/or used the Uber software application to generate leads in California at anytime from July 8,2013 up to and including January 29, 2017,” according to the settlement. But after plaintiffs’ attorney fees, administration costs, and allocations to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, the amount apportioned to drivers was less than $1 million. Even though the time period covered by the suit represents three and a half years, a number of drivers posting on Reddit and other ridershare driver forums describe payments of less than $20 —some drastically so. Three drivers sent Gizmodo copies of the notices they received. One was awarded $7.05. Another, 75 cents. The third was given just 15 cents. Though we were unable to verify settlement amounts beyond these three claims before publication, other posts suggest $3 to $5 was average. This is partly a result of the structure of California’s Private Attorneys General Act—a law for employee recovery of civil penalties in labor violations—and with class-action suits in general. But these meager payouts also read as an insult following the uproar around a recent study that found around half of rideshare drivers made below minimum wage.

Adam Rosenberg,"There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news. Bungie dusted off and updated a fresh batch exotic gear from the first Destiny, and will be adding it all to the Destiny 2 loot pool with the release of the May 8 expansion. In all, there are seven returning exotics that we know of. SEE ALSO: 'Destiny 2' gets Warmind and a major update this week. Here's the deal. Because I'm a monster, I decided to rank them. It's mostly armor, so your own ranking is probably super different, and entirely dependent on which class you prefer to play. Personally, I think Warlocks are a trash character class with a trash jump, and you'll see that reflected here. All of which is to say: Please enjoy my 100 percent scientific, completely official, and impossible to argue ranking of Warmind 's returning Destiny exotics. (Note: This ranking assumes all of this returning gear works just like it did in the original Destiny. I might re-rank them after Warmind is out and all secrets are revealed. But this is really just for fun, folks. Don't have a cow.) 7. Suros Regime Image: bungie Look. Any serious Destiny fan knows that Suros is actually #1 here. It's the only weapon in this lineup, for one. But more than that: It's freaking Suros Regime. One of the best weapons in the original game. Not only can it heal you as it deals damage, the bottom half of its magazine also deals bonus damage. For some Destiny players, this is the only exotic they ever used. Suros gets the bottom-rung nod mostly because it's the only weapon here, and it's always fun to start these dumb lists with a curveball. Or hey, let's say it's because the gun is blue now. Sure. That works. Suros is blue and that's bad. 6. Claws of Ahamkara Image: bungie As we've already discussed, Warlocks are trash. They're better in Destiny 2, sure, but their jump still sucks. The Claws of Ahamkara are a Warlock exotic, so instant demerit there. They also come with a fairly useless ability, which is a real problem for a class of gear that's supposed to make you feel powerful. Equip the Claws and you can charge up to two melee attacks instead of the usual one. It's the height of meh. Let's also not overlook the physical makeup of this thing you've willingly chosen to equip. It's basically a bunch of golden feathers protruding from your wrist, with all of them held in place by what appears to be a snap-on leather BDSM restraint. It's... different! But it's not going to up your Destiny 2 game. Sorry Claws of Ahamkara, you lose. 5. Apotheosis Veil Image: bungie Oh hey, look at that. Another Warlock exotic. Woopity scoop. Apotheosis Veil is somehow less useful than Claws of Ahamkara. It's got an exotic perk fully heals you and recharges your melee/grenade attacks whenever you activate your super. That's... nice. You really shouldn't be popping your super when you're at low health, though. Not unless you're wearing Apotheosis Veil, I guess. But why would you? There are better options. Looks alone give this one the edge over Claws of Ahamkara. What the hell is going on in there? Can our Warlock friend breathe? Is there some kind of cool space gas in there that activates your so-so exotic perk? Apotheosis Veil gives good screenshot, but little more than that. 4. Sealed Ahamkara Grasps Image: bungie Visually, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are a step up from the Claws' BDSM feathers. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these Hunter gauntlets. It's like someone polished and shaped a pile of fossils and glued it onto a sci-fi gauntlet. These rank higher than the Claws of Ahamkara largely because Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are not a Warlock exotic. The perk is also just provably better: You still get to charge up to two melee attacks, but you also have a chance of automatically reloading your weapon whenever you deal melee damage. It's almost as if Destiny itself is out to troll Warlocks. 3. Eternal Warrior Image: Bungie Eternal Warrior has one edge here over all the other exotics: It looks the coolest. It's a helmet that has its own face. What more do you need to know? It's also useful! Assuming it works the way its predecessor did, Titans get added damage resistance whenever their Fist of Havoc super is active. Eternal Warrior also makes Fist of Havoc last even longer. Most of all: It's not Warlock gear. Huge bonus for this (or any other) helmet. 2. Armamentarium Image: Bungie Armamentarium is what the Punisher would wear if he existed in the Destiny universe. Look at this thing. Those rows of bullets. The two breast grenades. A pair of Liefeld-ian pouches. This is an exotic for the Titan that is ready to go to war. It also happens to come with one of the most useful exotic perks in the game: Two grenades. It may not be as flashy as some of the others, but being able to store up as many as two grenade charges is never not useful in Destiny, especially for Titans, one of the most powerful grenade classes in the game. There are always things worth chucking grenades at in Destiny 2. 1. Fr0st-EE5 Image: bungie The Hunter is Destiny 2 's forgotten class, and that's a real shame for me, self-professed Hunter 4 Lyfe. But with the Fr0st-EE5 (pronounced ""frosteez"") coming back, that's all going to change. See all the tubes coming out of the boots in the image above? Those things charge up with power when you're sprinting around. That power then feeds into your abilities, speeding up your melee and grenade regeneration while you're running (you can also turn faster). Hey, you know what's terrible in Destiny 2 ? The recharge time on melee attacks and grenades. Bring on the Fr0st-EE5, baby. To lightly paraphrase what a wise Star Wars man once said: They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts. You can buy Destiny 2 here.","There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news.

She's relatively slow with a top speed of 23 knots. So, when you look at a Blue Ridge-class ship, you may wonder to yourself, ""just what the heck is this thing's purpose?"" The short answer: She's the brains of the fleet. To be more precise, she's there to ""provide command and control for fleet commanders"" according to the United States Navy. But it's not entirely uncommon for a lesser-armed ship to take on such an important role. Back in World War II, the auxiliary USS Argonne (AG 31) served as a flagship in the South Pacific for Admiral William F. Halsey. The transport USS MacCawley (APA 4) was used as the flagship for Admiral Richmond ""Kelly"" Turner until its loss in a friendly fire incident in 1943. The United States even converted a pair of amphibious ships, USS Coronado (APF 11) and USS LaSalle (AGF 3), to act as fleet flagships during the Cold War.

As a small, mobile command post, it is much less vulnerable to attacks from terrorists or enemies. There's a lot of ocean to hide in, so you have to search really hard to find it. If worst comes to worst, the Blue Ridge does have some emergency firepower. For self-defense, the ship is outfitted with two Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems. These 20mm guns are a last-ditch defense against incoming missiles, but this ship is intended to be well out of harm's way. Its primary weapons are its array of communications antennae, allowing commanders to handle operations across an entire theater if need be.

INSIDER contacted the school system for more information. 
 At least 10 families in the Loudoun County Public Schools system complained, Byard told WRC-TV. Parents also brought the issue to the attention of the local NAACP chapter and its president, Michelle Thomas.

Erica Klarreich,"""Nadie te quita lo bailado.” (No one can take from you what you’ve danced.) For Federico Ardila, this Latin American expression epitomizes his approach to life and mathematics. It’s the driving force behind the parties he DJs in venues across the San Francisco Bay Area, where people dance till morning to the beats of his native Colombia. The dance floor is a place “where you have your freedom and you have your power, and nobody can take that away from you,” Ardila said. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. He taught the expression to his students at San Francisco State University, where he is a math professor, after giving them a punishingly hard exam. San Francisco State has a highly diverse student body, and Ardila, who just turned 40, is a prominent voice in the mathematics community about how to make students from underrepresented groups— such as women and people of color—feel that they belong. But on this occasion, as he looked around at his students’ demoralized faces, he knew he had missed the mark. “Nadie te quita lo bailado,” Ardila told his students. “I think that’s a very powerful message—that nobody can take away from you the joy that you’ve had doing mathematics,” he told Quanta Magazine in an interview last month. “And people can give you grades, but that’s not going to take away the freedom that you felt and the fulfillment that you felt.” The expression also applies to Ardila’s research, though not always in ways he would have chosen. Four years ago in Portland, Oregon, a thief smashed his car window and made off with a backpack containing, as luck would have it, five years’ worth of work—all of Ardila’s notes from a sweeping new paper he was developing. Proofs, examples, counterexamples and conjectures were all gone. But the thief couldn’t steal the mathematics Ardila had “danced” in his mind. Over the past few years, Ardila and his coauthor, Marcelo Aguiar of Cornell University, have painstakingly reconstructed their work unifying the geometric and algebraic sides of combinatorics—the study of discrete structures like a social network, a sudoku puzzle, or a phylogenetic tree. They finally posted their 113-page paper online in September, and in January Ardila will be presenting their work in an invited address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the biggest annual math conference in the United States. Quanta spoke with Ardila at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, where he is visiting for the fall semester, about the mathematics he has danced and taught. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Your mathematical talent was identified quite early—in fourth grade, you got the highest score in your age group in a national math competition in Colombia. It was actually my sister, Natalia, who first showed great promise in mathematics. I was just the little brother. She and my cousin Ana María, they both performed really, really well in this national math competition. And I think the organizers probably said, “OK, these two women are very good, and then here’s the little brother who’s coming along to the awards ceremony. Maybe he’s OK also.” I feel like from a young age, they were paying attention to me. I never enjoyed mathematics in school very much, but my experience through the Math Olympics was much more creative and much more playful. Federico Ardila as a child in Colombia with his mother, Amparo, and his sister, Natalia. And it turned out that it was, as many of these spaces are, a very male-dominated space, and eventually both my sister and my cousin felt uncomfortable with this space. I mean, they’re doing amazing things now; my cousin is an engineer and my sister is a music pedagogy professor. But I do think it’s kind of interesting—that was a space where I felt very comfortable and that felt very nurturing to me, and it didn’t feel so to other people. It was a space that was very “othering” for them. I think that’s always served to remind me of the role of a mathematician, of an educator, in curating the culture of a place. That’s why that’s been such a theme in my work. You’ve said that you were surprised to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where you did your undergraduate and doctoral studies. What’s the story there? I had never heard of MIT. And it hadn’t crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and apply. At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not like being told, “Read this” or “Think this way.” I just kind of wanted to do things on my own terms. I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have applied with that kind of transcript. I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that we’re not eligible or that we’re not good enough. And especially if you’re somebody who feels “othered” in your discipline or who feels like you’re lacking confidence, it’s easy to close doors on yourself. There’s a lot of people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you can’t do it for yourself. When you came to the United States, as an undergraduate at MIT, it was your turn to feel like the “other.” It’s not that anybody did anything to mistreat me or to doubt me or to explicitly make me feel unwelcome, but I definitely felt very different. I mean, my mathematical education was outstanding and I had fantastic access to professors and really interesting material, but I only realized in retrospect that I was extremely isolated. There’s a system in place that makes certain people comfortable and others uncomfortable, I think just by the nature of who’s in the space. And I say that without wanting to point fingers, because I think you can be critical about the spaces that “other” you, but you also have to be critical about the ways in which you “other” other people. I think because mathematics sees itself as very objective, we think we can just say, “Well, logically, this seems to make sense that we’re doing everything correctly.” I think sometimes we’re a little bit oblivious as to what is the culture of a place, or who feels welcome, or what are we doing to make them feel welcome? So when I try to create mathematical spaces, I try to be very mindful of letting people be their full human selves. And I hope that will give people more access to tools and opportunities. What are some of the ways you do that in your teaching? In a classroom I’m the professor, and so in some sense I’m the culture keeper. And one thing that I try to do—and it’s a little bit scary and it’s not easy—is to really try to shift the power dynamic and make sure that students feel like equally powerful contributors to the place. I try to create spaces where we’re kind of together constructing a mathematical reality. So, for example, I taught a combinatorics class, and in every single class every single student did something active and communicated their mathematical ideas to somebody else. The structure of the class was such that they couldn’t just sit there and be passive. I believe in the power of music, and so I got each one of them to play a song for the rest for us at the beginning of each class. At the beginning it felt like this wild experiment where I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I was really moved by their responses. Some of them would dedicate the song to their mom and talk about how whenever they’re studying math, they’re very aware that their mom worked incredibly hard to give them the opportunity to be the first ones in their family to go to college. Another student played this song in Arabic called “Freedom.” And she was talking about how in this day and age it’s very difficult for her to feel at home and welcome and free in this country, and how mathematics for her is a place where nobody can take her freedom away. That classroom felt like no other classroom that I’ve ever taught in. It was a very human experience, and it was one of the richest math classrooms that I’ve had. I think one worries when you do that, “Are you covering enough mathematics?” But when students are engaged so actively and when you really listen to their ideas, then magic happens that you couldn’t have done by preparing a class and just delivering it. Mathematics has this stereotype of being an emotionless subject, but you describe it in very emotional terms—for instance, in course curricula you promise your students a “joyful” experience. I think doing mathematics is tremendously emotional, and I think that anybody who does mathematics knows this. I just don’t think that we have the emotional awareness or vocabulary to talk about this as a community. But you walk around this building and people are making these discoveries, and there are so many emotions going on—a lot of frustration and a lot of joy. I think one thing that happens is we don’t acknowledge this as a culture—because mathematics is emotional in sometimes very difficult ways. It can really make you feel very bad about yourself sometimes. You can be pushing on something for six months and then have it collapse, and that hurts. I don’t think we talk about that hurt enough. And the joy of discovering something after six months of working on it is really deep. Your own research is in combinatorics. And the paper you’ll be presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings connects two different ways of understanding combinatorial structures, through the lenses of geometry and algebra. How do those two approaches work? When you look at the geometric side of things, suppose, for example, you want to study the permutations (the ways of rearranging a collection of objects). It’s pretty well known that if you have n objects, the number of ways of putting them in a row is n factorial (the product n ( n -1)( n -2)…1). So it’s not a very interesting problem to count how many ways there are. But what is their inherent structure? The three-dimensional permutahedron, a geometric depiction of the ways to rearrange the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Two permutations are connected by an edge if one can be transformed into the other by swapping two consecutive numbers. If you look at when two permutations are related to each other by just swapping two elements, then you start understanding not only how many there are but how are they related to each other. And then, when you say, “OK, let’s take all the permutations, and put an edge between two of them if they’re a swap away,” then you find that you get this beautiful shape that’s a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides). I think it’s completely surprising initially that the inherent relations between permutations are captured in this beautiful polytope called a permutahedron. So all of a sudden you have this geometric model, and you can use tools from polytope theory to try to say new things about permutations. And that polytope has existed for a long time and is very well understood. And then you can also think of permutations algebraically—there’s a natural sort of “multiplication” on permutations, in which the product of two permutations is the permutation you get by doing one permutation after the other. This is one of the most important objects in algebra, this group of permutations. There are these two traditions, to take combinatorial objects and either make them geometric or make them algebraic. This project with Marcelo Aguiar was about trying to bring together these two points of view, and in fact we discovered that polytopes like the permutahedra have an additional related algebraic structure. I think we found a really beautiful connection between the geometric and the algebraic structure of combinatorial objects. We got a dozen results just from building this architecture and then reaping the benefits. For many, though by no means all, mathematicians, teaching takes a back seat to research. But for you, it seems that teaching and research are very much intertwined. You often give your students open-ended problems, and you’ve co-authored many papers with students. I love working with students. And I love sharing the joy of discovery with them. Most of my students are master’s and undergrad students, because San Francisco State doesn’t have a PhD program. I think that has steered my research to things that are more immediately accessible. But still, I need the questions to be very deep. I’m very excited about my research. I think I’m doing the most interesting research of my life right now. People tell you at 40 you start declining, and I feel like I’m getting good now. Federico Ardila DJing at the 2017 Life Is Living Festival in Oakland. Almost a decade ago you founded a DJ collective based in Oakland. How does that tie into your work as a mathematician and teacher? When I DJ I’m really looking for joy, and I’m looking to create an atmosphere where people can build bridges and connect. My professor side comes out a little bit, because I play a lot of stuff that people don’t know, and I try to play music from many places that they haven’t thought about. I also see music as a tool for social change.

Rita Liao,"BMW has joined a handful of automakers to compete with transportation upstart Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s Chinese business in 2016. Last Friday, the German luxury carmaker launched a premium ride-hailing service in Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan Province with over 14 million people. The new offer is part of BMW’s ReachNow carsharing brand that kicked off an electric vehicle rental business with a local partner last December. The new ride-hailing venture manages a crew of trained drivers to chauffer riders in a fleet of 200 BMW 5 Series, out of which half are plug-in-hybrid, according to the company. We are excited to offer our new premium ride-hailing service in Chengdu, one of the largest ride-hailing hubs in the world embracing mobility solutions for a sustainable urban future,” said Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of BMW AG’s board of management, in a statement. ReachNow trips appear to be pricier than those on Didi’s “luxury” feature — which is currently only available in China’s top-tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou — that also deploys BMW Series 5 and the likes of Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6. A 23-kilometer ride in Chengdu, for instance, costs 468 yuan or $68 at 3 p.m. on Monday. That’s about $3 per kilometer. By comparison, a trip of similar distance in Shenzhen via Didi Luxury costs 210 yuan, or $30, at a rate of $1.3 per kilometer on a Monday afternoon. BMW’s new move comes shortly after it became the first global carmaker to nab China’s ride-hailing operating license in late November and at a time when the country’s biggest player Didi faces public and government backlashes following two passenger murders. Following the Didi incidents, Chinese authorities have applied deeper controls over the verification process in both drivers and their vehicles to step up safety for riders, leading to a shortage in both drivers and vehicles for Didi and its ride-hailing peers. China’s transportation rules stipulate that drivers must hold two certificates — one for themselves and one for their vehicles — to be eligible to take passenger requests on ride-hailing apps. That turned a lot of part-time drivers away as they either don’t want to invest the time and money preparing for exams or scrap their passenger cars after eight years. To cope with regulatory changes, Didi has introduced training programs to help drivers obtain the desired licenses. The mobility giant has also partnered with carmakers to make “purpose-built” vehicles for on-demand rides, although that process had started before the passenger deaths. Like BMW, China’s oldfashioned carmakers also have their sights set on the car-hailing market. Among them are Volkswagen’s local partner SAIC Motor and Geely, which is partnering with Daimler to roll out a new ride-hailing venture.","BMW has joined a handful of automakers to compete with transportation upstart Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s Chinese business in 2016.

Henry Pickavet,"Ride-hailing, social interactions from behind tiny screens and fitness tracking are just a few of the things we’ve all become accustomed to thanks to innovative app-makers. It’s not often that we think of tech serving society for good. But it’s time we do. Promise, mRelief, Pigeon.ly and Concrn are four companies that, from the start, set out to have a positive impact on society. The heads of these startups have identified issues that plague society and that few people take the time to consider. Bail reform, easier access to food stamps, communication with incarcerated individuals and helping people in need are not sexy issues. But you can utilize tech to try to fix them, and you can hear all about it at Disrupt SF. The issue of bail reform has gained traction in recent years and has been espoused by the likes of California Senator Kamala Harris and Rand Paul, as well as civil liberties groups. That’s because 62 percent of the jail population is behind bars because they can’t afford bail. The premise of Promise is that it serves as a cheaper alternative to incarceration by partnering with counties to monitor the whereabouts of low-risk offenders via an app, rather than keeping them locked up until trial. “People are going to jail because they look at a piece of paper and misread it, or are going to jail because they can’t afford a class because they’re instead paying child support,” Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Promise co-founder, told TechCrunch in March when the company raised a $3 million round led by First Round Capital, with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation participating. Like Promise, mRelief is a service that partners with government. The company’s platform is designed to help cut through bureaucratic tape that can prevent people from accessing important services. Either using a web app or text messaging, users can determine their eligibility to receive food stamp services. Recent updates to the platform now let users in certain locations to go through the entire application process using the web or SMS platform. “Our mission has long been to restore dignity by transforming access to social services,” Rose Afriyie, mRelief co-founder and executive director, told TechCrunch earlier this year. The company has helped more than 230,000 families since launching out of Y Combinator in 2016. Incarcerated individuals are already cut off from society, and when calling friends and family is too cost-prohibitive, it intensifies the isolation. Frederick Hutson, CEO of Pigeon.ly, started the company to help minimize those costs. Hutson, who served four years in prison for drug trafficking, knows all too well the burden this creates. Since the company was founded in 2012, its services have expanded beyond voice. It also allows users to connect to their inmates with photos and letters. In San Francisco, there is an app that allows users to help people in need. Currently available only in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, Concrn was designed to provide an alternative to calling emergency services. If a user sees someone in emotional or behavioral crisis, they can use the app to report it to a trained Concrn Responder. This helps to alleviate stress on the 911 system and prevents people from unwillingly going into the medical system. “Our focus has been to create economic opportunities for people in the Tenderloin community who have previously been marginalized or unable to access employment and also people who have experienced their own mental health crisis in the past,” Neil Shah, Concrn co-executive director, told TechCrunch last year. Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Rose Afriyie, Frederick Hutson and Neil Shah will be on the Disrupt SF stage in just a few weeks to talk about using technology to effect change in a society that badly needs it. The full agenda is here.

Antonio Villas-Boas,"It seems that some issues with the Apple Watch Series 2— where some users complained of swelling batteries and screens that pop off — could have made it to some 2017 models of the more recent Apple Watch Series 3. 
 New Jersey resident Gina Priano-Keyser has filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Apple, seeking damages over claims that the screen of her Apple Watch Series 3 detached off the watch's main body and cracked. The filing says that Priano-Keyser's daughter tried to push the screen back into place, but the Apple Watch has reportedly been ""unusable"" ever since, according to MacRumors, which first reported on the lawsuit. 
 That's a similar problem to one that some Apple Watch Series 2 owners faced. In April 2018, Apple offered free repairs on defective Apple Watch Series 2 models for up to three years. But Priano-Kayser claims that Apple denied an in-warranty repair for her Apple Watch Series 3 in August 2018, and was quoted an out-of-warranty cost of $229 to fix it. 
 And so, Priano-Keyser engaged the services of the Shepherd, Finkelman, Miller &amp; Shah, LLP law firm to sue Apple, claiming that all models of Apple Watch are affected by a manufacturing flaw that causes the battery to swell. 
 The proposed class-action lawsuit alleges that all versions of the Apple Watch so far can have screens that pop off or crack because of ""aging or otherwise faulty li-on batteries, or by defective internal components of the Watches that regulate temperature, electrical currents, charging, and other mechanisms that could affect the Watches' li-on batteries."" 
 The suit also alleges that all Apple Watch generations ""contain the same defect and/or flaw, specifically, swelling lithium-ion (or ""li-on"") batteries, which in turn cause Apple Watch screens to crack, shatter, or detach from the body of the Watch (the ""Defect""), through no fault of the wearer, oftentimes only days or weeks after purchase."" 
 The filing further claims that Apple ""either knew, or should have known, that the Watches contain the Defect and are not fit for their intended purpose."" 
 The class-action lawsuit proposal cites over a dozen similar complaints that users submitted in Apple's support forums. Still, it's not clear just how many users might actually be affected by similar problems with their Apple Watch Series 3. 
 Business Insider reached out to Apple and Shepherd, Finkelman, Miller &amp; Shah, LLP for comment and will update if we hear back.",Apple is being sued over allegations of a defect in the Apple Watch Series 3 that causes the battery to swell and the screen to potentially pop off the watch's main body or crack.

Roberto Baldwin,"""The idea is that we really have to develop a car today on a highly sophisticated level."" We're sitting in the automaker's latest research center built specifically for that highly sophisticated car. Or in BMW's case, two cars. One is the all-electric level 3 iNext that will be sold to the public. On the highway, the car should be able to drive itself under set circumstances. The other is a fleet vehicle with level 4 (and potentially level 5) capabilities that will be part of BMW's upcoming branded ride-hailing service. The automaker plans on delivering both of these vehicles in 2021. BMW has been erring on the side of caution when it comes to autonomy (I'm reminded of this multiple times while in Munich). Who can blame them with the recent Uber tragedy and Tesla Model S accident ? It's important to remember that cars are not phones or laptops or even electric push scooters. Sure the technology inside automobiles is advancing far quicker than ever, but automakers still have to produce software and hardware solutions that appease regulators and, more importantly, keep drivers safe. When a smartphone freezes up, you just restart it. When a car freezes up at 80 miles an hour on the freeway, it's suddenly an uncontrollable death machine. So whatever resources BMW wants to throw at autonomous car research are welcome. But making sure the automaker's 2021 plans (and beyond) come to fruition means it's decided to go all in on self-driving research. With that in mind, BMW opened its Autonomous Driving Campus near its headquarters in Munich, Germany, this week. The facility's 23,000 square meters (5.6 acres) will eventually accommodate 1,800 employees and 500 vehicles. While I attended the grand opening of the campus (that's still under construction), there are already employees at the site working. During a tour of one of the completed buildings, the automaker showed off how it plans to achieve autonomy in the future and change the way it works. Instead of a single team working on an entire system, sub-tasks (features of a system) are assigned to various departments to tackle problems in a fast-paced environment. BMW compared it to how startups work and touted how agile this will allow them to be. The automaker noted that since deploying its test fleet in California, it has racked up 24 million kilometers (14.9 million miles) in data. But 95 percent of those miles were tested in a proprietary BMW simulator using data from its test cars, Pegasus the open-source scenario database, and a scenario editor. The result is something that looks like a video game where researchers fine-tune edge case situations to see how BMW's AI reacts to certain events. Other companies like Mercedes, GM and Waymo also use simulators to test and train their AI. It's become an important part of the research. It's nearly impossible to encounter every situation while driving test vehicles. It's completely impossible to recreate and slightly tweak those situations to account for changing weather and road conditions and the presence of more (or fewer) vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. Of course, all the car data has to come from somewhere. During a sensor demonstration, BMW shared a new solid-state LiDAR system that it says has double the range and 2.5 times the resolution of what's currently on the road today. On its test vehicles, laser-based sensors are placed in the front center and sides and rear. The result should be a higher-quality image of a car's surrounding area than what we've seen in the past. Typically a sensor helps parse the objects it detects and passes it on to the vehicle's computer. BMW has decided to use the raw data directly from the cameras, LiDAR, radar, etc, combine it and do its own object detection. So instead of three pieces of hardware telling a computer if they see a person, the internal CPU uses the combined raw data to ""see"" a pedestrian. BMW also believes mapping is part of that data-gathering package. ""It's very important. We see it as a different sensor. With our onboard sensors, we are creating a live map of just what's happening around the car and we have a live map coming from Here,"" Dr. Wisselmann told Engadget. The live information and saved map data are overlaid to make sure the car is where it says it is. Nokia's Here maps was acquired by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015. Mercedes uses it to for Active Distance Assist Distronic on the new S-Class to slow a car down if the map determines an upcoming corner is too sharp for the car's current speed. BMW's iNext won't be the first level 3 car available for purchase. That distinction goes to Audi's 2019 A8. Unfortunately, there are regulatory issues that determine when and where the technology can be deployed. BMW is hoping by 2021 countries (and states) will have figured out how to accept vehicles like the iNext and A8. Meanwhile, the automaker is determining how to actually navigate the autonomous future. The new Autonomous Driving Campus is not just a solid step in the right direction, it's a huge leap both financially and in how it builds cars generally. If an automaker isn't working on this issue, it risks being left behind. BMW wants to make sure it does this right. It wants to be cautious. Seriously, they told me that over and over again. But that's important. Not just for the automaker but for the entire industry. Being careful about introducing these types of features keeps drivers safe and cars out of headlines. BMW is known for fast cars. But fast doesn't necessarily mean unsafe and a giant facility dedicated to making sure its first self-driving cars are conservative on the roads is a good thing.","Dr. Dirk Wisselmann, senior expert for autonomous driving at BMW, tells me that the automaker's first level 3 car will have the technical capabilities for level 4 or 5 highway driving.

Alex Macheras 20-year-old Alex Macheras is a broadcast aviation analyst who flies around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even available to the public. He flew on the delivery flight for the Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft on December 13. Says Singapore Airlines' A380 first class suite is the ""hands down winner"" of all the competitors — including Emirates — for several reasons. Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. As a broadcast aviation analyst, he spends his time jet setting around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even open to the public. Last week he took an empty flight from the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France to Changi Airport in Singapore for the delivery of Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft, and shared his experience via his Instagram. Here he is being greeted by the cabin crew ahead of the 13-hour flight. Macheras told Business Insider that on these kinds of trips he spends the duration of the journey examining every aspect of the plane's cabins. ""I'm usually on my hands and knees in the suites testing out what it's like to work on the dining table, use the blinds, dim the lights, etc.,"" he said. His experience sounds similar to YouTube star Casey Neistat's when he took a trip in one of Emirates' newly-launched first class suites its Boeing 777 aircraft. After checking out all of the private cabin's features, Neistat called it the ""all-time greatest airplane seat."" However, Macheras, who has experienced the first class offerings from the likes of Emirates, Etihad, and Cathay Pacific, said there were a number of things about Singapore Airlines' new private suite that make it the ""hands down winner."" Here are the six reasons Singapore Airlines wins, according to Macheras. 1. The bed and seat are separate The core reason Singapore Airlines' A380 first class cabin is ""miles ahead of Emirates'"" is its concept, Macheras said. ""These days 99% of business class cabins feature a big seat that reclines into a fully flat bed — it's so common nowadays — but this suite has a seat and a bed,"" he explained. Alex Machers 2. It's more spacious than a 'central London apartment' The second reason is the space, he said. ""When we talk about spacious cabins in first class, it's usually about how much movement you have in your seat. ""With Emirates first class, it's a small area that is taken up pretty much by the seat, so you can just stand on the spot, but in the Singapore suite there was space to walk around. I'm known for my pacing on the phone — in fact I'm doing it right now — and I found myself pacing during the flight at 43,000 feet."" ""People have tweeted me saying it looks bigger than their central London apartment,"" he added. Alex Macheras 3. It has an understated, elegant style ""With all these airlines offering beds in their first class cabins, they have to differentiate themselves from competitors through the small details and quirks,"" Macheras said. ""Emirates is known for its glitziness and sparkly gold products, whereas Singapore is understated and elegant. It's low-lit like a boutique hotel, which appeals to many more people than the wild lights show of Emirates."" 4. The amenity kits are luxurious Luxury French brand Lalique has designed the new amenity kits as well as the pajamas and bedding for the first class suites. ""The new amenity kits were another thing that impressed me,"" Macheras said. ""But this isn’t just a plush blanket, it’s white crisp Lalique bedsheets that you might expect in a hotel room. The amenity kits are packed with Lalique fragrances, creams, balms, moisturisers, and even a scented candle. 5. The seat has a 'swivel' mechanism so you can face the window Alex Macheras The plush armchair featured in the Singapore Airlines' suite has an electronic swivel mechanism that means you can face any direction you want. ""What's the bonus in having this function? It's something I hadn't considered before I took this flight, but when you fly as much as I do, you've often seen all of the movies on offer,"" he said. Being able to reposition your seat means that you can soak up the views while aboard, he explained. ""When we flew over the Middle East it was 6 p.m. on the ground and the sun was setting and I caught this impressive sunset with so many different tones of orange,"" he said. ""I could just relax and watch it with my headphones in, without getting neck ache."" It also just so happened to be the peak of the Geminid meteor shower while he was on the flight, so while flying over Iran the aircraft was surrounded by shooting stars. ""In the space of about four minutes, I saw about 10 shooting stars,"" he said. 6. There's a 32-inch flat screen TV ""Finally, there's a 32-inch flat screen mounted on the wall of the suite, which is controlled by the tablet and can move left or right — it's like being in someone's living room.""

CHARLIE SAVAGE,"Fred Korematsu, an American citizen living on the West Coast, refused to leave and was convicted of disobeying a military order. With help from the American Civil Liberties Union, he appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court. But the court voted, 6-3, to uphold the internment policy as a justified national-security measure amid the wartime emergency. Years later, as World War II receded and the civil-rights movement unfolded, that policy — and the Supreme Court ruling upholding it — became widely seen as wrong. In 1982, a congressional commission called the policy a “grave injustice” that stemmed from “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.” In a concurrence, the government said “the decision in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history.” In 1988, Congress passed a law, signed by President Ronald Reagan, providing $20,000 in reparations to each surviving detainee. A dozen years later, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia invoked Korematsu as one of the most notorious mistakes of the court, alongside the Dred Scott decision, the pre-Civil War case denying freedom and citizenship to black slaves brought into free states. A district court judge vacated Mr. Korematsu’s conviction in 1984, citing in part the discovery that the Roosevelt-era Justice Department had misled the judiciary about the need for the policy, including by citing claims that Japanese-Americans were signaling offshore submarines that the executive branch had already decided were probably not true. But because the government did not try again to detain entire categories of people in a protected class like race or religion, no case presented a good vehicle for the Supreme Court to overturn the precedent. The travel ban case, however, brought Korematsu back to the forefront. It traced back to Mr. Trump’s campaign proposal in 2015 to categorically bar Muslims from entering the United States. At the time, Mr. Trump cited with approval Roosevelt’s actions, including wartime restrictions placed on Americans of Japanese, German and Italian ancestry, and said he was not going that far. “Take a look at what F.D.R. did many years ago,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “He did the same thing.”","A Japanese internment camp in Manzanar, Calif., in 1942.

Victoria Song,"Despite what wearables makers would have you think, its not just all smartwatches. Theres still a place for the humble fitness tracker. For starters, theyre much cheaper than smartwatches, provide accurate fitness tracking, have better battery life, and are perfectly adequate at delivering push notifications. This basically sums up Fitbits new flagship fitness trackers, the Inspire and Inspire HR.
At $100, the Inspire HR is literally a quarter of the price of an Apple Watch Series 4. The Inspire, which omits the heart rate monitoring, is even cheaper at $70. Similar non-Fitbit fitness trackers, like Garmins Vivosmart 4, are still more expensive at $130. So from an affordability standpoint, Fitbits Inspire line is definitely worth a closer examination. After all, if it cant deliver the same performance customers have come to expect from Fitbits, what good is the lower price?

Boring design. Doesn't stand out.
I spent a week with the Inspire HR, and so far, its been a mixed bag. Functionally, I dont have much to complain about. It tracks my steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutesjust like any fitness tracker worth its salt does in 2019. I get continuous heart rate monitoring, and I can confirm that youll get at least five days of battery life off one charge. Its water resistant to 50 meters or 5ATM, which is generally the standard needed to be considered swimproofand yes, the Inspire HR survived multiple showers and run-ins with my dishes.
As for accuracy, the Inspire HR delivers a solid performance. On a one-mile treadmill walk at 3.5 miles per hourthe average walking speedit logged 2,100 steps to my control pedometers 2,139 steps for an excellent difference of 1.8 percent. It did equally well on a one-mile run at 5 mph, registering 1,924 steps to the control pedometers 1,992 steps. Thats a decent difference of 3 percent. Heart rate tracking was also on point, falling within 2 beats per minute of an Apple Watch Series 4 during exercise, and within 10 bpm of my Polar H10 chest strap. (Chest straps deliver more accurate readings than wrist-based optical monitors, as theyre actually sending an electric signal to your heart.)
Automatic exercise tracking is also decent. I wore the Inspire HR to a groovy dancehall class, and while it tracked my 90 minutes of rhythmically challenged flopping around as a sport I was pleased it marked the exercise at all. Often times, Ill wear a Series 4 to the same class and despite sweating my butt off, it wont register as exercise.
So if battery life is great, accuracy is on-point, and the price is super, shouldnt this be the fitness tracker to end all fitness trackers? It might have been, if not for the design.
The Inspire HRs design is disappointing. It copies the slim and sleek shape of Fitbits popular Alta trackers, and normally, Id consider that a good thing. However, on my wrist, the Inspire HR just looks cheap. Gone is the Altas anodized aluminum bodywhat you get now is black plastic. Also, the joints where the screen meets the strap are less angular. While I can appreciate that Fitbit meant to make it a more rounded, modern look, I cant help but feel the design choice makes it look more childish.
Thats not to say the Inspire HR hasnt made any design improvements. The touchscreen is no longer dependent on taps, which was one of the major annoyances with the Alta. The monochrome screen is now swipe-based, as in you swipe down to access a quick menu to exercises, and up to view your daily stats. Still, Fitbit hasnt managed to figure out how to reduce bezels and the Inspire HR has incredibly thick ones the width of my pinky finger at the top and bottom.
Also different is the mechanism for swapping bands. The Alta had a handy latch that made switching straps super intuitive and easy. The Inspire HR has opted for the same pin system as the Versa. Its not hard per se, but it is cumbersome and for me, makes me disinclined to ever swap out straps.
You can, however, opt to do away with straps entirely and plop the tracker into a clip accessory, which used to be the purview of Fitbits cheapest trackers. Thats because with the Inspire and Inspire HR, Fitbit is obliterating its entire lower-end product offering. The Inspire trackers will effectively replace the Fitbit Zip, One, Flex 2, Alta, and Alta HRmeaning your only other options in the Fitbit family will be its series of smartwatches and the Fitbit Charge 3.
Thats smart business, but wearing the Inspire HR, I cant help but mourn the Alta HR. Before the Versa, the Alta HR was the Fitbit I most commonly recommended to casual wearables users. Not only was it stylish and discreet, it also wasnt horribly priced and it delivered accurate tracking metrics. Other trackers followed suit, and you can definitely notice the Alta HRs design influence on Garmins Vivosmart 4.
It might seem petty to whine about the Inspire HRs looks, especially since functionally its not really a compromise or step down from the Alta HR. But design is a big part of whether you actually stick with a wearable in the long run, or if simply collects dust at the bottom of your drawer. Im pretty sure no one is going to compliment me on the Inspire HR unless I opt for a nicer accessory. Meanwhile, Ive gotten plenty of compliments while wearing the Alta HR and Versa. Sure, its extremely vain, but it is a motivating factor keep your tracker charged and on your wrist. In that sense, the Inspire HR feels like a blatant corporate cash grab, which is a stinking shame.
All this makes Fitbits Charge 3 a much more attractive option for a simple fitness tracker. Its only $50 more, but you get about seven days of battery lifeand yes, an extra two days does make a differenceplus all the same tracking features, and some smartwatch-esque functionality via apps. Theres a bigger touchscreen, haptic feedback, and its just a classier looking device. Likewise, Garmins aforementioned vivosmart 4 is also a solid alternative. Its $30 more, and you give up the ability to switch out straps, but it actually makes use of its Sp02 sensors and Garmins entire software platform is better suited to anyone who really wants to get into their data. (Fitbits platform is much more palatable to anyone who wants a more streamlined view.)
But really, the Inspire HRs lackluster design and failure to truly differentiate itself from the Charge 3 just makes me wonder: Why bother at all? After all, Fitbit just released its Versa Lite Edition which gets you all basic powers of its smartwatch ecosystem, for just $60 more than the Inspire HR.
If this sounds harsh, it admittedly may be. It is admirable that Fitbit managed to figure out a sub-$100 tracker, especially since it performs quite well. But naming your tracker Inspire ought to evoke that feeling in some formand it just doesnt.
README:
Lots of great features and accurate tracking, especially for a sub $100 tracker!
The design just seems chintzier than predecessors like the Alta HR, and newer options like the Versa Lite Edition.
Doesnt distinguish itself from Fitbits other flagship tracker, the Charge 3.","Despite what wearables makers would have you think, it’s not just all smartwatches.

Associated Press,"Tesla's Model 3 has earned a recommendation from Consumer Reports. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider A wireless update of antilock braking software improved the stopping distance of Tesla's electric Model 3, prompting Consumer Reports to reverse course and give the car its ""Recommended Buy"" rating. The magazine said Wednesday that the update cut 19 feet off the car's stopping distance from 60 miles per hour. A previous test — the results of which were released a little more than a week ago — found that it took 152 feet for the Model S compact car to stop from 60, the longest braking distance of any modern car the magazine has tested. The improved braking raised the car's score high enough for it to receive the coveted recommendation. But Consumer Reports still has concerns over wind noise, a stiff ride, and the touch-screen controls that could distract a driver. After the first round of testing was made public, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to fix the problem within days. Consumer Reports says it was told by Tesla that the software helps the brakes adapt to variations in how they are used and how they respond in different environmental conditions. On Twitter Wednesday, Musk wrote that he appreciates the ""high-quality critical feedback"" from Consumer Reports and said that noise and ride comfort already had been addressed. Another software update will address the controls, he wrote, without elaborating. Musk told the magazine last week that Tesla had already made production changes to address wind noise, the harsh ride and an uncomfortable rear seat, Consumer Reports said in a statement. Consumer Reports said it will rent another Model 3 from Tesla to check on the changes and will report back on the results. The magazine bought a Model 3 for the first test and said it doesn't normally rent test vehicles. The Model 3 is Tesla's first attempt to appeal to mass-market buyers. The car that starts at $35,000 but can run as high as $78,000 has been plagued by production delays. Tesla's software update was done either via the car's cellular connection or a wireless internet link, depending on how the owner configures the car, according to Tesla. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, said that in 19 years of work for the magazine he has not seen a car's track performance improve with a wireless update. Musk pledged in a tweet last week that the braking improvements would make the Model 3 best in its class. But Consumer Reports said the stopping distance was not class leading and the further updates may be necessary. The magazine also said nearly all of the Model 3's controls are on a center touchscreen direction with no gauges on the dashboard and few buttons inside the car. This forces drivers to take several steps to do simple tasks and can cause driver distraction, the magazine said. Consumer Reports also said it got a record 350 miles of range per charge with a long-range version of the Model 3 when it's set on a high mode to recharge batteries with energy from braking.","Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The Tesla Model 3 has earned Consumer Reports ' ""Recommended Buy"" rating after an over-the-air software update improved the car's braking performance.

Sarah Perez,"Caspar Health, a startup launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, wants to make access to rehabilitative care easier and more accessible. The digital platform allows doctors to assign customizable therapy treatment plans to patients following an injury, surgery or other medical event, like a stroke, which patients can then access using an app on their mobile device. The company was founded two years ago by longtime friends Maximilian Michels, and serial entrepreneurs Benjamin Pochhammer and Maximilian von Waldenfels, who sold their last company Food Express to Takeaway.com. Michels, who has a background in healthcare, came up with the idea for Caspar Health because he saw a need to make first-class healthcare something that’s available to anyone – even if limited by geography or a lack of therapy providers in the patient’s area. “He realized, via a research study [the hospital he managed] did with a large reimbursement stakeholder, that the way rehabilitation has been conducted is still very ineffective, and there’s no digital component integrated into the patient treatment procedure,” von Waldenfels explains. To use the system, a doctor or therapist would log on to the platform after seeing the patient and confirming their diagnosis. For example, they may want to assign specific treatments or therapies for someone recovering from knee surgery, back pain or a heart attack. After entering the patient’s information and medical condition, Caspar Health automatically generates a treatment plan for the patient, which the doctor can then optionally customize to meet the patient’s needs. These treatment plans are created in-house and offer everything from instructional videos (e.g. physical therapy/exercises, tutorials on how to use crutches, etc.), to information on the illness or injury itself. Patients can read the information and watch videos from a mobile application that runs on their phone or tablet, and give feedback about how the exercise or other therapy went to allow doctors to adjust the plans accordingly. At launch, there are some 1,000 videos available and the system is in use in 64 hospitals across Germany, including a couple of the largest hospital groups. This makes Caspar Health accessible by over 100,000 potential patients. So far, 6,500 have signed up. Caspar Health is sold as an enterprise software-as-a-service subscription, where facilities pay a monthly subscription fee as well as a fee per patient. Notably, Caspar Health’s treatments are reimbursed by the largest reimbursement stakeholders, meaning the medical facilities are receiving the same amount of money per session as a face-to-face treatment. The larger goal is to make Caspar Health available to other markets outside Germany, especially those where there’s a large population that doesn’t have access to therapists and doctors for their condition, or who can’t afford in-office visits. Today, Caspar Health is also launching internationally, and is available in four languages: English, German, Mandarin, and Cantonese. The startup is backed by 3 million euro in seed funding from Atlantic Labs (Christophe Maire), Think.Health, and other family offices.","Caspar Health, a startup launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, wants to make access to rehabilitative care easier and more accessible.

Paulina Dedaj,"Authorities in New York arrested a 14-year-old boy on Friday for allegedly vandalizing the memorial of a slain Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor recipient. Suffolk County Police received a call on Thursday that the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Park in Lake Ronkonkoma had been “vandalized.” A picture released by police on Facebook showed that a granite stone with an image of the fallen soldier had been shattered. By 3 a.m. Friday, detectives had arrested the unidentified teen in his home. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took to Twitter earlier to say he was “appalled and disgusted” and promise that the state would pay for the replacement of the defaced plaque. The park, where Murphy was once a lifeguard, was dedicated to him in 2009, on what would have been his 30 th birthday. Murphy was killed while conducting “a reconnaissance mission” in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. He and other members of his SEAL team were “scouting” a well-known terrorist when they were ambushed by an enemy force 50-strong.

Patton, of Boulder City, Nev.; and Lt. Michael P. Murphy, of Patchogue, N.Y. With the exception of Luttrell, all were killed June 28, 2005, by enemy forces while supporting Operation Red Wing. (Navy) “Despite the intensity of the firefight and suffering grave gunshot wounds himself, Murphy is credited with risking his own life to save the lives of his teammates,” his Summary of Action read. After two hours of fighting, Murphy, Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class (SEAL) Danny Dietz and Sonar Technician 2nd Class (SEAL) Matthew Axelson were dead. Navy file photo of SEAL Lt. Michael P. Murphy, from Patchogue, N.Y., and sonar technician (surface) Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew G. Axelson, of Cupertino, Calif., taken in Afghanistan. Both were assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Murphy and Axelson were killed by enemy forces during a reconnaissance mission, Operation Red Wing, June 28, 2005. They were part of a four-man team tasked with finding a key Taliban leader in the mountainous terrain near Asadabad, Afghanistan, when they came under fire from a much larger enemy force with superior tactical position. (Navy) “By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting spirit and inspirational devotion to his men in the face of certain death, Lieutenant Murphy was able to relay the position of his unit, an act that ultimately led to the rescue of Luttrell and the recovery of the remains of the three who were killed in the battle.” Marcus Luttrell, the only surviving member of the team, took to Instagram to shame the “coward” that had vandalized the memorial. The suspect was charged with second-degree criminal mischief, and was scheduled to be arraigned in family court at a later date, Fox 5 reported. Paulina Dedaj is a writer/ reporter for Fox News.

"Gillan Ropero, ABS-CBN News","MANILA - Almost half of Filipinos expect President Rodrigo Duterte to deliver most, if not all, of his promises during his term, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey revealed Friday.
Of 1,440 adult Filipinos polled last month, 48 percent said Duterte could ""fulfill most, if not all, of his promises.""
Of this number, 13 percent said they believe Duterte could fulfill all of his promises, while 35 percent said he could make most of his promises happen.
The survey, meanwhile, found 6 percent saying Duterte could not fulfill his promises, while the remaining 46 percent said he could fulfill ""a few"" of his promises.
Optimism that Duterte can fulfill his promises was highest in his home region Mindanao at 50 percent despite a 10-point drop, followed by Balance Luzon at 49 percent, Visayas at 46 percent, and Metro Manila at 41 percent.
Expectations on the President rose in class E by 18 points to 52 percent, and by 7 points in class ABC to 56 percent. It, however, fell by 3 points in class D to 46 percent.
The fourth quarter poll was conducted from December 16 to 19, 2018. It has a margin of error of ±2.6 percent for national figures.
Among Duterte's promises when he was campaigning was ridding the country of illegal drugs in just 3 to 6 months, which he has since said turned out to be a ""fiasco.""
The President also vowed to end the practice of ""endo"" among workers. In May 2018, he signed Executive Order 51 stopping illegal contractualization.
Duterte also promised to pursue peace efforts with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and establish a Bangsamoro region in order to grant wider self-rule to predominantly Muslim provinces and cities. The Bangsamoro plebiscite will be held on January 21.

"Asbury Park Press, Kevin Davis, Asbury Park Press","After pleading guilty to having sex with three underage teenagers and sending lewd messages, a substitute teacher in Louisiana was spared jail and could even be headed back to the classroom, New Orlean's station WDSU reports. 
As part of a plea deal, 34-year-old Heidi Domangue Verrett pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of carnal knowledge of a juvenile and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. When she was arrested in 2016, the Terrebonne Parish instructor faced three felony charges, according to the report.
A district judge then suspended Verretts six-month jail term and sentenced the substitute teacher and teachers aide to two years of unsupervised probation and ordered her to pay $900 in fines, Houma Today reports. She did not have to register as a sex offender.
The deal also prohibits Verrett from teaching for two years. However, prosecutors told WDSU it's unlikely she'll be instructing students for the rest of her life because a background check would reveal the conviction.

http://www.facebook.com/fox2now,"An Illinois man accused of harassing a woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt at a Chicago-area park was charged Thursday with state hate crimes, authorities said. Prosecutors filed the two Class 3 felony hate crime charges against Timothy G. Trybus, Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Trybus could face up to five years in prison for each of the hate crime charges. He has a bail hearing Friday afternoon in Skokie. He also faces separate charges of assault and disorderly conduct after a June 14 incident involving Mia Irizarry that was recorded on video. He will go to court August 1 to face those charges. Trybus will be represented by a public defender, but one has not been assigned to him yet, the public defender’s office said. CNN has attempted to reach Trybus for comment. Officer resigns A parks officer has resigned after being criticized for not intervening during the June 14 incident. which was caught on video at a northwestern Chicago park. In it Irizarry pleads for help as a man harasses her, saying her shirt is un-American. The officer initially appears to ignore the pleas. Irizarry said she was celebrating her 24th birthday at Caldwell Woods park when the man approached her and asked her why she was wearing the sleeveless Puerto Rico flag shirt. It also had “Puerto Rico” written below the neckline. Irizarry recorded the encounter on her phone, saying she felt threatened, and posted the video to Facebook. On Monday, Forest Preserves of Cook County, which administers the park, tweeted that it was aware of the incident and video and that it had launched an investigation. The Cook County Forest Preserve District police officer, Patrick Conner, resigned Wednesday, and the investigation into the incident continues, the agency said. An attorney for the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council, which is representing Conner, said that the video “does not look good,” but cautioned that the video may not tell the whole story. “We don’t know what was happening outside the video; we don’t know what was going on inside his (Conner’s) head at the time,” the attorney, Tamara Cummings, said Thursday. “He was looking forward to an opportunity to explain what was happening. However, given the media attention and pressure, he decided to resign.” “Given his decision to resign, he won’t be offering any additional comment on what might have happened during this situation,” she said. “He’s very distraught and not happy about having to leave employment much sooner than he intended, but because of the strong reaction from the public and political figures, he thought it would be unrealistic to stay as an officer.” The preserve district police chief, Kelvin Pope, said he didn’t know why Conner apparently didn’t step in initially. Pope said Conner feels “he wasn’t given a fair shake,” and that “he was very remorseful.” But Conner resigned before investigators could ask him what happened during a disciplinary hearing, Pope said at a news conference Thursday. “(Conner’s) personnel file will reflect that this officer did not resign in good standing, with a note indicating that he left the district with discipline pending,” the park agency’s general superintendent, Arnold Randall, said. Call for hate crime charges Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” García had called for hate crimes charges against Trybus. “A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient,” García said. “We cannot allow that ugly rhetoric to be the norm in Cook County.” Randall, the forest preserves superintendent, said his agency has apologized to Irizarry and refunded the money she had paid for a permit to gather at a picnic table area on the day of the incident. He said his agency would re-examine the diversity training for its officers and other employees. “It’s up to each and every one of us to present a better model to demonstrate with our own actions how to treat each other with more respect,” he told reporters Thursday. “We might start with the fine example presented by Mia Irizarry and her family, who handled this ugly incident with great composure, never stooping to the level of the man who attacked her.” The incident In the footage, a man can be seen approaching Irizarry saying: “You should not be wearing that in the United States of America.” He gets closer to her and asks “Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?” Irizarry says Puerto Rico is part of the United States and the man approaches her multiple times. She asks a park police officer to help, saying, “I am renting this area and he’s harassing me about the shirt that I’m wearing.” Later she says: “Officer, I feel entirely uncomfortable, can you remove … please officer” as the officer is seen walking away from her. Then she says: “Officer, I’m renting, I paid for a permit for this area. I do not feel comfortable with him here, is there anything you can do?” The officer can then be seen talking to the man who gesticulates back and tells him to “shut the f*** up.” More police arrive and Irizarry says she still doesn’t feel safe. The man resumes his abuse, saying: “You’re not American, if you were American you wouldn’t wear that. You know that right?” A female officer asks to see his ID and can be heard telling him that he’s intoxicated, to which he replies, “Well that’s your judgment.” She explains that Irizarry has a permit and she warns him that he could be arrested “for not being compliant.” “You don’t come here harassing people,” the officer continues. “People have just as much right to be here as you and when you’re drunk, you don’t belong here.” The female officer then speaks with Irizarry, who gives her version of the incident and the officer explains that they were called to the area after a report that a man was choking a woman. Eventually, the first officer on the scene takes notes of Irizarry’s account of the incident and says that he was at the scene due to the separate incident, noting that she was not being attacked though acknowledging she felt threatened. Irizarry can be heard explaining to the officer that the incident began when they had asked the group the man was in if they could move as they had a permit for the area. She said the group politely complied but her Puerto Rico shirt appeared to act as a trigger to the man. Puerto Rico is a US commonwealth with its own constitution. Puerto Rican residents have been American citizens since 1917 and have the right to vote in US presidential primaries, but not in presidential elections.

In this article, you can learn how to build the animated note display from the Awwwards website. It discusses the HTML5 SVG circle element, its stroke properties, and how to animate them with CSS variables and Vanilla JavaScript.
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is a standard XML-based markup language for vector graphics. It allows you to draw paths, curves, and shapes by determining a set of points in the 2D plane. Moreover, you can add twitch properties on those paths (such as stroke, color, thickness, fill, and more) in order to produce animations.
Since April 2017, CSS Level 3 Fill and Stroke Module allow SVG colors and fill patterns to be set from an external stylesheet, instead of setting attributes on each element. In this tutorial, we will use a simple plain hex color, but both fill and stroke properties also accept patterns, gradients and images as values.
Note: When visiting the Awwwards website, the animated note display can only be viewed with browser width set to 1024px or more.
A demo of the final result (Large preview)
File Structure
Lets start by creating the files in the terminal:
 mkdir note-display
 cd note-display
 touch index.html styles.css scripts.js
HTML
Here is the initial template that links both css and js files:
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Note Display&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./styles.css""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;script src=""./scripts.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Each note element consists of a list item: li that holds the circle, the note value, and its label.
List item element and its direct children: .circle, .percent and .label. (Large preview)
The .circle_svg is an SVG element, that wraps two &lt;circle&gt; elements. The first is the path to be filled while the second is the fill that will be animated.
SVG elements. SVG wrapper and circle tags. (Large preview)
The note is separated into integer and decimals so different font sizes can be applied to them. The label is a simple &lt;span&gt;. So, putting all of this together looks like this:
&lt;li class=""note-display""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
The cx and cy attributes define the circles x-axis and y-axis center point. The r attribute defines its radius.
You have probably noticed the underscore/dash pattern in classes names. Thats BEM, which stands for block, element and modifier. It is a methodology that makes your element naming more structured, organized and semantic.
Recommended reading: An Explanation Of BEM And Why You Need It
To finish the template structures, lets wrap the four list items in an unordered list element:
Unordered list wrapper holds four li children (Large preview)
&lt;ul class=""display-container""&gt;

 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Exemplary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You must be asking yourself what the labels Transparent, Reasonable, Usable and Exemplary mean. The more acquainted you get with programming, you will realize that writing code is not only about making the application functional, but also assuring that it will be long-term maintainable and scalable. That is only achieved if your code is easy to change.
The acronym TRUE should help decide if the code you write will be able to accommodate change in the future or not.
So, next time, ask yourself:
Transparent: Are code changes consequences clear?
Reasonable: Is cost benefit worth it?
Usable: Will I be able to reuse it in unexpected scenarios?
Exemplary: Does it present high quality as an example for future code?
Note: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz explains TRUE along with other principles and how to achieve those through design patterns. If you havent taken some time to study design patterns yet, consider adding this book to your bedtime reading.
CSS
Lets import the fonts and apply a reset to all items:
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Raleway:200');
* {
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 box-sizing: border-box;
}
The box-sizing: border-box property includes padding and border values into an elements total width and height, so its easier to calculate its dimensions.
Note: For a visual explanation on box-sizing, please read Make Your Life Easier With CSS Box Sizing.
body {
 height: 100vh;
 color: #fff;
 display: flex;
 background: #3E423A;
 font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive;
}
.display-container {
 margin: auto;
 display: flex;
}
By combining the rules display: flex in the body and margin-auto in the .display-container, its possible to center the child element both vertically and horizontally. The .display-container element will also be a flex-container; that way, its children will be placed in the same row along the main axis.
The .note-display list item will also be a flex-container. Since there are many children for centering, lets do it through the justify-content and align-items properties. All flex-items will be centered along the cross and main axis. If youre not sure what those are, check out the alignment section at CSS Flexbox Fundamentals Visual Guide.
.note-display {
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 margin: 0 25px;
}
Lets apply a stroke to the circles by setting the rules stroke-width, stroke-opacity and stroke-linecap that altogether style the stroke live ends. Next, lets add a color to each circle:
.circle__progress {
 fill: none;
 stroke-width: 3;
 stroke-opacity: 0.3;
 stroke-linecap: round;
}
.note-display:nth-child(1) .circle__progress { stroke: #AAFF00; }
.note-display:nth-child(2) .circle__progress { stroke: #FF00AA; }
.note-display:nth-child(3) .circle__progress { stroke: #AA00FF; }
.note-display:nth-child(4) .circle__progress { stroke: #00AAFF; }
In order to position the percent element absolutely, its necessary to know absolutely to what. The .circle element should be the reference, so lets add position: relative to it.
Note: For a deeper, visual explanation on absolute positioning, please read How To Understand CSS Position Absolute Once And For All.
Another way of centering elements is to combine top: 50%, left: 50% and transform: translate(-50%, -50%); which position the elements center at its parents center.
.circle {
 position: relative;
}
.percent {
 width: 100%;
 top: 50%;
 left: 50%;
 position: absolute;
 font-weight: bold;
 text-align: center;
 line-height: 28px;
 transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
.percent__int { font-size: 28px; }
.percent__dec { font-size: 12px; }
.label {
 font-family: 'Raleway', serif;
 font-size: 14px;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 margin-top: 15px;
}
By now, the template should be looking like this:
Finished template elements and styles (Large preview)
Fill Transition
The circle animation can be created with the help of two circle SVG properties: stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset.
stroke-dasharray defines the dash-gap pattern in a stroke.
It can take up to four values:
When its set to an only integer (stroke-dasharray: 10), dashes and gaps have the same size;
For two values (stroke-dasharray: 10 5), the first is applied to dashes, second to gaps;
The third and forth forms (stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 and stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 3) will generate dashes and gaps in various sizes.
stroke-dasharray property values (Large preview)
The image to the left shows the property stroke-dasharray being set from 0 to 238px, which is the circle circumference length.
The second image represents the stroke-dashoffset property that offsets the beginning of the dash array. It is also set from 0 to the circle circumference length.
stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset
 properties (Large preview)
To produce the filling effect, we will set the stroke-dasharray to the circumference length, so that all of its length gets filled with a big dash and no gap. Well also offset it by the same value, so it gets hidden. Then the stroke-dashoffset will be updated to the corresponding note value, filling the stroke accordingly to the transition duration.
The properties updating will be done in the scripts through CSS Variables. Lets declare the variables and set the properties:
.circle__progress--fill {
 --initialStroke: 0;
 --transitionDuration: 0;
 stroke-opacity: 1;
 stroke-dasharray: var(--initialStroke);
 stroke-dashoffset: var(--initialStroke);
 transition: stroke-dashoffset var(--transitionDuration) ease;
}
In order to set the initial value and update the variables, lets start by selecting all .note-display elements with document.querySelectorAll. The transitionDuration will be set to 900 milliseconds.
Then, we iterate through the displays array, select its .circle__progress.circle__progress--fill and extract the r attribute set in the HTML to calculate the circumference length. With that, we can set the initial --dasharray and --dashoffset values.
The animation will occur when the --dashoffset variable gets updated by a 100ms setTimeout:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
 progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = 50, 100);
});
To get the transition starting from the top, the .circle__svg element has to be rotated:
.circle__svg {
 transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
Stroke properties transition (Large preview)
Now, lets calculate the dashoffset value — relative to the note. The note value will be inserted to each li item through the data-* attribute. The * can be switched for any name that suits your needs and it can then, be retrieved in JavaScript through the elements dataset: element.dataset.*.
Note: You can read more about the data-* attribute on MDN Web Docs.
Our attribute will be called data-note:
&lt;ul class=""display-container""&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""7.50""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;

 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;

 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Exemplary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The parseFloat method will convert the string returned by display.dataset.note into a floating point number. The offset represents the percentage missing to reach the maximum score. So, for a 7.50 note, we would have (10 - 7.50) / 10 = 0.25, which means the circumference length should be offset by 25% of its value:
let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
Updating the scripts.js:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
 progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
});
Stroke properties transition up to note value (Large preview)
Before we move on, lets extract the stoke transition to its own method:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
- let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
- let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
- let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
- let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
- progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
- progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
- setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ strokeTransition(display, note);
});
+ function strokeTransition(display, note) {
+ let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
+ let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
+ let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
+ progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
+ progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ }
Note Value Increase
There is still the note transition from 0.00 to the note value to be built. The first thing to do is to separate the integer and decimal values. We will use the string method split() (it takes an argument that determines where the string will be broken and returns an array containing both broken strings). Those will be converted to numbers and passed as arguments to the increaseNumber() function, along with the display element and a flag indicating if its an integer or a decimal.
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let [int, dec] = display.dataset.note.split('.');
+ [int, dec] = [Number(int), Number(dec)];
strokeTransition(display, note);
+ increaseNumber(display, int, 'int');
+ increaseNumber(display, dec, 'dec');
});
In the increaseNumber() function, we select either the .percent__int or .percent__dec element, depending on the className, and also in case the output should contain a decimal point or not. Weve set our transitionDuration to 900ms. Now, to animate a number from 0 to 7, for example, the duration has to be divided by the note 900 / 7 = 128.57ms. The result represents how long each increase iteration will take. This means our setInterval will fire every 128.57ms.
With those variables set, lets define the setInterval. The counter variable will be appended to the element as text and increased on each iteration:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
 element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Infinite counter increase (Large preview)
Cool! It does increase the values, but it kind of does it forever. We need to clear the setInterval when the notes achieve the value we want. That is done with clearInterval function:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
+ if (counter === number) { window.clearInterval(increaseInterval); }
element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Finished project (Large preview)
Now the number is updated up to the note value and cleared with clearInterval() function.

Jonathan Shieber,"What started with an esports team is now quickly becoming an esports empire, backed by some of the biggest names in sports and money managers for entertainment family dynasties and Hollywood power brokers. Vision Esports LP, the esports conglomerate launched by Stratton Sclavos, Rick Fox and Amit Raizada has just closed on a $38 million investment from a host of investors led by the Creative Artists Agency and TPG Growth joint venture Evolution Media. “Evolution Media has spent several years advising and analyzing companies in the esports sector, and we’re particularly excited to partner with a world class management team led by Stratton, whom we’ve known since his days running Strikeforce and the San Jose Sharks,” said Rick Hess, founder and co-managing partner of Evolution Media, in a statement. “Esports is one of the highest growth sectors within all media and entertainment. We couldn’t be more bullish on the space and Vision’s market position.” NBA superstar Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman’s Durant Company also came in to back Vision Esports along with Shamrock Holdings — the personal investment vehicle for the Walt Disney family; the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team; and New York Giants star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. The company’s roots stem from a now-apocryphal trip that Fox, an NBA all-star and actor, took with his son to see an esports game at Madison Square Garden. Fox came away from the game with a respect for competitive gaming and a thirst to get in on the ground floor of something he thought could be the next big thing. With the help of Raizada, the two formed EchoFox and began recruiting a roster of players across a slate of different game titles. Sclavos, the former chief executive of tech company Verisign and the San Jose Sharks, wanted to come down to Los Angeles to start an investment fund. At a dinner with Fox and Raizada, he was recruited into the esports world and launched Vision Esports. “You can’t deny the numbers,” Sclavos says. “It’s like the internet was way back in 95 and 96.” And as the three men looked at what was going on within the burgeoning business of esports they saw opportunities to not just own a team, but also own a league and create their own narrative franchise around the games, the teams, and their league. Week 3 Day 1 at 2018 NA LCS Spring Split in Los Angeles, California, USA on 3 February 2018. That’s where the new capital comes in. Through the new investment, money Vision Esports will take a majority position in the EchoFox franchise that was Fox’s brainchild and launched the group’s journey to the center of the esports earth. The conglomerate is also going to include Twin Galaxies, which began in 1981 as the ultimate source for video game world records, stats, and player analytics and is now creating in esports leagues in conjunction with game publishers. Finally, the group used some cash to take a majority position in Vision Entertainment, which produces esports related stories and livestreams for esports events. Now all of the various esports properties will sit under one roof and the team at Vision Esports can work on rolling out their first league, a battle royale-based competition the Twin Galaxies’ H1Z1 Pro League which will begin its inaugural season in April 2018. “This is just like pro sports,” says Scalvos.”Why wouldn’t you want to invest broadly across the spectrum so you have participation in the team side, participation in the league and the content? And we said, let’s be in all three parts of the ecosystem.” The economics speaks for itself. According to Scalvos, leagues are wildly more profitable than teams. “ Teams are great but leagues make 27 times the revenue,” he said. The approach that Vision Esports is taking to building their league (around the wildly popular battle royale format) alongside game publisher Daybreak Games is a new model. Activision/Blizzard and Riot chose not to partner with anyone for their competitive gaming leagues. Meanwhile, competitive gaming has existed outside of the control of game publishers for several years with Valve selling licenses to run tournaments worldwide, according to Scalvos. While much of the capital went to investments, Vision Esports also built out its team. Adding Chris Nordling, a former executive at MGM Resorts; Mike Mossholder who worked for the UFC; and Jace Hall who was with Warner Brothers Interactive. “It took a while to get here but this esports thing is here,” says Scalvos.

TYLER KEPNER,"“I think all of us look up to our dads a lot and try to emulate them; they’re all really good players,” Bichette said. “We’ll probably never outlast the fact that ‘he’s Craig’s son, he’s Dante’s son, he’s Senior’s son.’ But at the same time, we’re trying to make our own way, play hard and make a name for ourselves.” Bichette was 3 when his father retired as a player, but he was 15 in 2013, when Dante spent a year as the hitting coach for his primary team, the Colorado Rockies. Bo sometimes took batting practice with the players, but he taught himself his swing; Dante had wanted him to play tennis. “In tennis, you kind of create your own path,” Bo Bichette said. “You win, you advance. There’s no coach or front office that can tell you, ‘You’re playing well, but we’re going to continue to develop you.’” Maintaining his swing is critical to Bichette, who essentially tries to obliterate the ball before using a more conservative approach with two strikes. A right-handed hitter, he lifts his left knee, rocks his hands back with his left shoulder, and lets loose. Dante Bichette — who named Bo after Bo Jackson, whom he called “the coolest athlete ever” — raised his son to do what comes naturally. “I let him swing the bat as hard as he could,” said Dante, who led the National League in homers in 1995. “I’ve learned, through raising my older son, through playing, through coaching so many high-level kids, that we just put way too much into the swing. The swing is a natural thing; let it happen. There’s no ‘baseball swing,’ there’s an athletic move. So I let Bo just crush the ball and be free.” Bo’s older brother, Dante Bichette Jr., was the Yankees’ first choice in the 2011 draft. He hit.249 over seven seasons, peaking in Class AA. Now 25, he signed this month with the independent St. Paul Saints planning to convert to catcher and relearn his natural swing. Dante Sr. said that the Blue Jays, who have encouraged the unorthodox mechanics of sluggers like Jose Bautista and Josh Donaldson, were a perfect fit for Bo.","From left, Bo Bichette, Cavan Biggio and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. The three, all sons of former major league stars, play together in the infield for the Class AA New Hampshire Fisher Cats.",2018-04-20T18:54:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Now Batting in Class AA: Biggio, Bichette and Guerrero",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/sports/baseball/minor-leagues.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/20/sports/20fishercats-web01/20fishercats-web01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1

Reuters,"The FDA just approved Onpattro, a drug that works by silencing gneetic material. Bobby Yip/Reuters (Reuters) - Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc's drug for a rare hereditary disease won U.S. regulatory approval on Friday, becoming the first approved treatment from a new class of medicines that use gene silencing technology. Alnylam's patisiran, commercially named Onpattro, was approved to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, a potentially fatal condition that affects an estimated 50,000 people worldwide. Patients with the disease have a genetic mutation that prevents a type of protein from keeping its normal structure, instead causing it to fold into an incorrect shape and accumulate in the heart, nerves and other organs. This leads to loss of sensation, heart issues, eye, kidney and thyroid diseases. Polyneuropathy, a symptom of the disease, is the simultaneous malfunction of nerves resulting in tingling, numbness and kidney dysfunction. Using RNA interference (RNAi), a Nobel prize-winning mechanism hailed as a breakthrough in the 1990s, Alnylam's patisiran targets and ""silences"" specific genetic material, which helps block the production of the deadly protein. ""We are welcoming in an entire new class of medicines,"" Alnylam's President Barry Greene said in an interview ahead of the FDA's decision. ""Over time, RNAi therapeutics will be incredibly impactful over a wide range of diseases."" Other companies developing RNAi treatments include Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc and Arbutus Biopharma Corp. Alnylam plans to retain the global commercialization rights to Onpattro, Greene said. The drug has already received a positive opinion from European regulators and Alnylam expects approval in September. Alnylam is also developing other RNAi drugs to treat a range of conditions, including high cholesterol and genetic bleeding disorder hemophilia. Trading in Alnylam's shares was halted on Friday afternoon ahead of the FDA's decision. The stock was last up about 3 percent at $97.38.

Aarian Marshall,"Last Friday, the Northern District Court of California finally posted a long-awaited document, a letter written by the lawyer of an ex-Uber security employee. It was a doozy, a 37-page compendium of alleged criminal and unsavory activity witnessed by that employee, Ric Jacobs, while he worked at the company in 2016 and 2017. The letter came to light last week (after much legal tussling) as part of an ongoing lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car spinoff. Waymo alleges Anthony Levandowski, a former employee, made off with trade secrets when when he left to found his own company, then brought those secrets to Uber when it acquired the startup. It's bad news for Uber in this legal fight, but the damage may not stop there. That’s because Uber is fighting legal battles on myriad fronts, and the 37-page Jacobs letter is full of potential ammunition against it. The letter alleges the company coordinated an operation to hide documents from lawyers and regulators. It speaks of efforts to “hack” competitors’ apps, to steal trade secrets, data, passengers, and drivers. It claims Uber went to great lengths to evade and even bribe government officials. It accuses the company of violating California state law by recording a phone call about sexual harassment allegations without its participants’ consent. So don’t be surprised if many lawyers—federal prosecutors, lawmakers, those who have already filed lawsuits against Uber—are doing some reading. “Investigators have opened the lid off the trash can, and they’re finding all kinds of apple cores and corn cobs and paper plates,” says Timothy Heaphy, a former federal prosector and white collar defense specialist at the law firm Hunton &amp; Williams. Uber's potentially saving grace? It's unclear how much of the letter is true. Jacobs was in a legal dispute with the company when he wrote the letter, after all, and he had obvious motivation to make Uber look bad. Jacobs portrays himself as a whistleblower, but Uber says he's an extortionist. An Uber spokesperson said last week the company hadn’t substantiated all the claims in this letter. Jacobs himself walked back portions of the letter while testifying in court earlier this month, saying he did not believe Uber had set up a team dedicated to stealing trade secrets, or that Waymo was a particular target. (Jacobs said he had not read his lawyer’s letter closely enough because he was on vacation with his wife.) Still, Uber ultimately paid Jacobs $4.5 million as a ""consulting fee,” and another $3 million to his lawyer. But even if some of Jacobs' allegations are at least partly true, that’s great for federal investigators currently running probes into Uber, and looking for chances to make their names by taking down a big, bad Silicon Valley unicorn. To understand who should be interested in the Jacobs letter, let’s take a quick trip through Uber’s current legal qualms. An exhaustive report by Bloomberg reporter Eric Newcomer finds federal investigators have opened at least five probes against the company. The first is an investigation into criminal trade secret theft, which comes out of the Waymo lawsuit. The Jacobs letter’s section on Waymo alleges an Uber employee made oblique references to theoretical, secretive meetings between CEOs—perhaps the sorts of meetings that ex-Googler Levandowski and then-CEO Travis Kalanick might have used to hide conspiracy. The Uber employee testified that the presentation had in fact been a light-hearted primer on basic info protection measures, like keeping your computer and phone secure and not discussing private business in a restaurant. But if proven true, the letter's references could help investigators weave together a narrative of secretive, shifty behavior. Probe number two is a federal investigation into Uber’s pricing. Uber allegedly used specially built software to offer different prices to American riders who might be willing to pay more for trips—and then hid those price jumps from drivers. This could violate federal price transparency laws. The Jacobs letter alleges Uber stole trade secrets concerning competitors’ pricing and driver incentives structures, which could back up those suspicions. Next up, a look into Greyball, the software (first exposed by The New York Times ), which Uber show flagged users a dummy version of the app. The Jacobs letter makes a few indirect references to use of a Greyball-like program. It alleges one Uber team used untraceable devices to store intelligence on politicians, regulators, law enforcement, and taxi organizations, the kinds of people who might be interested in catching Uber running where and when it wasn't supposed to. And it alleges the existence of an internal “playbook” for combatting regulatory and reinforcement activities in at least one country. (Greyball was reportedly used in the US, France, Australia, China, and South Korea.) Probe three: Uber confirmed to the The Wall Street Journal in August that federal investigations were searching for Uber violations of laws prohibiting the bribery of foreign officials. The Jacobs letter notes the ex-Uber employee “reasonably believed the that bribery of foreign officials was taking place.” It alleges Uber artificially inflated wages paid to third party vendors in order to purchase ill-gotten information on politicians’ leanings on regulations. The fifth and final (well, as far as we know) federal inquiry looks into ""Hell"", Uber’s program to scrape data from competitor Lyft and gain insight into its drivers' behavior. A judge dismissed a Hell-related class action lawsuit against Uber in August, but the company confirmed the FBI is investigating the program this fall. The Jacobs letter alleges Uber teams found ways to pull competitors' confidential data without alerting them to the the theft. The teams also allegedly impersonated riders to create a database of competitors' driver's names, license plate numbers, and vehicle makes. Those are just the federal investigations in the US. When London pulled Uber's operating license this fall, it cited Greyball as one reason the company was no longer welcome. (Uber has appealed the decision, the case will be heard ind the new year, and its drivers continue to work there in the meantime.) Class action lawsuits—by taxi drivers, riders, and drivers themselves —are piling up, and the Jacobs letter could, theoretically, help them make all their cases. And, it could launch a few lawsuits of its own. ""To the extent that somebody now has a cause of action they may not have had before, it gives them evidence,” Peter Toren, a former federal prosector and now a trade secrets litigator, told WIRED last week. It's never fun to have your company's dirty laundry tossed about in public. But when there are lawyers involved, it could be downright dangerous.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / An employee arranges a display of Vizio Inc. high-definition televisions at a Best Buy Inc. store in Paramus, New Jersey, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 25, 2016. reader comments 3 Lawyers representing Vizio TV owners have asked a federal judge in Orange County, California to sign off on a proposed class-action settlement with the company for $17 million, for an affected class of 16 million people, who must opt-in to get any money. Vizio also agrees to delete all data that it collected. Notice of the lawsuit will be shown directly on the Vizio Smart TVs, three separate times, as well as through paper mailings. When its all said and done, new court filings submitted on Thursday say each of those 16 million people will get a payout of somewhere between $13 and $31. By contrast, their lawyers will collectively earn a maximum payout of $5.6 million in fees. As Ars has reported previously, the manufacturer has been under scrutiny since a 2015 revelation that it was snooping on its customers. The tracking started in February 2014 on both new TVs and previously sold devices that didn't originally ship with ACR software installed. The software periodically appended IP addresses to the collected data and also made it possible for more detailed personal informationincluding age, sex, income, marital status, household size, education level, home ownership, and home valuesto be associated. Eventually, the company agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission. However, this new settlement is related to an entirely separate lawsuit, one that was consolidated in federal court in southern California. This $17 million amount is more than Vizio made by licensing the data collected, according to a source with knowledge of the deal. A final hearing has been scheduled for December 7, 2018.","Years after ProPublica exposed TV maker, lawyers will make millions from lawsuit.",2018-10-05T20:52:14Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Lawyers for Vizio Smart TV owners propose final deal, around $20 per person",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/lawyers-for-vizio-smart-tv-owners-propose-final-deal-around-20-per-person/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-625747314-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-3,1

Joshua Calixto,"Blizzard has now announced all of the cards from Hearthstone s upcoming Rastakhans Rumble expansion, and once again, it looks like the Hearthstone metagame is in for a huge shake-up once it drops next week. On top of all the new mechanics that the set will introduce, there also seem to be a few cards that are specifically meant to counter strategies that are currently popular in the games most powerful decks. Heres a closer look at what to expect from Rastakhans Rumble. Overkill Rastakhan s new Overkill mechanic is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: if an Overkill card deals damage to an enemy minion in excess of that minions current health, the effect triggers. In practice, Overkill effects seem pretty good, but since your minion actually has to be able to attack to set off the effect, it seems that many Overkill minions will be doomed to die before they can take advantage of it. One of the worst-looking Overkill cards announced in the set, Arena Patron, is a 5-mana, 3-attack, 3-health minion that summons a new Patron upon overkill. Not only is a 5-mana 3/3 overcosted, its easy to kill and will probably never triggermaking it probably much weaker than Grim Patron, the extremely powerful card its referencing. It seems the real power of Overkill cards will come paired with the Rush ability, which allows minions to attack other minions on the turn theyre played. The Legendary minion Oondasta is a 9-mana 7/7 with Rush that summons a beast from your hand if you trigger the Overkill effect. Not only are you dealing 7 damage to a minion with Oondasta right off the bat, youre getting another minion on the board at the same time. A powerful effect, if youre able to trigger it. Other cards that give minions Rush could work wonders when used in tandem with Overkill. Captain Hooktusk, an 8-mana 6/3 minion, summons three Pirate minions from your deck and gives them Rush. This could pair perfectly with a card like Ticket Scalper, a 4-mana 5/3 that draws two cards on Overkill. The prospect of speeding up Overkill minions with Rush could make the Overkill mechanic even more powerful than it appearsmaybe even powerful enough to show up in top-tier decks. Loa, Spirit, and Champion Cards Whereas Hearthstone s previous expansion, The Boomsday Project, centered around Legendary scientists in the Warcraft lore and their accompanying spells, Rastakhans Rumble revolves around Legendary Trolls, powerful Legendary minions called Loa, and Spirit minion cards that all complement each other to give each class a unique identity. The Legendary Trolls are class-specific minion cards that each boast some kind of massive, class-defining effect. The Paladin Troll High Priest Thekal, for instance, is a 3-Mana 3/4 that converts all but 1 of your current health into Armor. The effect isnt too powerful on its own, but it opens up exciting possibilities for healing-heavy Paladin decks in the future, and synergizes with other powerful cards from this set like Zandalari Templar and Flash of Light. Loa cards are Legendary animal-based minions that also boast class-defining powers. The Druid Loa called Gonk, the Raptor is a 7-mana 4/9 that lets your Hero attack again every time it kills a minion. Thats a weak effect, but paired with other attack power-based Druid cards like Pounce, which gives your Hero +2 attack for a turn, might have some potential. To be honest, attack power Druid seems like a weak archetype overall, but thats probably a good thing when you consider that the class is already extremely strong. Finally, we have the Spirits, which are 0-attack minions that come into play with Stealth for a turn, and can provide powerful effects while theyre on the board. The Warlock Class Spirit of the Bat is a 2-mana 0/3 that gives a minion in your hand +1/+1 every time a minion on your board dies. The effect itself, again, isnt great, but it might prove worthy when paired with a card like the Warlock Loa Hireek the Bat, an 8-mana 1/1 that fills the board with copies of itself when played. Buff Hireek with Spirit of the Bat, play him on turn 8, and see if your opponent can wipe the board. Weird, potentially metagame-altering effects There are a lot of cards in this set that are difficult to evaluate just because their effects are so extreme. One Warlock card, Void Contract, blows up half of each players deck. Theres a Priest card called Surrender to Madness that destroys 3 of your own mana crystals to give all the minions in your deck +2 health and +2 attack. Another Priest card called Mass Hysteria makes every minion on the board fight another minion at random. And then theres Mojomaster Zihi, a neutral Legendary minion that sets each players Mana pool back to 5an extremely significant effect that can slow down Druids that love to cheat by boosting their Mana pools, and combo-based decks that look to pull off huge one-turn-kills at the end of the game. My personal favorite is Hakkar, the Soulflayer, a 10-mana 9/6 Deathrattle minion that shuffles a Corrupted Blood card into each players deck upon death. When drawn, Corrupted Blood deals 3 damage to your hero and shuffles two more copies of the card into your deck, which is an instant death sentence if you no longer have any cards in your deck. Rumble Run As with previous expansions, Rastakhans Rumble will see the launch of a new single-player mode called Rumble Run. Not many details have been released, but youll be able to choose a Troll champion, each with a different special ability, then run through a gauntlet of bosses while drafting new cards to make your deck more powerful.","Blizzard has now announced all of the cards from Hearthstone ’s upcoming Rastakhan’s Rumble expansion, and once again, it looks like the Hearthstone metagame is in for a huge shake-up once it drops next week.

Anjelica Oswald,"These are the faces of college students bored in class. Kelsey McNeal/Freeform A new year means new shows are heading to TV, and ""Grown-ish"" is an extremely welcome addition to the small screen this year. The ""Black-ish"" spin-off airs on Freeform and features Yara Shahidi as Zoey Johnson, the oldest of the Johnson kids from the ABC sitcom, as she heads off to college. The cast includes Francia Raisa, Luka Sabbat, Trevor Jackson, Jordan Buhat, Emily Arlook, and Chloe and Halle Bailey as Zoey's fellow classmates and friends. Chris Parnell stars as the university's dean. What's hot This is exactly what studying feels like. Eric Liebowitz/Freeform Starting with 17-year-old Shahidi, the ""Grown-ish"" cast is absolutely superb in their portrayal of young teens on their own for the first time. You've got the students who take school more seriously than others, you've got the students who like to party, and you've got student athletes. Each relationship is dynamic. Viewers can see how these students bond and why they are friends. Each episode also hits a specific college experience — whether it's a social experience or educational one. There's one episode dedicated to Zoey's love life and her obsession with a crush that really took me back to forming a crush on a boy in class and quite literally thinking of him at all times. While the comedy has its hilarious moments, it also really gets personal with Zoey's struggle for her own identity. She wants to be liked, but in her attempt at brief popularity, she does something she's not proud of. Her realization and later reconciliation show a growth that often occurs during the transition into young adulthood. She also struggles to manage her party persona and studiousness, which again is a very relatable college experience. What's not Sometimes you see embarrassing things in college. Freeform The weakest part of the show is the absurd late night ""drone"" class they all end up in because they missed registration for other classes. Lumping the students into a class is a great way to have them meet and bond, but it's just plain weird and boring at parts. The drone class is also a way to have Deon Cole return as his ""Black-ish"" character Charlie Telphy, who is revealed to be a part-time professor at the university. But again, his part seems random. The show is at its best when it focuses on the students. There are a few other moments that seem forced and awkward, but the show is just starting out. Everything about it is set up with great promise for the season. The bottom line Relationships can be stressful. Freeform In the first three episodes, ""Grown-ish"" touches on what it's like to be a Generation Z kid in college, but it's not unique to just them. Trying to balance school and a social life, facing the pressure of drugs, taking a class you really didn't want to take, having a crush, trying to talk to said crush, getting involved with social justice, having your own opinion, discovering your own identity — these are familiar experiences that many college-level students and millennials will understand. Of course some aspects of the show are over-exaggerated, but overall, ""Grown-ish"" manages to capture what it's like to head off on your own and transition into adulthood. It's relatable, and when so many shows are excessively over-the-top, this is a breath of fresh air. Grade: B ""Grown-ish"" premieres January 3 at 8 p.m. EST on Freeform.

Lulu Chang,"Uber can subtract one acse from its ever-expanding roster of legal woes (though it likely won’t make a dent). The ridesharing company has agreed to pay up to $3 million as a settlement for a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of 2,421 drivers in New York who claimed that Uber was underpaying them. In May 2017, the transportation giant admitted that it had “accidentally” underpaid drivers in the Big Apple for two and a half years, an oversight that was said at the time to amount to tens of millions of dollars. The settlement was initially filed in federal court on Monday, and still awaits approval from U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis, who is presiding over the case. But even as drivers and their lawyers await final approval, the decision marks a victory in what has become a multiyear ordeal (the complaint was originally filed in December 2015). “The $3 million settlement provides long-overdue compensation to the approximately 2,400 New York drivers that opted out of the arbitration provision in the Uber driver agreement,” said Philip Hines of Held &amp; Hines LLP, the law firm representing the drivers. “The overwhelming majority of New York drivers were not able to successfully opt out of arbitration, and so we are pursuing these same claims on behalf of these clients at arbitration proceedings.” In addition to having their wages excessively docked, the drivers also claim that Uber is guilty of “false advertising.” As per court filings, Uber suggested in both bus and billboard ads that drivers would make “$5,000 guaranteed” within a month of starting at Uber. Drivers, however, claimed this was patently false, and said that this claim required contract workers to “unlawfully … assume costs associated with the tools of their trade.” Uber, for its part, has denied charges of wrongdoing, and did not respond to requests for comment. After initially admitting that it had kept wages from drivers for years, however, the company noted in 2017: “We are working hard to regain driver trust, and that means being transparent, sticking to our word, and making the Uber experience better from end to end.” This settlement may help in making good on that promise.","Ridesharing company Uber has agreed to pay up to $3 million as a settlement for a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of 2,421 drivers in New York who claimed that Uber was underpaying them.",2018-01-12T00:49:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Digitaltrends.com'}","After underpaying its New York drivers for years, Uber settles for $3 million",https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/uber-lawsuit-underpay-drivers-3-million/,https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/uber-elevate-app_2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg,,Digitaltrends.com,class-3,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Everyone from Margot Robbie to Mary J Blige gathered in Los Angeles on Monday for the traditional Oscars ""class photo"". This year's Academy Awards contenders rubbed shoulders at the annual nominees' luncheon, which took place four weeks before they will regroup for ceremony itself. While the catering team at the Academy are probably getting sick of the sight of Meryl Streep, we certainly aren't. And nor do we ever tire of the irregularities and intriguing outfits which are always provided by the class photo. Here are 11 things we spotted this year. (Fortunately, Vanity Fair's Photoshop editor wasn't there to help so this is one Hollywood photo where nobody was given an extra leg.) 1. Firstly, is that... a cardboard cut-out? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes, yes it is. At 89 years old, Agnes Varda has already become the oldest nominee in Oscars history. The Belgian-born director is nominated in the best documentary film category for Visages Villages [Faces Places]. Sadly, Agnes couldn't make it to the luncheon in person. So her co-director JR held up a cardboard cut-out of her instead. We don't know why nobody has thought of this before - just think of all the weddings she must get out of attending. (Actually, does anybody know where you order one of these?) 2. Hey look it's Mitzeee from Hollyoaks Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk We don't often use the words ""Hollyoaks"" and ""Oscars"" in the same sentence. But, there she is, third row from the front and fourth from the right: Rachel Shenton. The Silent Child, written by Shenton and directed by another former Hollyoaks actor, Chris Overton, is nominated for best live action short film. ""I don't class myself as a writer so I felt grossly underqualified doing this,"" she said last month. But she certainly isn't out of place in this year's class photo. 3. This chap has been going to the gym and he'd like you to know about it Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk ""Oh this? Oh it's just my bicep. I'd totally forgotten it was there! Goodness gracious, what am I like, eh?"" That's Dunkirk cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema in the back row. 4. Eric Fellner would make a poor spy Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk The co-chairman of Working Title films might have managed to stay behind the scenes as a producer of Victoria &amp; Abdul but had less success going undetected here, peering out from behind the giant statuette. Of course, he may have been placed there deliberately given his uncanny resemblance to Oscar himself. 5. Basketball injuries went unnoticed Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's Common in the back row, nominated for best original song alongside Diane Warren for Stand Up For Something from the film Marshall. The rapper was looking so dapper you probably wouldn't notice he was actually trying to hide a black eye. He wore a pair of glasses in the hope of trying to hide the bruise he sustained after a basketball mishap at the weekend. 6. Not everybody was successful in looking at the camera Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's always one. Or, in this case, two. We've all been Mudbound director Dee Rees at some point and managed to blink at the precise moment a photo is being taken. (Although in our case it only affects our 62 Instagram followers rather than the millions of people that will see an iconic and significant piece of film history.) Sam Rockwell did keep his eyes open, but smiling and looking at the camera proved too much. 7. People in Los Angeles really need to stop using Justin Timberlake's tailor Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk After last year's trouser-gate, we really thought 2018 would be different. Not only is Raphael Saadiq sporting a rather brave beige trousers/grey socks combo, but the tailor had clearly run out of fabric by the time the music producer got round to ordering an outfit. WHEN WILL THEY LEARN? *shakes fist* 8. It wasn't all grey Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk In a sea of dull suits and generic ties, a few brave souls stood out from the crowd with a splash of colour. We particularly salute make-up artist Daniel Phillips, Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan and The Big Sick writer Emily V Gordon. We don't care if they don't win any actual trophies - they have already won this year's photo. 9. Quite a lot of men aren't there? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes. 126 to be precise. With 46 women. (And one of them is a cardboard cut-out.) It's an issue Academy president John Bailey is aware of, making reference to the gender imbalance when he spoke at the luncheon. ""The Academy is at a crossroads of change,"" he said. ""We are witnessing this motion picture academy reinvent itself in front of our very eyes, and a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."" 10. Kobe Bryant is sitting down Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Which is a very sensible idea, given that he's six-and-a-half feet tall. Had he been allowed to stand up, he certainly would have obscured Breadwinner director Nora Twomey and make-up artist David Malinowski at the very least, who were right behind him. They probably could have sat him on the floor and he'd still tower over half the people there. 11. But which nominees are missing from this photo? Image copyright Getty / PA Well, Daniel Day-Lewis is absent, because of course he is. (Possibly because he was busy ordering a bigger trophy cabinet from Ikea.) He wasn't the only Phantom Thread star who didn't make it though - best supporting actress nominee Lesley Manville is nowhere to be seen either. Elsewhere, Christopher Plummer was also absent from the luncheon, although he could probably be edited in later. Denzel Washington and Woody Harrelson, nominated in the best actor and supporting actor categories respectively, also sent their apologies. Perhaps one of the most notable absentees is best actress favourite Frances McDormand, who's nominated for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Bonus: The 'alternative' picture Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk As is tradition, the photographer also took a ""fun"" version of the photo, where the nominees were encouraged to pull funny faces or different poses. Several just applauded, others put their thumbs up, but full marks go to Watu Wote: All of Us director Katja Benrath, in the front row, for the slightly-more-original rock on hand sign, and Dear Basketball animator Glen Keane for managing to obscure his own face with his arm while waving from the fifth row.

Reuters,"A Tesla Model 3 at the company's retail store at Westfield Century City. Bryan Logan/Business Insider SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla on Friday asked a court to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit by shareholders who said the electric vehicle maker gave false public statements about the progress of producing its new Model 3 sedan. In a filing in federal court in San Francisco, Tesla said that its statements about the challenges the company faced with Model 3 were ""frank and in plain language,"" including repeated disclosures by Chief Executive Elon Musk of ""production hell."" Tesla did not seek to hide the truth, its motion to dismiss said. The company says its Model 3 has experienced numerous ""bottlenecks"" from problems withTesla's battery module process at its Nevada Gigafactory to general assembly at its Fremont plant. Tesla is under pressure to deliver the Model 3 to reap revenue and stem massive spending that has put Tesla's finances in the red. The ramp of the Model 3, Tesla said in the court filing, was ""the first of its kind,"" with difficulties likely to crop up after it got underway. The lawsuit filed last October seeks class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stock between May 4, 2016 through October 6, 2017, inclusive. It said shareholders bought ""artificially inflated"" shares because Musk and other executives misled them with their statements. Tesla made such statements during the lead-up to, and early production of, its Model 3 sedan and failed to disclose that the company was ""woefully unprepared"" for the vehicle's production, the lawsuit said. A hearing is scheduled for August. The Tesla response chronicled disclosures of production bottlenecks the company faced in its third quarter of 2017 when it fell short of its targets. Tesla's statements that its Model 3 production was ""on track"" in May and August of 2017 - which plaintiffs argue were false - were made before production problems began to surface, Teslaargued. Tesla said its ""good faith belief"" in the Model 3 program is reflected in everything it has done: a $4 billion investment, the build-out of its Gigafactory battery factory in Nevada and the high-volume equipment it commissioned.

 (CNN)This is why we can't have nice things. 
Local liberal activists -- championed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- loudly protested Amazon's decision to move half its eastern hub to Long Island City ever since it was announced. 
Amazon just called their bluff and is now pulling the plug on the $2.5 billion deal that would have permanently brought 25,000 high paying jobs to the heart of Queens. This isn't a win for liberal Democrats -- it's a face plant, an epic fail. 
The activists were outraged that the incentives given to the world's wealthiest company were too generous. But they just screwed their community by depriving it of a transformational investment. It's a painful reminder that nobody wins when the not-in-my-backyard activist crowd stands in the way of the real progress that comes from investment. 
Remember that Long Island City won the lottery when New York City and the state successfully bid on the campus that every large -- and most medium size -- cities were hoping to land. 
After all, Amazon choosing a community could shift its fortunes overnight with the promise of sustained investment. It would have been a game changer for Baltimore, Newark or Philadelphia. But Long Island City won on the strength of New York City's resurgence and a generous $3 billion incentive package that included massive tax incentives -- which means a reduction in New York's sky-high business taxes. For what it's worth, that was less of a tax incentive package than other cities, such as Newark, were offering. 
But the activist class doesn't understand that the real prize isn't tax revenue. It's local economic growth and the kind of vibrancy that occurs when local small businesses -- restaurants and shops -- start springing up in the community. 
Yes, there are winners and losers when investment comes and local rents rise. But it is foolish to fetishize rusted-out communities that have little economic activity or to presume that government investment can create a vibrant local community as much as private enterprise can. 
Perhaps the protesting local pols were merely hoping that their anger would translate to a better deal on the margins -- more money set aside for infrastructure, for example. But people tend to negotiate in better faith when they're not being yelled at. 
So New York is left looking like a loser, out of touch and extreme. It just spurned an investment that other cities and communities were competing hard for. And Amazon announced that no other city would get second prize; they would focus their efforts on more business-friendly Virginia and Tennessee. 
In the process, the right wing gets a substantive talking point to bolster their negative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez obsession. This will only reinforce their fear-fueled hyperpartisan narrative that all Democrats are anti-business proto-socialists. But every political stereotype has a kernel of truth -- or it wouldn't stick. 
There's a lesson here for business beyond the fact that they don't need to be a perpetual punching bag. Income inequality in our country has become unsustainable and destabilizing. The three richest Americans control as much wealth as the bottom 160 million.
That inequality creates a destructive dynamic that is going to logically lead to more redistributionist policies. Businesses are going to need to think bigger about the connection to communities. But that conversation will be around inclusive public-private partnerships, not protesters who pretend that they can win with unilateral demands. 
There should be scrutiny when big business tries to write special rules for its benefit. But local investment unleashes larger creative dynamics that improve the quality of life for the community. And that's what the activist class should be focused on.",Local liberal activists loudly protested Amazon's decision to move half its eastern hub  to Long Island City ever since it was announced.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, SERGE F. KOVALESKI and PATRICIA MAZZEI","“Are you aware of the situation right now,” Daniel texted his mother, who speaks Portuguese. “What happened,” she texted back. “Alguma coisa na escola?” Something at school? And then: “Are you O.K.?” Six Harrowing Minutes It was Valentine’s Day. The morning and early afternoon had unfolded in a whirl of big balloons, stuffed animals and multicolored carnations from a $1 flower sale. The gay/straight student alliance encouraged students to sign “declarations of love.” Daniel, 17, a star on the varsity soccer team, had given his girlfriend chocolates in the parking lot before school. Just after 2 p.m., Mr. Cruz, 19, took a compact gold Uber car to campus. Mr. Cruz was texting from inside the car with a student at Stoneman Douglas, the son of a family that had taken him in after his mother died in November. Earlier that day, Mr. Cruz had texted: “I have to tell you something important soon.” Photo Left, messages between Daniel Medeiros, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, to his mother. Right, messages from Jackie McKenna to her mother, Tina McKenna. But when his friend asked what, Mr. Cruz did not explain. “Nothing man,” he wrote from inside the Uber, heading to the school where his friend was in class. His final text came at 2:18 p.m., a minute before the car dropped him off. “Yo,” he wrote. Then he entered the three-story Freshman Building, carrying an AR-15 in a soft black rifle case. Chris McKenna, a 15-year-old freshman, was trying to get to the bathroom in the building when he encountered Mr. Cruz in the stairwell. Mr. Cruz was loading bullets into his rifle. “He told me, ‘Better get out of here, things are about to get messy,’” Chris recalled. “I had no idea who he was.” At 2:21 p.m., Mr. Cruz began shooting into four classrooms. Moises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when the gunfire boomed. The students scurried to get as far away from the door as possible. Moises, who turned 18 on Friday, counted eight shots before the bullets shattered the glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who “wasn’t moving at all.” “She was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn’t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,” Moises said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Moises squeezed the hand of his sister’s best friend, who was bleeding from a bullet that grazed her knee. Another boy called 911. “I was too scared to look up, so I kept my head down, looking at the floor,” Moises said. “The shots were something I’ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time. If I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.” Photo Aaron Feis, left, an assistant football coach, and Scott Beigel, right, a geography teacher. Both men were killed trying to help students during the shooting. After his run-in with Mr. Cruz in the stairwell, Chris went out the closest door and told Aaron Feis, a football coach and security guard, what he had seen. Mr. Feis took Chris on his golf cart to a baseball field, about 500 feet away from the Freshman Building. “He said, ‘Stay here,’” Chris recalled. “So I stood there for a little bit, and then I heard shots go off, and from there I ran fast as I could to Walmart.” Other students later said Mr. Feis had died shielding people from gunfire. Inside the building, Mr. Cruz had moved to the second floor and shot someone in a classroom. Calls began streaming into 911. A description of the shooter went out over police radio: maroon shirt, black pants and a black hat, and carrying a black duffel bag and a black backpack. It was 2:24 p.m. Mr. Cruz climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Scott Beigel, 35, taught freshman geography. He had broken the class into small groups for a quiz game on Asian geography. Mr. Beigel had initially accompanied his class down to the second floor when the alarm went off. But as shots echoed through the hallways, he shepherded them back upstairs to take cover in the classroom. One of the last students to slip inside the classroom was Matthew Zeif, 14, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Seconds later, the room filled with smoky haze, Matthew remembered. He turned to see his teacher lying by the door, pale and bleeding. He had been shot before he could lock the door. As students pressed themselves against the wall, they worried that the gunman would enter the room. Haeseung, who had rushed into a classroom full of incredulous students, eventually heard an administrator on the intercom speaking in a serious tone he had never heard before: “He said, ‘evacuate the building right now.’ So I ran again.” He rushed outside to the bus loop, but teachers yelled at him to go back inside. He ended up in a counseling office with 50 other students, behind locked metal doors. Everyone was texting and calling friends and family. Haeseung sent numerous texts to his friend Ben Wikander, who had been in psychology class with him. Ben did not respond. According to news reports, he had been shot three times and underwent surgery on Thursday. Photo Students raised their hands as law enforcement entered their classroom. Credit via Reuters Mr. Cruz entered the third-floor stairwell at 2:27 p.m., dropped the rifle and backpack, and ran down the stairs, eventually blending in with the fleeing students. A Continuing Panic Students began streaming off campus, running for their lives. Others remained holed up in classrooms, storage areas and bathrooms, unsure what to do as their panicking parents rushed as close to the blocked-off school as they could get. Cellphones erupted with instructions, pleas for help and rumors. Andrew Gilroy, whose house is just behind the high school, received an alarming text from his 15-year-old son, William, a freshman, at 2:38 p.m. “I think theirs a shooter at school,” the text said. “We’re on lockdown. We’re in a closet.” Mr. Gilroy quickly responded: “OMG. Be smart.” William texted: “Do u hear sirens from our house?” Mr. Gilroy went outside and stood atop a berm in his backyard, peering at the school through trees and shrubs for any clues about what was happening. He had not heard any shooting. Mr. Gilroy wrote: “Not yet … Tell everyone to be quiet … Oxygen and air. Noise discipline.” William replied a few minutes later: “OK. I heard they got him but I don’t know.” William texted again, saying that his friend Eric and some others were coming to the house to seek refuge. “So u know.” Photo People embracing outside a Marriott hotel where students were taken after the shooting. Credit Mark Wilson/Getty Images William was still hiding in a closet in a classroom in the Freshman Building. About 10 students showed up at the house. Two of them were crying and badly shaken up. The teenagers wanted to stay outside and watch things develop at the school from afar. Mr. Gilroy insisted that they all go inside. “I’m thinking that the shooter could be coming through here or there may be more than one shooter,” he said. “I told the kids, ‘Come in the house. We are locking this down.’” Mr. Gilroy discreetly armed himself with a 9-mm handgun. “Just in case,” he said. After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart down the road and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald’s across the street. Then, as he strolled down a quiet residential street less than half a mile away, where a couple of people were walking their dogs, he was spotted by a police officer. Michael Leonard had been called in from the neighboring city of Coconut Creek for the emergency, but he decided to peel away from the mass of patrols of the school to comb the nearby streets. “He looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?” Officer Leonard said of Mr. Cruz. He wore a maroon shirt and black pants. The description matched. Officer Leonard pulled over. Mr. Cruz complied with orders and did not resist arrest. But the confusion and fear continued. Students still on campus waited long into the afternoon as the police swept the buildings and led them out. Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old senior who was hiding with fellow students in a classroom closet, shrank in terror when a SWAT team entered around 3:45 p.m. “I think every person’s heart stopped when we heard noise,” Delaney said. “We didn’t know if it’s someone coming to help you or to kill you.” From afternoon to late in the evening, the parking lot in front of a nearby Marriott, a designated pickup point for parents, was packed with police vehicles. Mothers and fathers arrived ashen-faced. Some left with relieved smiles, reunited with their children. By 9:30 p.m., foot traffic had slowed, save for a few Red Cross volunteers bringing water and snacks to parents who were still inside the hotel, still waiting.

Ben Lovejoy,"We’ve recently seen no fewer than three class action lawsuits regarding the butterfly keyboard used in the MacBook Pro, and now it’s the turn of the Apple Watch. A new class action lawsuit claims that all models of the Apple Watch, from Series 0 to Series 3, share the same defect … Patently Apple reports that the lawsuit claims that a defect results in the screens cracking, shattering or detaching. The Watches all contain the same defect and/or flaw, which causes the screens on the Watches to crack, shatter, or detach from the body of the Watch (the “Defect”), through no fault of the wearer, oftentimes only days or weeks after purchase. It further alleges that Apple was aware of the defect from the start, and has a policy of refusing to honor warranty claims for the issue. Apple knew that the Watches were defective at or before the time it began selling them to the public. Furthermore, consumers complained to Apple about the Defect almost immediately after Apple released the Series 0, Series 1, Series 2, and Series 3 Watches. Apple has actively concealed and failed to disclose the Defect to Plaintiff and Class members prior to, at, or after the time of purchase. Further, Apple’s conduct, when confronted with the Defect, indicates that its internal policy is to deny the existence of the Defect, claim the Defect is the result of “accidental damage” caused by consumers, and then refuse to honor its Limited Warranty on those grounds. The lawsuit seeks damages of $5M. Apple has acknowledged two issues with the Series 0 models, extending warranties to three years for both swollen batteries and detached back covers. It later offered the same extension to certain Series 2 models with expanded batteries, and identified a separate issue with some Series 3 models showing visible stripe markings on the display. None of the issues so far acknowledged by Apple address cracked or detached displays, though this would be one potential result of a swollen battery.

Darrell Etherington,"Tesla’s Model 3 is making progress heading out to customers (though not as much as either Tesla or those on the waiting list would like) and as a result, we got a chance to spend some time in one of the new production models that just rolled off the line. The Model 3 is a much more affordable car from Tesla than either its Model S or Model X, and it hopes to one day achieve true mass market success. Tesla managed to amass somewhere around 500,000 pre-orders for the car, so it’s definitely a hotly anticipated item. This is the kind of enthusiasm generally reserved not for vehicles, but for high demand consumer electronics. Make no mistake, however: The Model 3 is a car first, and a gadget second, and probably the most fun you can buy on four wheels on real roads at this price point. As equipped, the Model 3 we test drove had a retail price of around $52,500, which includes all the upgrade options, Autopilot and longer driving range thanks to an enhanced battery pack. It also includes a panorama-style all glass roof and leather-appointed seating. For the time being, the extended range option is the only choice for new Model 3 buyers (the basic model will be available once there’s more production volume), so at the very least your starting price is going to be $44,000 for now. That puts the car in a class with other entry level luxury vehicles like the BMW 530e hybrid, for instance, so it’s not exactly an ‘affordable’ car in the traditional sense. But it’s still potentially going to be able to net you some tax incentives, and it’s about half the price of a similarly appointed Model S or Model X. And while driving the Model S and Model X is definitely a different experience, there’s a lot more similarity between driving one of those and driving the Model 3 than you might expect. The all-electric rear-wheel drive powertrain, which provides instant acceleration that feels like more power than you have any right to expect from this kind of car. To me, its acceleration felt more manageable than the truly awesome amount of power present on the Tesla Model X P100D I tested out last month – but still truly thrilling measured on any scale. In fact, the most fun I had with the Model 3 while testing the car was in driving it up and down a windy road with a few clear straightaways in a sleepy Northern California rural town. The roadway was empty save for me and the Model 3, and I got the chance to see how it did getting up to 60 from a stop start, and how it handles those curves. Bottom line: It’s quick to achieve speed, and it hugs the road like it’s glued to the thing (the bottom-heavy design thanks to the battery pack helps), so you can really take the corners in stride. On the highway, the quick acceleration helps when you’re dealing with tricky merges, and of course the Model 3 has Autopilot on board, which works just as it does in other vehicles in Tesla’s lineup. It’s a godsend in California traffic, and likely just as effective anywhere you’re stuck with stop-and-go freeway or highway driving. Driving is where the Tesla Model 3 excels the most, which is why I wanted to lead with that in this review – this is a driver’s car, built not just for people who know they love to drive, but also for people who might not be aware of how much fun it can be, especially if you’ve never had the pleasure of using a vehicle with an electric powertrain before. Cars including the BMW i3, the Chevrolet Bolt, the Tesla Model S and Model X, and now the Model 3 have all ruined me for internal combustion engine cars: One you’ve gone electric, you can’t really go back. The Model 3 also does as much as possible to draw focus to the driving experience. In large part, this is due to the spare cockpit design, which moves all instrumentation and information display to the single, 16-inch touchscreen panel mounted in the center of the dash. This screen is occupied on the left third by key information relevant to the driver (and indeed sits just in your peripheral view while looking straight out the windshield) and the remaining two-thirds is taken up by information display about routing, media, car settings and more. It’s a bit of a mixed blessing in terms of a vehicle interface: On the one hand, it’s terrific to have an unobstructed view of the road – it’s as pure as driving experience as rolling down the track in the soapbox derby car of your youth, and it really leaves you feeling connected to the road itself. The effect is aided by the lack of any obvious vents, since the dash has one full-length break that handles all of the air circulation by pitting two air foils against one another to direct air very precisely where you want it to go. The steering wheel is still there, of course, and it features a stock-mounted lever for putting the car into drive, reverse and park, and for controlling Autopilot if enabled. The wheel also has two multipurpose, multidirectional controllers both right and left of center. The left controls volume and track skipping, as well as play/pause for media by default. The right doesn’t do anything by default right now, but Tesla is considering using it for managing speed when Autopilot is engaged (currently handled via touchscreen). Those two controls are contextually variable, so they can control the angle of your rear view mirrors when you’re adjusting those via the center screen, for instance. Tesla left them unlabeled by design because they wanted them to be flexible, and in general it seems like a good idea, if it still needs a bit of working out in terms of how it works in practice. The Model 3’s biggest weakness, overall, is the touchscreen interface. It’s actually an excellent touchscreen, with very responsive scrolling and touch detection, smooth animations and zero missed taps during my usage. The problem is that there’s a lot to wade through to find just what you’re looking for, and it doesn’t do enough to simplify and declutter the experience for use specifically while driving. I actually got used to a lot of the system’s quirks quicker than I thought I would, but it’s still definitely something where I would’ve appreciated a few physical controls for specific functions, including windshield wipers, even if it spoiled the cockpit’s otherwise excellent minimalist design. That’s actually the only real issue I had with the Model 3 during testing, and it was not negative enough that it would prevent me from buying one of these, were I in the market for a new car, with available funds and availability of stock on Tesla’s end. This is easily the most fun car I’ve driven in this price range that I can recall, and while occasionally clunky, the touchscreen didn’t impede my enjoyment or my ability to drive the vehicle safely at any time during testing. Other reviewers have noted some problems with body panel fit and finish on their review cars; Tesla said mine was freshly entered into the press fleet, so that might be why I didn’t notice any of said problems, but I genuinely didn’t see any of those flaws even if they existed. Tesla’s biggest issue with this vehicle is that it can’t make enough to come anywhere close to satisfying demand. The Model 3 is finally in more showrooms across the country, but it’s still going to take a while to satisfy existing orders, let alone to begin filling new ones. The bottom line is that if you need a car in the next few years or so but you’re happy to wait (potentially) that long, it might be worth putting up a down payment to save your spot in line. The Model 3 is a solid piece of eccentric joy in a market filled with staid and boring choices.","Tesla’s Model 3 is making progress heading out to customers (though not as much as either Tesla or those on the waiting list would like) and as a result, we got a chance to spend some time in one of the new production models that just rolled off the line.

Timothy B. Lee,"Enlarge / The Lucid Air, due out in 2020. reader comments 10 Lucid Motors, the electric car startup we described as Tesla's most credible rival last year, got a shot in the arm on Monday as Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund announced a $1 billion investment. The company aims to bring its first car to market in 2020. Lucid has been building up to this moment for more than a decade. The company was founded in 2007 under the name Atieva to build technology related to electric cars—but not the entire car itself. In 2015, the Chinese state-owned automaker BAIC became Lucid's biggest investor, and we learned that Atieva was pivoting to face Tesla head-on by building an electric car of its own. The company rebranded as Lucid two years ago and has a number of Tesla veterans—including chief technology officer Peter Rawlinson—helping design its first car, the Lucid Air. Ars Technica's Jonathan Gitlin got a firsthand look at a prototype of Lucid's first model, the Lucid Air, 18 months ago, and he liked what he saw. Gitlin described it as ""remarkably functional for such an early stage in the development process."" Lucid is aiming for the same luxury sedan market as Tesla's Model S. Lucid brags that its prototype is the size of a Mercedes-Benz E Class while offering more interior space than the roomier S Class. We reported last year that the high-end model is expected to cost upwards of $100,000. It will come with a dual-motor, 1,000 horsepower setup that enables acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. While the company has an impressive prototype, what it hasn't had, until now, is enough money to turn that into a shipping commercial product. Lucid announced early last year that it was building a factory in Arizona, but work on the factory stalled for more than a year as Lucid looked for $700 million in financing. Raising $1 billion from Saudi Arabia will finally allow Lucid to move ahead at full speed, with production now scheduled to begin in 2020. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund also took a significant position in Tesla earlier this year. If Tesla's history is any indication, the company will need to raise more money—probably a lot more—if it hopes to become a mainstream carmaker. Tesla has burned through billions of dollars in recent years as it brought the Model X, the Model X, and then the Model 3 to market.",Lucid's impressive technology has been held back by a cash shortage.,2018-09-17T20:51:03Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Tesla’s most credible rival raises $1 billion from Saudi Arabia,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/lucid-motors-raises-1-billion-to-build-all-electric-cars-in-arizona/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lucid-Air-Exterior-9-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-3,1
Livemint,"KOLKATA: The country's first Rajdhani Express, which revolutionised Indian Railways by way of speed and luxury in the 1960s, turned 50 Sunday as the flower-beddecked train chugged out of Howrah station on its golden jubilee run.
An Eastern Railway (ER) official said that the Kolkata-New Delhi Rajdhani Express embarked on its maiden journey on 3 March, 1969 from Howrah, making it the country's first fully-airconditioned, high-speed train that covered the 1,450 km stretch in 17 hours and 20 minutes.
The red and yellow marigold beddecked train was flagged off by three former staff of Rajdhani Express after a ceremonial cake cutting and release of a greeting stamp to commemorate the epoch-making event.
Senior officers of ER, including its general manager Harindra Rao, were present at platform number 9, which has been the berthing place of Rajdhani Express since inception.
Passengers of the golden jubilee run of the train were treated to some of its old delicacies like fish fry or vegetable cutlets and 'rosogollas' apart from ice cream for dessert, said IRCTC (East) general manager Debasish Chandra.
Rajdhani was the first train in the country whose fares included charges for meals served.
Brand new linen and disposable napkins with greetings of ""50 Years of Rajdhani Express"" were distributed among the passengers, the ER official said.
The railway staff on duty in the train wore a badge with the message of celebration of 50 glorious years of Kolkata Rajdhani Express.
Rajdhani Express commenced its maiden journey from Howrah on this day in 1969 with nine vacuum braked coaches built at Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Perambur, consisting of two power cars, five AC chair cars, one AC dining car and one AC first class coach.
With the passage of time, the chair cars were replaced with AC 2-tier and AC 3-tier coaches, apart from increasing the number of AC first class coaches, while the dining car was done away with.
The iconic train went through stages of evolution over the years, the official said, adding that the present Kolkata Rajdhani Express was upgraded with elegant makeover of existing LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) coaches in 2017.
The train is at present composed of 20 LHB coaches consisting two AC First Class, five AC 2-tier, 10 AC 3-tier with one Pantry Car and 2 Power cars-cum-luggage vans.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Nationwide, 62 percent of the jail population accounts for people who can’t afford bail, according to the Vera Institute of Justice. A lot of these incarcerated individuals are behind bars because they committed crimes at the misdemeanor level or lower. This is a significant statistic from a human rights perspective, as well as an economic one. It costs about $38 million a day to keep these largely nonviolent people behind bars, according to the Pretrial Justice Institute. This is where Promise, a de-carceration startup that just raised a $3 million round led by First Round Capital with participation from Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, 8VC and Kapor Capital, comes in. Last Father’s Day, Jay-Z penned an op-ed about the bail industry and pre-trial incarceration. He noted how every year, $9 billion is wasted incarcerating people who have not been convicted of crimes. “We are increasingly alarmed by the injustice in our criminal justice system,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “Money, time and lives are wasted with the current policies. It’s time for an innovative and progressive technology that offers sustainable solutions to tough problems. Promise’s team, led by co-founder and CEO Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, is building an app that can help provide ‘liberty and justice for all’ to millions.” Promise, which is part of Y Combinator’s current batch of startups, offers counties and local governments an alternative to holding low-risk people behind bars simply because they can’t afford bail. For each participant, Promise provides counties with a comprehensive intake procedure and then sets up each participant with a care plan specific to them. Promise will then monitor and support participants by helping them ensure they know when they’re supposed to appear in court, and remind them of obligations like drug testing or substance abuse treatment needed. The app also provides participants with job training, housing, counseling and referrals. “People are going to jail because they look at a piece of paper and misread it, or are going to jail because they can’t afford a class because they’re instead paying child support,” Ellis-Lamkins told TechCrunch. And many of these people are brown or black. Last year, when Senators Kamala Harris and Rand Paul introduced a bail reform bill, the Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act, they wrote in an op-ed how black and Latinx people are more likely to be detained before trial and less likely able to pay for bail. Senators Harris and Paul pointed to how black and Latino men pay 35 percent and 19 percent higher bail, respectively, than white men. “If we’re putting people in jail because they’re poor, brown or black, we’re spending money the wrong way,” Ellis-Lamkins said. With Promise, Ellis-Lamkins and her team are using technology to try to create a system that works better for everyone, she said. Instead of a county paying to incarcerate someone simply because they can’t afford to post bail, they can use Promise to monitor compliance with court orders and better keep tabs on people via the app and, if needed, GPS monitoring devices. Counties, courts, case managers and other stakeholders can also access progress reports of individuals to monitor compliance. Already, Promise is onboarding one county this week and is in talks with another three counties. Instead of a county jail paying $190 per day per person, Ellis-Lamkins said, Promise charges counties just $17 per person per day. “Our system is built on reducing recidivism,” Ellis-Lamkins said. “Our ideal outcome is the person gets a job, does not reoffend and does not continue in the system.”","Nationwide, 62 percent of the jail population accounts for people who can’t afford bail, according to the Vera Institute of Justice.

Hey y'all, just wanted to remind everyone that Daylight Savings time starts this Sunday, March 11 at 2:00 am — and yes, we lose an hour of sleep on this one. There are a few things to be happy about, though: We're springing forward, which means we get an extra hour of daylight tacked on to the end of the day.

ari2021,"This is an instructable on how to create boxes varying from different sizes and shapes using the Box and Gravit designer program. In the Engineering class, our assignment was to create 3 different boxes for 3 different purposes such as a box specifically meant for the class, a box for a teacher, and a box for home. Step 1: The Design Process First off, you want to get an idea of your box's purpose. You can begin by brainstorming and sketching out the design you're mostly leaning for. As you can see from the image, I not only designed one box, I added an extra element, serving its purpose as a paperclip box for a teacher on campus to use. Step 2: Box Designer After the designing process and determining your final design, you want to insert your box's dimensions into Boxdesigner.com and 0.257 being your material thickness. Keep in mind you want to save this as an SVG file. If for any reason you want to add any extra elements such as slanting your boxes or engraving words Gravit designer will become useful for that specific reason. Step 3: Gravit Designer Next, your design has to be transitioned from Box designer to gravitdesigner.com, this can be done by making a free account on the website. After making your Gravit designer account, you will make a new file using your box design by clicking on the ""Open from Computer"" option. From there you will click on your personalized box. My box did not necessarily have extra elements added in, except for the fact that my box will include a rectangular hole embedded into the top of the box. Step 4: Extra Gravit Designer Elements If you're planning to make a box with no circles or rectangles to be cut out skip to the next step. My box design was originally set to have a rectangular cut out at the top of the box Step 5: Transitioning to the Laser Cutter After saving the Gravit designer SVG file, you will transition into converting it to an AI. (Instructions provided by Mr. Smith). Once all files have been converted, you will save these files into a flash drive. These files saved into the flash drive will later be helpful for Laser-cutting. (Instructions for using the Laser-cutter will be provided by the maker-space) Step 6: Assemble, Glue &amp; Sand Down After you have transferred all of your files into the laser cutter and followed all of the provided steps, you will have successfully created your pieces. You will then assemble all of your pieces together if the pieces work out fine proceed to use wood glue to attach each individual fitting piece together: while all pieces are attached do as I did with my box and wrap masking tape around it (drying could take about a day or so). After pieces have completely glued together it is time to sand down (if needed) my box however, I did need sanding so I sanded until all sides were completely flat Step 7: Extra (Artsy Elements) I proceeded to write ""Howard's Clips"" in calligraphy and used masking tape around my box to help create fine lines (as triangles) with acrylic paint. I used 4 different shades of acrylic color and 1 of them being white. I painted on top of each blank triangle (with no tape) Though adding special such as mine are not necessary, I chose to go on this route to make my design aesthetically pleasing to look at Step 8: Untape and Spray Paint After the acrylic paint eventually dried up, I untaped the masking tape from the box and it revealed a variety of shades of triangles at they all fit very well together, at this point the box was looking aesthetically pleasing to look at so, therefore, I was pretty satisfied. The next step for me was to spray paint. In order to do this, you will have to find a place outside to place your box. Depending on the forecast you will have to find a comfortable place to spray paint. I had to stand at least 1 foot apart from my box and carefully spray and coat my box from each side. My box was not too big therefore, I was done in a matter of minutes. After this, I left the box outside to air dry. Step 9: The Final Result Lastly, after waiting for two days to pick my design up from drying. I was extremely satisfied with how it turned out. One, the art element added to it was an extremely nice piece I liked, the calligraphy added was also a nice touch to the box. I made something extremely basic into an amazing final result Share Recommendations Discussions What were the other two boxes that you created?

Chloe Bryan,"For the unseasoned athlete, YouTube workouts can be pretty difficult. For some people (hello), they can also feel deeply embarrassing. To be clear, we're not knocking the power of the high-energy, Blogilates-type workout vid — those can be extremely motivational for someone who wants to dial up to 11. But if you're looking for something a little more chill and a little less corny, YouTube can be a bit of a minefield. SEE ALSO: YouTube celebrities worth following who aren't Logan Paul That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions. In fact, there are plenty of approachable fitness channels out there — ones that do not involve EDM of any kind and won't make you feel mortified when your roommates walk into the living room. Please remember to stretch before and after! Run by husband-and-wife duo Daniel and Kelli Segers, Fitness Blender is a well-known repository for just about every kind of workout video you can imagine — including easy at-home options that don't require any equipment. Best of all, the clips are music-free, which means you can focus on your 3 Day Flexibility Challenge instead of a 3 Day Flexibility Challenge featuring the Chainsmokers featuring Halsey. Very chill! Yoga instructor Adriene Mishler has built an impressive channel with a wide range of specialized videos. There's yoga for self-care, yoga for service industry workers, yoga for people with sensitive knees — even chair-based yoga designed for seniors. Mishler's presence is calm, friendly, and casual, and the videos are genuinely soothing. Periodically, she also completes themed 30-day yoga challenges, which you can (of course) follow at your leisure. Personal trainer Scola Dondo's workouts provide easy-to-follow instructions, clear visuals, and manageable clip lengths. You'll want to stay for the Tiny Room workout (which works surprisingly well) and the dance workouts, which are fun and fairly easy to follow. She just posted one set to ""Bodak Yellow,"" so... Look past the clickbait-y video titles (par for the course on YouTube), and there's some great stuff here. Marcie offers a wide range of yoga, pilates, and HIIT (high intensity interval training) videos, including workouts specifically designed for pregnant women. Some of the videos are a little more fast-paced than others on this list, but you can always pause and repeat. Plus, Marcie is a badass. Okay, fine, so you want something a little more intense. Consider the videos at Group HIIT, which are fast, intense, equipment-free workouts reminiscent of a group fitness class... but without the other people. The clips are silent except for timers, so you can set them to whatever music you like — or no music at all, if you enjoy the sound of your own ragged breaths. There are also quite a few demo videos in case you aren't familiar with some of the moves. You'll be filled with adrenaline and extremely sweaty in no time.","For the unseasoned athlete, YouTube workouts can be pretty difficult.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"Beside a lack of competition, the investment slump stems from what Summers calls the de-massification of the economy. Developers arent building as many malls and stores, because goods now go straight from warehouses to homes. Offices dont need as much storage space. Cellphones have replaced not just desktop computers but also cameras, stereos, books and more. Many young people have decided theyre happy living in small apartments, without cars.
For all of these economic problems, there are promising solutions. But the United States is not giving those solutions a try.
The 2017 Trump tax law is a useful case study. It is a dreadful piece of economic policy essentially a giant effort to aggravate income inequality. Tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most are huge and permanent. Tax cuts focused on everyone else are smaller and temporary.
But the law still pumped money into the economy last year, thanks largely to those temporary tax cuts for the middle class and poor. And guess what? G.D.P. growth finally met some forecasters expectations, as you can see from the first chart above. The economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2018. Unfortunately, the boost seems to have been temporary. In the first quarter of this year, growth has slowed markedly, probably to about 0.5 percent. It will most likely grow faster over the rest of 2019, but not 3 percent. Once again, economists have started downgrading their expectations.
A better policy response would start with a tax cut focused on the majority of Americans, not the wealthy. And there are many other ways to take on secular stagnation. When I spoke to Summers last week, he rattled off a list: 
Infrastructure projects, to jump-start investment. The retirement of coal-fired power plants, which would also lead to new investment. Stronger safety-net programs, including Social Security, to reduce the savings glut. More aggressive antitrust policies, to combat monopolies. And a Federal Reserve that, at long last, stopped making the same mistake of overestimating both growth and inflation.
After a decade of negative economic surprises, maybe we shouldnt be surprised anymore. Maybe we should try some new solutions.",Traders at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

Ginger Gibson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic state governors say their party needs to challenge President Donald Trump’s record on the economy as he seeks re-election next year, by focusing on middle-class Americans who have not seen the benefits of economic growth. 
Trump believes he has a winning hand with the economy and frequently touts a low unemployment rate, strong growth and stock market gains since his 2016 election victory. 
Democrats, who won ground in gubernatorial elections in 2018, are looking for ways to convert the messages that worked in those state contests into victory in the presidential election in 2020. 
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who defeated incumbent Republican Scott Walker in one of the biggest upsets last year, said the unemployment rate in his state did not reflect the struggles faced by voters. 
“Yes, we have a 3 percent unemployment rate, but we also have 800,000 families that are struggling just to put food on the table. ... We have a long way to go,” Evers said in Washington, where he attended a weekend meeting of Democratic and Republican governors from across the country. 
Trump won Wisconsin by a close margin in the 2016 presidential election, and it is a major target for Democrats in 2020. 
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, elected last year in a state that only narrowly voted Democratic in the 2016 presidential election, said voters in his state are concerned about corporate gains not flowing down to workers. 
“There is no doubt that Minnesotans and Americans are working harder and (are) more productive, but most of that gain has not been seen in the middle class,” Walz said. 
Walz has endorsed U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also elected last year, said Democrats needed to counter Trump’s message by talking about how low wages, expensive health insurance and rising costs are squeezing middle-class voters. 
She said she was concerned about Democrats’ ability to articulate an effective message on the economy and show voters how their own policies encourage investment and well-paid jobs. 
“I do worry. ... If Democrats around the country, including me, are not talking about those precise strategies ... I think we won’t get attention for the economic efforts that we’re making,” she said. 
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who has endorsed U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also of his state, for president, said Democrats should not abandon their message about social issues to talk about the economy. 
“We don’t make economic progress without social progress, and likewise, you don’t make social progress without economic progress,” Murphy said.

Zack Whittaker,"A lot can change in a year. Not when you’re Equifax. The credit rating giant, one of the largest in the world, was trusted with some of the most sensitive data used by banks and financiers to determine who can be lent money. But the company failed to patch a web server it knew was vulnerable for months, which let hackers crash the servers and steal data on 147 million consumers. Names, addresses, Social Security numbers and more — and millions more driver license and credit card numbers were stolen in the breach. Millions of British and Canadian nationals were also affected, sparking a global response to the breach. It was “one of the most egregious examples of corporate malfeasance since Enron,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at the time. Yet, a year on from following the devastating hack that left the company reeling from a breach of almost every American adult, the company has faced little to no action or repercussions. In the aftermath, the company’s response to the breach was chaotic, sending consumers scrambling to learn if they were affected but were instead led into a broken site that was vulnerable to hacking. And when consumers were looking for answers, Equifax’s own Twitter account sent concerned users to a site that easily could have been a phishing page had it not been for a good samaritan. Yet, the company went unpunished. In the end, Equifax was in law as much a victim as the 147 million Americans. “There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers,” said Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, in a call with TechCrunch. Warner, who serves Virginia, was one of the first lawmakers to file new legislation after the breach. Alongside his Democratic colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two senators said their bill, if passed, would hold credit agencies accountable for data breaches. “With Equifax, they knew for months before they reported, so at what point is that violating securities laws by not having that notice?,” said Warner. “There was a failure of the company, but also of lawmakers.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) “The message sent to the market is ‘if you can endure some media blowback, you can get through this without serious long-term ramifications’, and that’s totally unacceptable,” he said. Lawmakers held hearings and grilled the company’s former chief executive, Richard Smith, who retired with his full $90 million retirement package, adding insult to injury. Equifax further shuffled its executive suite, including the hiring of a new chief information security officer Jamil Farshchi and former lawyer turned “chief transformation officer” Julia Houston to oversee “the company’s response to the cybersecurity incident.” Equifax declined to make either executive available for interview or comment when reached by TechCrunch, but Equifax spokesperson Wyatt Jefferies said protecting customer data is the company’s “top priority.” But there’s not much to show for it beyond superficial gestures of free credit monitoring — provided by Equifax, no less — and a credit locking app which, unsurprisingly, had its own flaws. In the year since, the company has spent more than $240 million — some $50 million was covered by cyber-insurance. That’s a drop in the ocean to more than $3 billion in revenue in the year since, according to quarterly earnings filings — or more than $500 million in profits. And although Equifax’s stock price initially collapsed in the weeks following, the price bounced back. Financially, the company looks almost as healthy as it’s ever been. But that may change. Former Equifax chief executive Richard Smith prepares to testify before the lawmakers. Smith later retired after hackers broke into the credit reporting agency and made off with the personal information of nearly 145 million Americans. Earlier this year, the company asked a federal judge to reject claims from dozens of banks and credit unions for costs taken to prevent fraud following the data breach. The claims, if accepted, could force Equifax to shell out tens of millions of dollars — perhaps more. The hundreds of class action suits filed to date have yet to hit the courts, but historically even the largest class action cases have resulted in single dollar amounts for the individuals affected. And when the credit agent giant isn’t fighting the courts, federal regulators have shown little interest in pursuit of legal action. An investigation launched by a former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for protecting consumers from fraud, sputtered after the new director reportedly declined to pursue the company. And, although the company is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for the second time this decade, fines are likely to be limited — if levied at all. Warren sent a letter Thursday to the heads of both agencies lamenting their lack of action. “Companies like Equifax do not ask the American people before they collect their most sensitive information,” said Warren. “This information can determine their ability to access credit, obtain a job, secure a home loan, purchase a car, and make dozens of other transactions that are critical to their personal financial security.” “The American people deserve an update on your investigations,” she said. To date, only the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought charges — not for the breach itself, but against three former staffers for allegedly insider trading. Escaping any local action, Equifax agreed with eight states, including New York and California, to take further cybersecurity steps and measures to prevent another breach, escaping any fines or financial penalties. “The American people deserve an update on your investigations” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Warner blamed much of the inaction to the patchwork of data breach laws that vary by state. “We’ve got different laws and you don’t have any standard, and part of the challenge around the data breach is that every industry wants to be exempted,” said Warner. It’s not a partisan issue, he said, but one where every industry — from telecoms to retail — wants to be exempt from the law. “If we really want to improve our business cyber-hygiene, you have got to have consequences for failing to keep up those cyber-hygiene standards,” he said. It’s a tough sell to posit Equifax, which fluffed almost every step of the breach process, before and after its disclosure, as a victim. While the millions affected can take solace in the beating Equifax got in the press, those demanding regulatory action might be in for a disappointingly long wait.","A lot can change in a year.

TIMOTHY P. CARNEY,"And what is that signal, and what exactly is the discontent that is driving these voters frustration with the governing party? After all, Pennsylvania and Michigan enjoy unemployment of 4 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. Wisconsin has a stellar 3 percent unemployment. Ohio is the worst of the bunch, but still has a historically low 4.6 percent unemployment rate. To understand the discontent, though, you have to look deeper than economic woe. Counties that flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump looked bad on broad measures of well-being, according to one typical study that asked residents about their overall happiness and optimism. Tellingly, counties where respondents were most dissatisfied with the place where they lived were the counties that swung the most from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump. Not surprisingly, the guy who said the American dream is dead overperformed in the crumbling communities where the American dream really was dead. Sawyer County in northwestern Wisconsin, which saw nearly a 20-point swing from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump in 2016, also had the states highest rate of drug overdose deaths that year. Or consider Fayette County, Pa., south of Pittsburgh. Its definitely working class: Only 15 percent of the countys residents over age has a bachelors degree, half the national rate. Mr. Obama and John McCain basically tied in this white, rural county in 2008. In 2016, Mr. Trump won it by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, pulling off a 22-point swing. I visited Uniontown, Fayettes county seat, just before the 2016 election, and found a uniformly pro-Trump clientele at Smittys Bar and Restaurant. I also found widespread alienation. The cliché of small-town rural Americas neighborliness wasnt evident here. Heroin and pills, thats all Fayette County is, one patron told me. I dont talk to none of mine, the bartender said of her neighbors. I got one who lives behind me who I think deals drugs. I got quacks who live below me. I got a loaded.22 right by my door, a man said over his vodka and tonic. I dont trust nobody in my apartment complex. Fayette County posts the sixth lowest social capital score out of Pennsylvanias 67 counties, according to Congresss Joint Economic Committee. The other five rural Pennsylvania counties at the bottom also saw double-digit swings toward Mr. Trump in 2016.",Why is the Rust Belt trending blue for the midterms?

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / Lyft passengers and drivers in a Lyft ride on February 3, 2016 in San Francisco, California. 0 Two Lyft drivers, one in Massachusetts and one in California, have recently filed another pair of proposed class-action lawsuits. Like previous similar cases, the plaintiffs here accuse the ride-hailing company of inadequately paying them, and misclassifying them as contractors, rather than employees. By classifying the bulk of its workforce as contractors, Lyft and other companies like it, are almost certainly saving millions of dollars per year in costs that they would otherwise have to pay, including drivers' health, retirement, unemployment, or other benefits that typically come with full-time employment. The Massachusetts case, Wickberg v. Lyft, was brought earlier this month by a Boston-based attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, who has made a name for herself bringing similar labor lawsuits against gig economy startups in recent years. She lost a key lawsuit, OConnor v. Uber, at the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in late September 2018. In that case, the appellate court found that because Uber drivers had agreed that all disputes would be handled by private arbitration rather than public litigation, the judges didnt have to even reach the contractor versus employee question. But whats different in Wickberg is that this driver explicitly opted out of this arbitration clause of his work agreement, and so Liss-Riordan is arguing that ""he can represent a class of Lyft drivers in court (regardless of whether they have individually opted out of Lyfts arbitration clause.)"" Meanwhile, across the country, plaintiffs lawyers in Whitson v. Lyft, make a very similar argument on behalf of a driver who had also opted out. Crucially, the California plaintiff, Nathaniel Whitson, who filed his case on October 26 in federal court in San Francisco, may have a stronger chance due to a recent California Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Dynamex. There, the Golden States highest court came up with a three-part test to determine whether someone is in fact and employee, or a contractor. (A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact, (B) that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business, and (C) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business, the worker should be considered an employee and the hiring business an employer under the suffer or permit to work standard in wage orders. Because of this precedent, Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings, told Ars that Whitson, as a case, ""seems strong,"" but suggested that the pair of cases have a long way to go. ""Both cases include lead plaintiffs who have opted out of the mandatory arbitration agreement,"" she emailed. ""The hope is to form a large class of drivers who have opted out of the arbitration agreement. If the class is large enough in either case and the plaintiffs win, then it might impact Lyfts business model."" As Ars reported previously, for months now, companies including Lyft have lobbied lawmakers in Sacramento to draft new legislation that would effectively overturn the Dynamex standard. Meanwhile, on the federal level, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has introduced a bill that would codify Dynamex. That bill has, in turn, been opposed by the US Chamber of Commerce. Lyft did not respond to Ars request for comment.","Massachusetts, California lawsuits seek to resolve vexing employee question.",2018-11-02T09:15:17Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Lyft drivers sue, argue that they’re employees rather than contractors",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/lyft-drivers-sue-argue-that-theyre-employees-rather-than-contractors/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-508246182-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-3,1

Brian Benchoff,"There’s a certain class of parts that just can’t be made on a standard 3-axis mill, nor with a 3D printer or a lathe. These parts — weird screws, camshafts, strange gears, or simply a shaft with a keyway (or two) — can really only be made with a rotary axis on a CNC machine. Sure, you could buy a rotary axis for a Haas or Tormach for thousands of dollars, or you could build your own. That’s exactly what [ Adam Zeloof] and [ Matt Martone] did with their project at this year’s World Maker Faire in New York. It’s the Rotomill, a simple three-axis CNC machine, with a rotary axis, that just about anyone can build. The design of the Rotomill uses a standard, off-the-shelf Makita rotary tool for the spindle, and uses leadscrews to move the X and Z axes around with NEMA 24 stepper motors. The A axis — the rotary bit — is driven through a worm gear, also powered by a NEMA 24. Right now this provides more than enough power to cut foam, plastic, and wood, and should be enough to cut aluminum. That last feat is as yet untested, but the design is open enough that a much more powerful spindle could be attached. The software for this machine is a bit weird. For most CNC machines with a rotary axis, the A axis is treated as such — a rotary axis. For the Rotomill, [Adam] and [Matt] are generating G Code like it’s a normal Cartesian machine, only with one axis ‘wrapped’ around itself. This is all done through Autodesk HSM, and a properly configured Arduino running GRBL makes sense of all this arcane geometry. It’s a great looking machine, and the guys behind it say it’s significantly less expensive than any other machine with a rotary axis. That’s to be expected, as it’s basically a five axis mill with two axes removed. Still, this entire project was built for about $2000, and some enterprising salvage and hacking could bring that price down a bit.","There’s a certain class of parts that just can’t be made on a standard 3-axis mill, nor with a 3D printer or a lathe.

NEAL E. BOUDETTE,"The truck is powered by a giant battery under the cab. It has two rear axles, each outfitted with two electric motors, one for each wheel. Because the truck has no engine or transmission, Tesla says it has far fewer moving parts than a diesel truck and will require much less maintenance. In briefings before the event, Tesla declined to disclose critical information about the truck such as its price and its driving range between charges. A Tesla official said the company hoped to offer a production version for sale by the end of 2019. For an electric semi truck, battery range remains a significant question mark. Analysts at Bernstein, an investment bank, estimated that Tesla’s truck would be able to travel 300 to 450 miles a day before needing to recharge its battery pack, while most long-haul trucks cover 500 to 600 miles in a day. “We see 300 to 450 miles a day as a significant constraint,” the bank said in a research report. Tesla is taking on the challenge of electric trucks while struggling with a number of issues in its car business. The company recently introduced its most affordable car, the Model 3, but has run into delays. When Model 3 production started in July at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, Calif., Mr. Musk said he hoped to increase output to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But Tesla had assembled just 260 by the end of September. In a letter to shareholders two weeks ago, Mr. Musk said he hoped to lift production to 5,000 a week early next year. And last month the company fired several hundred workers for what it said was substandard performance, raising further concerns about its ability to meet Mr. Musk’s aggressive manufacturing goals. The Model 3, with a starting price of $35,000, is intended to become Tesla’s top-selling car. The company’s other vehicles — the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X, a sport utility vehicle — sell for $70,000 and up. Last year, Tesla made about 85,000 vehicles, and is on track to make about 100,000 this year. Because the Model 3, with its lower price, will appeal to a wider class of consumers, Mr. Musk is hoping to push sales to more than 500,000 cars in 2018. So far the company has attributed the slow pace of Model 3 output to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system. “I think the electric, autonomous truck market is a very promising proposition,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. “One of my concerns with Tesla is they have way too much on their plate. They can’t overpromise and underdeliver on a truck.” The strain of starting up Model 3 production has taken a toll on Tesla’s bottom line. In the third quarter, the company lost $619.4 million, even as revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion. Aside from running Tesla, Mr. Musk heads the rocket company Space X and a new venture, the Boring Company, which aims to build tunnels for futuristic pods that can carry people at speeds of up to 700 miles per hour. Competitors have already begun testing electric trucks and self-driving technology. Last month, Daimler demonstrated an electric tractor-trailer. Embark, a Silicon Valley start-up, said this week that it had begun using self-driving trucks to transport Frigidaire refrigerators from a warehouse in El Paso to a distribution center 650 miles away in Palm Springs, Calif. While Tesla jumped out ahead of established automakers with its electric cars and technologies like its Autopilot semiautonomous driving system, it faces a much different landscape in trucks, Ms. Krebs said. Tesla doesn’t have experience in the truck market, and it is up against formidable competitors, like Daimler, that have a built-in customer base, she said. “The critical thing with trucks is that it is a work tool,” she added. “It has to work all the time. It’s not like a sports car and I have something else in the garage to drive if it’s in maintenance or whatever.” Continue reading the main story","Aiming to remake a multibillion-dollar industry, the automaker said it would have a semi for sale in two years that would be nearly self-driving.",2017-11-17T04:29:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Tesla Unveils an Electric Rival to Semi Trucks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/business/tesla-electric-truck.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-3,1
nigelroberts1,"I t shouldn’t come as a shock that the intern staff working in the White House is practically all White. The racial composition of the class is a repeat of last year, and 2019 will probably be the same. SEE ALSO: Trump Administration: ‘Black People Need Not Apply’ Many people are criticizing the Trump administration for selecting a spring intern class of 91 participants that includes just a handful of non-Whites. That was expected from an administration that does not value diversity. Still, when the White House released the class photograph on Friday, scores of people took to social media to vent. “The White House intern photo is like a Where’s Waldo for a non-white person—in a country that is about 40% non-white,” tweeted political scientist and Washington Post columnist Brian Klaas. Although it’s obvious to just about everyone, the White House denies publicly that it has a diversity problem. Back in December, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was dishonest when she said the administration has “a really diverse team across the board,” when asked how many senior Black staffers work for the White House. More recently, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came under fire when three senior Interior Department officials alleged that he said several times “diversity isn’t important,” or “I don’t care about diversity,” or “I don’t really think that’s important anymore.” White House staff became notably whiter after the departure of Omarosa Manigualt Newman in December. She was “the only African-American woman who sits at the table,” Newman highlighted to NBC News. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is the only Black voice in Trump’s cabinet. The African-American Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who holds a senior level position in the administration, is also a visible presence.

Shana Lebowitz,"Japan is facing a fertility crisis — and these efforts could help. Carl Court/Getty The Atlantic recently reported on Ikumen classes in Japan, or classes that teach men how to be better fathers. The catch? At least in the session that Atlantic reporter Stephen Marche attended, none of the men in the class were dads or expecting dads. Some weren't even dating anyone. The idea is at least partly to impress women with the fact that they have some fatherhood experience. Men in the class practice bathing fake infants and wear weight suits to simulate a woman's pregnant body — but they also learn other ways of being better husbands and fathers. The teacher in Marche's class recommended that the men compliment their wives (and potential future wives) with comments like: ""This is delicious"" or ""Your outfit looks cute today!"" Those are suggested as alternatives to comments like, ""Why did you sleep in so late?"" A more public spectacle of wife-appreciation is Japan's annual ""Beloved Wives Day,"" in which men stand up in public and shout into a microphone how much they adore their wives. Beloved Wives Day, which has been celebrated in January for about a decade now, is the brainchild of Kiyo Yamana, the founder of the Japan Aisaika Organization. (""Aisaika"" means ""adoring husband."") JAO's ""5 Golden Rules of Devoted Husbands"" are: 1. Go home early, before 8 p.m. 2. Create a relaxing atmosphere 3. Call your wife by her name 4. Look into her eyes 5. Listen to what she has to say As Kiyo's wife, Kimi, told Christiane Amanpour in the CNN series ""Sex and Love Around the World,"" she and Kiyo have abided by these rules since they got married — and they explain why the couple are so happy. Ikumen classes and Beloved Wives Day come at a time when Japan is facing a fertility crisis — or what economists call a ""demographic time bomb."" The Atlantic previously reported that a lack of job opportunities for men could be to blame. Japanese men are still expected to support their families, and both men and women may be reluctant to marry and have children if they know it will be financially difficult. And as Business Insider has previously reported, work in Japan can be so demanding that young people often have no time to date or to start a family. Meanwhile, JAO suspects that the Aisaika lifestyle could be an ""unknown traditional culture of Japan."" The JAO website also reads: ""The Aisaika group has been initiated by middle-aged men who had come to think that good and sustainable marital relationship may very well lead to the world peace and preservation of the global environment.""","Japan has begun offering classes and celebrating holidays that encourage men to appreciate their wives.

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","By Ray Sanchez, CNN Updated 11:30 AM ET, Sun February 18, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. This account of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is based on official statements, interviews with survivors, their relatives and law enforcement officials, as well as other CNN reporting. (CNN) -- On Valentine's Day morning, Nikolas Cruz's 5-foot-7-inch, 120-pound frame couldn't be shaken from his bed in suburban Parkland, Florida. Cruz, 19, lived on a lush street dotted with tropical plants with a family who had opened their home to him after the death of his adoptive parents. The father, James Snead, normally delivered Cruz to his adult GED class on the way to work. Wednesday was different. ""I don't go to school on Valentine's Day,"" the freckle-faced Cruz insisted. At his former high school five miles away, a new day was beginning. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's free breakfast was winding down. The 7:40 a.m. bell signaling the start of first period loomed. The ""daily morning affirmation"" that day on the public school's website came from the late self-help author Louise Hay: ""Life supports me in every way possible."" Lori Alhadeff dropped off her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, at the sprawling campus, home to more than 3,000 students. ""I love you,"" she told Alyssa. That day, teachers collected applications for the National English Honor Society. Members of the tennis teams raised money with the sale of hoodies, yoga pants and other items. Classmates exchanged Valentine's Day carnations sold for $1 in a cafeteria. At lunchtime, some students left $60 deposits for graduation rings. The school day went on as normal. But before the last bell of the day could ring, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School -- whose motto tells students to ""be positive, be passionate"" -- would be the scene of one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. It was no secret to those that knew him that Cruz was fascinated with guns and violence. He posed with guns and knives on Instagram, showed guns to a former classmate and kept a semiautomatic rifle in a lockbox in his room. A former classmate said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a ""school shooter."" The orphaned youth also battled mental illness and depression, his attorneys said later, exacerbated by the recent death of his adoptive mother. She had repeatedly called police to the home to help deal with his violent outbursts. A defense attorney called him ""a broken child."" Cruz eventually made it out of bed that Valentine's Day. He exchanged a number of unremarkable text messages with the son of the family he stayed with and called an Uber. At 2:19 p.m., a gold-colored Uber vehicle dropped him off at the school he once attended. A school employee recognized him. Cruz had been expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons. Now he was back, with a.223-caliber AR-15 rifle concealed in a soft black case. The employee alerted a colleague that the former student was ""walking purposefully"" toward a school building. The school, like many across the US, had made active shooter training drills its protocol. Cruz entered the school building at the east stairwell. He pulled the rifle out of its bag. At some point, Cruz activated a fire alarm. Nicole Baltzer, 18, was in trigonometry class. In 10 minutes, the school day would be over. Why was the fire alarm blaring again? There had been a fire drill earlier in the day. This second one sowed confusion, and students began to scurry from classrooms. Cruz began the massacre, initially targeting people on the first floor. Bursts of semiautomatic fire echoed in the corridors. ""So many shots,"" Baltzer said. ""They were very close."" Freshman Kelsey Friend and her classmates in geography class rushed back into their classroom once they heard the shots. Her teacher, Scott Beigel, 35, unlocked the door for them. There he stood, like a sentry, ushering his students to safety. She thought Beigel would follow her inside. He didn't. The sound of gunfire grew louder. Friend wanted to believe this was just another drill. A more realistic one maybe, with police officers shooting blanks. Other students thought firecrackers were causing the staccato bursts. Then Friend realized this was no drill. Beigel's body crumpled to the floor at the classroom door. Later she would say, ""I am alive today because of him."" The first 911 call came at 2:23 p.m. The shooter's identity was already known. ""I'm being told, advised by the employees, that it should be a student,"" an officer at the school radioed to dispatch. ""Nikolas Cruz, Nikolas Cruz, who came in on campus with a backpack."" Another transmission provided more information: ""I'm being advised by ROTC students that he was kicked out last year. We're still looking for a photo -- he worked at a Dollar Store on Magnolia. Last name spelling is C-R-U-Z."" 'I'm in a school shooting right now' Terrified, the students turned to the familiar: cell phone cameras, text messages, Snapchat and Twitter. They gave the world a glimpse into their horror as it unfolded. Trembling hands. Blood-curdling screams. Bullet-strewn classrooms. Blood-stained floors. Bodies. ""I'm in a school shooting right now."" He hunkered down under a desk in a dark classroom. The shooter stalked the corridors outside. Minutes later, Aidan tweeted again. ""My school is being shot up and I am locked inside. I'm f***ing scared right now."" The tweet included photos of students huddled on the floor. They checked their phones between desks. One appeared to be texting. In 17-year-old Hannah Carbocci's Holocaust history class, a bullet pierced the wall. She thought of her big sister, her protector. Pop-pop! Pop-pop! Screams. More gunshots. Hannah, under a teacher's desk, texted her 19-year-old sister Kaitlin. kaitlin there is a shooter on campus kaitlin i am not joking they just shot through the walls someone in my class is injured 'The Kevlar would slow the bullet down' Assistant coach and security guard Aaron Feis, a graduate of the School, put himself between three students and the shooter, an act of bravery that surprised no one. Feis was shot. He died after he was rushed into surgery. Colton Haab, a 17-year-old junior and football player, would say later, ""That's Coach Feis. He wants to make sure everybody is safe before himself."" As the shots rang out, Haab ushered 60 to 70 people to shelter in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps room. They shielded themselves behind sheets of Kevlar used for Junior ROTC marksmanship practice. ""The Kevlar would slow the bullet down,"" Haab thought. Teacher Melissa Falkowski hid in a large closet with nearly 20 students. She brought them in from the hallway. Some were crying. Other were calling or texting family with words of gratitude and love. Cruz wasn't done. He roamed the first-floor halls before going to the second floor. He shot a victim in another room. On the third floor, he dropped his rifle and bag. He then ran out of the building, blending in with students and staff who were pouring out of the school, many with their hands in the air. Responding officers suspected as much. ""Someone checking the IDs of those kids before they get up and leave the area?"" an officer radioed to dispatch. Later came another transmission: ""Attention all units, be advised -- a repeat of the last instruction -- juveniles being loaded onto the buses are going to park. The IDs need to be checked of the juveniles before they get on the buses. Make sure that Nikolas Cruz isn't part of this group."" 'I knew at that point she was gone' But Cruz slipped away. He bought a drink at a Subway sandwich shop inside a nearby Walmart. Later, he sat at a McDonald's for a few minutes. Police helicopters buzzed overhead. Tearful students reunited outside the school with their parents. Lori Alhadeff, hours after dropping off her daughter Alyssa, raced back to the school when she learned of the shooting. ""I knew at that point she was gone,"" she said. ""I felt it in my heart."" Alyssa didn't make it. Other students remained on lockdown. Not taking chances, some called 911 before letting SWAT teams members enter. ""Student in Classroom 1255 says somebody's pushing on her door -- is that a police officer? Any units pushing on 1255?"" a police dispatcher asked. ""Yes, yes, 1255, that's going to be us,"" an officer responded. ""You want them to open it or do you want me to tell them to stand down?"" ""Tell her to open her door, have her open her door right now!"" As student Masiel Baluja evacuated, she put her book bag on her back just in case she got shot from behind. She ran toward students and teachers. She jumped a fence before police escorted her to a group of students assembled near Walmart. She could see her mother, but Masiel was suspicious of those around her. ""I didn't know if any of them were shooters or not,"" Masiel said later, fighting back tears. ""I felt very uncomfortable because anybody can be a shooter."" 'He looked like a typical high school student' A police officer made contact with Snead, the father who had taken in Cruz after the teen's mother died last fall. Snead said he had spoken with Cruz, who told him he was at the McDonald's near campus. Nearly 80 minutes after the first 911 call, a police officer from nearby Coconut Creek spotted a young man walking along the side of a residential street. The description and clothing matched the shooter's. ""He looked like a typical high school student,"" officer Michael Leonard said. ""For a quick moment I thought, 'Could this be the person? Is this who I need to stop?'"" Leonard pulled over and Cruz, wearing a maroon polo shirt with the school's eagle mascot on the sleeve, surrendered without incident. ""We have the suspect detained,"" came the radio call at 3:41 p.m. The suspect in the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook was caught and 17 people were dead.",It felt like a normal Valentine's Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Then someone noticed a troubled former student carrying a bag and striding purposefully towards a school building.,2018-02-18T16:30:26Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Inside the massacre, moment by moment",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/18/us/parkland-florida-school-shooting-accounts/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180214182416-29-florida-high-school-shooting-0214-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-3,1
Ars Staff,"reader comments 0 Andy Findlay, race pilot for the One Moment Air Race Team, poses with ""Race 30,"" a highly modified 2004 Lancair ""Super Legacy"" (N115YP, L2K-143), at the Hampton Roads Executive Airport (KPVG) in Norfolk, Virginia Andrew Findlay's 2004 Lancair ""Super Legacy"" (N115YP, L2K-143) flies over the Great Dismal Swamp south of the Hampton Roads Executive Airport (KPVG) in Norfolk, Virginia. Findlay bought and fixed a damaged 2004 Lancair Super Legacy to go racing. The prop on his plane is a custom-designed McCauley Blackworks racing propeller. Smaller in diameter than the stock prop, it has been calibrated for blade-bend and spins 200rpm faster (2700-2900rpm) than stock. The engine in the Super Legacy now makes 750hp, more than double the stock output. For the 2018 air race, Findlay is aiming for a 400mph lap. In the summer of 2013, Andy Findlay found himself glancing down from the cockpit of his Lancair Super Legacy sport plane as he passed the start/finish pylon on the race course at Stead Airport, home of the Reno National Championship Air Races. Findlay was flying the famed Reno course for the first time.""It was one of those moments in life where you knew that was exactly where you were supposed to be,"" Findlay says. The Reno Air Races are the only bastion of competitive airplane racing in the world. For 54 years, pilots have raced airplanes there around an oval track in the sky, 50 to 100 feet (15-30m) above the desert at up to 500mph (800km/h). There is no faster head-to-head motorsport. Racing at Reno has long appealed to highly experienced, wealthy warbird owners and others with home-built airplanes. But now, the races are luring a younger group of pilots who are mixing piston-engined powerplants and analog aerodynamics with digitization. They race in the Sport class. One Moment Most of the time you'll find Andrew (Andy) Findlay in Virginia Beach, Virginia where he works as an engineer for Stihl Tools. It's a long way from Reno but he grew up much closer, in McCall, Idaho. Andy first went to the Reno races with his father as a 15-year-old in the 1990s. Already a motorcycle and snowmobile racer, the teenager was inspired. Ironically, one of the race pilots there was motocross racing legend, Bob ""Hurricane"" Hannah. Findlay still has the poster that Hannah signed for him. The similarity between flying and riding motorcycles (which he does regularly) has always fascinated the young engineer. Findlay went to college, got his private pilot's license and got a job. But the idea of air racing never left him. After a few years working as an engineer, he decided to make his dream reality. ""I put my house up for rent and lived with a buddy as cheaply as I could. I started saving money to dedicate everything I could to air racing,"" he told me. The Sport class at Reno is made up of general aviation sport planes—Glasairs, Harmon Rockets, RV-4s, Thunder Mustangs, and Lancairs. A modern and cost-effective alternative to the top Unlimited class of largely ex-WWII fighters, the Sport class is where Findlay would direct his dedication. He found a damaged 2004 Lancair Super Legacy, a popular two-seat, low-wing sport plane. Powered by a six-cylinder, air-cooled, horizontally opposed Continental IO-550 (displacing 550 cubic inches, or 9.0L) with 310 horsepower (231kW) and a 3-blade Hartzell propeller, the Super Legacy has a top speed around 300mph (483km/h) at 8,000 feet (2,438m). Findlay fixed the damage and convinced Reno race pilot and Lancair expert David Robinson to give him transition training in the Super Legacy, despite Findlay not having the 500 hours total flight time required to race at Reno. The training paid off. When Findlay showed up at Reno's Pylon Racing School (PRS)—where novices get race training—in June 2013, he flew the 7.91 mile (12.7km) course with race instructor Lee Behel, who let him do something few newbies are allowed. Behel had confidence enough in Findlay to allow him to make a mid-air pass. (All race passes are made on the outside of the airplane being overtaken.) Making his first overtake on the race course as the two aircraft passed the start/finish pylon prompted Findlay to name his airplane One Moment in honor of that fleeting instant. In September of 2013, it would finally be time to race. Super Legacy At PRS, Findlay had lapped the race course in his stock Lancair at around 310mph (499km/h). That was fast, but not fast enough to keep him from potentially getting lapped by the really fast guys—people like Jeff LaVelle, who won in 2012 with a six-lap average of 393mph (632km/h) and later set a Sport class record at 409 mph (659km/h). Rookie or not, Andy didn't want to get lapped. ""I worked at Evinrude and had a lot of engine development experience so it was game-on to try to make this thing go fast,"" he said. In two and a half months, Andy and a volunteer crew added improved twin-turbochargers and water-methanol anti-detonation injection (ADI), allowing them to raise engine manifold pressure and boost. With significantly more power, Findlay qualified One Moment at 347.122mph (558.640km/h). He would race his way to fifth overall with a six-lap race average of 351.084mph (565.014km/h) and be nominated rookie of the year. He was never lapped. Andy has returned to race every year since, achieving a best finish of third overall in 2015. He's progressively modified One Moment, now sponsored by Stihl Tools. Its Continental engine makes 750 horsepower (559kW)—more than twice the stock rating—thanks to a pair of custom Turbonetics 76mm turbochargers (one for each bank), sophisticated ADI, and a system which employs spray bars to spray coolant on the cylinders. The hot-rodded IO-550 runs 75-plus inches of manifold pressure (3-bar of boost, or 25-30 PSI). The engine is paired to a custom-designed McCauley Blackworks racing propeller. Smaller in diameter than the stock prop, it has been calibrated for blade-bend and also spins 200rpm faster (2700-2900rpm). Aerodynamically, One Moment's airfoils and bodywork have been thoroughly smoothed, eliminating rough spots. The fuselage has been slightly widened behind the wing to keep airflow attached to the empennage (that is, the collective tail assembly). A cockpit with digital engine management from Simple Digital Systems allows Andy to operate the fuel-injected engine without worrying about mixture or boost settings. Custom avionics from Dynon Skyview allow Findlay to see engine parameters, from water-methanol pressures to intake air temperature. The technology is impressive, and wide-open Sport class rules mean there's much more performance to be extracted from the airplanes which populate the race field. Still, it's the combination of pilot and preparation that wins races. Fangs out Air racing isn't like auto racing. If you blow your engine or lose a control surface, you can't just pull off the track. You have to land, and often, protect your own life. That's why the Reno air racing community is known as the ""September Family."" No matter how hard you race another pilot wingtip-to-wingtip, safety comes first. Every pilot relies on his crew and the other pilots and crews to a degree beyond most motorsports. ""In airplanes, rubbing's not racing,"" Andy observes. ""To be flying that close to somebody around the course, you really have to truly trust those people. We practice a lot. But at the end of the day it is racing, so the fangs do come out. We're pushing the engines to the max. I've broken a couple. I'm pushing that throttle in as hard as I can and trying to catch the guy in front of me."" Findlay is shooting for a 400mph (644km/h) lap at this year's Reno Races in September, playing to win outright against 35 other Sport class race pilots. To do it, he'll have to get everything right in one moment.

More about Ahmed…
In this tutorial, well use the latest versions of Bootstrap 4 and Angular 7 to build an Angular application and style the interface with Bootstrap. Well make use of some new BS4 features to display data.
In case youve already tried building a web application with Angular 7, its time to kick it up a notch. Lets see how we can integrate Bootstrap CSS styles and JavaScript files with an Angular project generated using the Angular CLI, and how to use form controls and classes to create beautiful forms and how to style HTML tables using Table styles.
For the Angular part, well be creating a simple client-side application for creating and listing contacts. Each contact has an ID, name, email, and description, and well be using a simple data service that stores the contacts in a TypeScript array. You can use an advanced in-memory API instead. (Check out A Complete Guide To Routing In Angular.)
Note: You can get the source code of this tutorial from this GitHub repository and see the live example over here.
Requirements
Before we start creating the demo application, lets see the requirements needed for this tutorial.
Basically, you will need the following:
Node.js and NPM installed (you can simply head on over to the official website and download the binaries for your system),
Familiarity with TypeScript,
Working experience of Angular,
Basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
Web forms are such an important part of the web, but we design them poorly all the time. The brand-new Form Design Patterns book is our new practical guide for people who design, prototype and build all sorts of forms for digital services, products and websites. The eBook is free for Smashing Members.
Check the table of contents 
Installing Angular CLI
Lets start by installing the latest version of Angular CLI. In your terminal, run the following command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
At the time writing, v7.0.3 of Angular CLI is installed. If you have the CLI already installed, you can make sure you have the latest version by using this command:
$ ng --version
Creating A Project
Once you have Angular CLI installed, lets use it to generate an Angular 7 project by running the following command:
$ ng new angular-bootstrap-demo
The CLI will then ask you:
Would you like to add Angular routing?
Press Y. Next, it will ask you:
Which stylesheet format would you like to use?
Choose CSS.
Adding Bootstrap
After creating the project, you need to install Bootstrap 4 and integrate it with your Angular project.
First, navigate inside your projects root folder:
$ cd angular-bootstrap-demo
Next, install Bootstrap 4 and jQuery from npm:
$ npm install --save bootstrap jquery
(In this case, bootstrap v4.2.1 and jquery v3.3.1 are installed.)
Finally, open the angular.json file and add the file paths of Bootstrap CSS and JS files as well as jQuery to the styles and scripts arrays under the build target:
""architect"": {
 ""build"": {
 [...], 
 ""styles"": [
 ""src/styles.css"", 
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css""
 ],
 ""scripts"": [
 ""node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"",
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js""
 ]
 },
Check out how to add Bootstrap to an Angular 6 project for options on how to integrate Bootstrap with Angular.
Adding A Data Service
After creating a project and adding Bootstrap 4, well create an Angular service that will be used to provide some demo data to display in our application.
In your terminal, run the following command to generate a service:
$ ng generate service data
This will create two src/app/data.service.spec.ts and src/app/data.service.ts files.
Open src/app/data.service.ts and replace its contents with the following:
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
 providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
contacts = [
 {id: 1, name: ""Contact 001"", description: ""Contact 001 des"", email: ""c001@email.com""},
 {id: 2, name: ""Contact 002"", description: ""Contact 002 des"", email: ""c002@email.com""},
 {id: 3, name: ""Contact 003"", description: ""Contact 003 des"", email: ""c003@email.com""},
 {id: 4, name: ""Contact 004"", description: ""Contact 004 des"", email: ""c004@email.com""}
 ];
constructor() { }
public getContacts():Array&lt;{id, name, description, email}&gt;{
 return this.contacts;
 }
 public createContact(contact: {id, name, description, email}){
 this.contacts.push(contact);
 }
}
We add a contacts array with some demo contacts, a getContacts() method which returns the contacts and a createContact() which append a new contact to the contacts array.
Adding Components
After creating the data service, next we need to create some components for our application. In your terminal, run:
$ ng generate component home
$ ng generate component contact-create
$ ng generate component contact-list
Next, well add these components to the routing module to enable navigation in our application. Open the src/app/app-routing.module.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { ContactListComponent } from './contact-list/contact-list.component';
import { ContactCreateComponent } from './contact-create/contact-create.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
const routes: Routes = [
 {path: """", pathMatch: ""full"",redirectTo: ""home""},
 {path: ""home"", component: HomeComponent},
 {path: ""contact-create"", component: ContactCreateComponent},
 {path: ""contact-list"", component: ContactListComponent} 
];
@NgModule({
 imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
 exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
We use the redirectTo property of the routers path to redirect users to the home page when they visit our application.
Next, lets create the header and footer components:
$ ng generate component header
$ ng generate component footer
Open the src/app/header/header.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;nav class=""navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""navbar-brand"" href=""#""&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;button class=""navbar-toggler"" type=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#navbarCollapse"" aria-controls=""navbarCollapse""
 aria-expanded=""false"" aria-label=""Toggle navigation""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""navbar-toggler-icon""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;div class=""collapse navbar-collapse"" id=""navbarCollapse""&gt;
 &lt;ul class=""navbar-nav mr-auto""&gt;
&lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/home""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-list""&gt;Contacts&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-create""&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
A navigation bar will be created with Bootstrap 4, and well use the routerLink directive to link to different components.
Use the .navbar, .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} and .navbar-dark classes to create Bootstrap navigation bars. (For more information about nav bars, check out Bootstraps documentation on Navbar.
Next, open the src/app/header/header.component.css file and add:
.nav-item{
 padding:2px;
 margin-left: 7px;
}
Next, open the src/app/footer/footer.component.html file and add:
&lt;footer&gt;
 &lt;p class=""text-xs-center""&gt;© Copyright 2019. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
Open the src/app/footer/footer.component.css file and add:
footer {
 position: absolute;
 right: 0;
 bottom: 0;
 left: 0;
 padding: 1rem;
 text-align: center;
}
Next, open the src/app/app.component.html file and replace its contents with the following:
&lt;app-header&gt;&lt;/app-header&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
&lt;app-footer&gt;&lt;/app-footer&gt;
Were creating an application shell by using the header and footer components which means that they will be present on every page of our application. The only part that will be changed is what will be inserted in the router outlet (check out The Application Shell on the Angular website for more information).
Adding A Bootstrap Jumbotron
According to the Bootstrap docs:
A Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.
Lets add a Jumbotron component to our home page. Open the src/app/home/home.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""jumbotron"" style=""background-color: #fff; height: calc(95vh);""&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p class=""lead""&gt;
 This demo shows how to integrate Bootstrap 4 with Angular 7 
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a class=""btn btn-lg btn-primary"" href="""" role=""button""&gt;View tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The .jumbotron class is used to create a Bootstrap Jumbotron.
Adding A List Component: Using A Bootstrap Table
Now lets create a component-to-list data from the data service and use a Bootstrap 4 table to display tabular data.
First, open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.ts file and inject the data service then call the getContacts() method to get data when the component is initialized:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-list',
 templateUrl: './contact-list.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-list.component.css']
})
export class ContactListComponent implements OnInit {
contacts;
 selectedContact;
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 this.contacts = this.dataService.getContacts(); 
 }
 public selectContact(contact){
 this.selectedContact = contact;
 }
}
We added two variables contactsand selectedContact which hold the set of contacts and the selected contact. And a selectContact() method which assigns the selected contact to the selectedContact variable.
Open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
 &lt;table class=""table table-hover""&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr *ngFor=""let contact of contacts""&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ contact.id }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.name }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.email }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" (click)=""selectContact(contact)""&gt; Show details&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card text-center"" *ngIf=""selectedContact""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-header""&gt;
 # {{selectedContact.id}}
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-block""&gt;
 &lt;h4 class=""card-title""&gt;{{selectedContact.name}}&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p class=""card-text""&gt;
 {{selectedContact.description}}
 &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We simply loop through the contacts array and display each contact details and a button to select a contact. If the contact is selected, a Bootstrap 4 Card with more information will be displayed.
This is the definition of a Card from Bootstrap 4 docs:
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youre familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
We use the .table and .table-hover classes to create Bootstrap-styled tables, the .card, .card-block, .card-title and .card-text classes to create cards. (For more information, check out Tables and Cards.)
Adding A Create Component: Using Bootstrap Form Controls And Classes
Lets now add a form to our contact-create component. First, we need to import the FormsModule in our main application module. Open the src/app/app.module.ts file, import FormsModule from @angular/forms, and add it to the imports array:
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
/* ... */
@NgModule({
 declarations: [
 /* ... */
 ],
 imports: [
 BrowserModule,
 AppRoutingModule,
 FormsModule
 ],
 providers: [],
 bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-create',
 templateUrl: './contact-create.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-create.component.css']
})
export class ContactCreateComponent implements OnInit {
contact : {id, name, description, email} = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 }
createContact(){
 console.log(this.contact);
 this.dataService.createContact(this.contact);
 this.contact = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
}
}
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
&lt;div class=""col-sm-8 offset-sm-2""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;form&gt;
 &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
 &lt;label for=""id""&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.id"" type=""text"" name=""id"" class=""form-control"" id=""id"" aria-describedby=""idHelp"" placeholder=""Enter ID""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""idHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts ID&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""name""&gt;Contact Name&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.name"" type=""text"" name=""name"" class=""form-control"" id=""name"" aria-describedby=""nameHelp"" placeholder=""Enter your name""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""nameHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts name&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""email""&gt;Contact Email&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.email"" type=""text"" name=""email"" class=""form-control"" id=""email"" aria-describedby=""emailHelp""
 placeholder=""Enter your email""&gt;
 &lt;small id=""nameHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts email&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;label for=""description""&gt;Contact Description&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;textarea [(ngModel)]=""contact.description"" name=""description"" class=""form-control"" id=""description"" aria-describedby=""descHelp""&gt;
 &lt;/textarea&gt;
 &lt;small id=""descHelp"" class=""form-text text-muted""&gt;Enter your contacts description&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" (click)=""createContact()""&gt;Create contact&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We use the .form-group, .form-control classes to create a Bootstrap-styled form (check out Forms for more information).
We use the ngModel directive to bind the form fields to the components’ variable. For data binding to properly work, you need to give each form field a name.

We Are The Mighty,"The first Zumwalt-class destroyer, USS Zumwalt, DDG-1000, in the North Atlantic, Dec. 7, 2015. Jeff Head/Flickr Communist China's People's Liberation Army Navy is a likely opponent on the high seas for the US Navy. China has been pursuing a rapid naval modernization over the last 15 years. A fight between the two of them would depend on who sees the other first. Let's face it, while Russia and the United States are potential adversaries, they're not very likely to fight it out on the high seas. This is mostly because the Russian Navy is a bit of a basket case. But there is a more likely opponent on the high seas for the United States Navy: Communist China's People's Liberation Army Navy. Communist China has been pursuing a rapid naval modernization over the last 15 years. As a result, we've seen a number of modern guided-missile destroyers emerge as the backbone of the People's Liberation Army Navy. While Communist China calls the three major iterations the Type 52B/C/D, NATO calls them the Luyang I/II/III. So, how would one of the most modern Chinese Communist destroyers fare in a one-on-one fight with a Zumwalt- class destroyer? The Luyang III is a formidable opponent. It has two 32-cell vertical-launch systems for the HHQ-9 surface-to-air missile (a Chinese copy of the Russian SA-10/SA-N-6 Grumble surface-to-air missile), YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, a 130mm gun, a 30mm close-in weapon system, torpedo tubes, and a launcher with 24 HHQ-10 missiles. It displaces 8,000 tons and has a top speed in excess of 30 knots. A boarding team from the People's Liberation Army (Navy) Haikou (DD 171) makes way toward the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Waesche (WMSL 751) July, 16, 2014, during a Maritime Interdiction Operations Exercise (MIOEX) as part of Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise 2014. US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 3rd Class Manda M. Emery The YJ-18s will be the Luyang III's primary weapon against a Zumwalt. These missiles have a range of 290 nautical miles and can hit a speed of Mach 3 on their final approach. The Zumwalt, though, carries its own heavy firepower - two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems and 20 four-cell Mk 57 vertical launch systems capable of carrying Tomahawk cruise missiles or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles. Its stealth technology also makes it hard to see. Ultimately, as was the case when we pitted the Zumwalt against a Kirov -class battlecruiser, it will come down to which ship sees the other first. The big difference is that the YJ-18 doesn't have the oomph of the SS-N-19 Shipwrecks aboard the Kirov. With a number of options for her 155mm guns, like Vulcano rounds or Copperhead laser-guided shells, the Zumwalt could do some serious damage to the Luyang III. When the fight is over, the Zumwalt will likely make its way to a friendly port to repair damages, but the Chinese ship could very well be on the bottom of the South China Sea. The winner of this naval skirmish would likely be the American vessel.",Jeff Head/Flickr Communist China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy is a likely opponent on the high seas for the US Navy.

Rather than fielding a question that you’ve emailed me, left in the comments, or tweeted at me (with a GIF), I’m going to solicit your help with a little issue I’ve been having.

Looking for advice on apps, browser extensions, or utilities you can use to accomplish a particular task? Let us know! Tell us in the comments below or, better yet, email david.murphy@lifehacker.com. The pledge I rent a room in a house—ah, Bay Area life —and one of my overlords is a former networking engineer for one of those companies here in the area. In other words, he knows his stuff. But I’ve encountered a perplexing issue with my room’s networking setup that we haven’t pinned down yet. And we’d prefer to find an easy solution before we start having to lay new Ethernet cable through the wall or anything crazy like that. The basics are as follows: The house’s business-class Comcast Internet service ( it’s Comcastic! ) runs through his server, which handles all the routing. A multi-port gigabit switch connects to that, and all of the house’s gigabit Ethernet connections run through the switch. Easy. We recently upgraded our Comcast service to from 50 to 150 Mbps. That’s an important detail, because when I was checking the service from my Ethernet-connected desktop computer, I noticed I was only getting around 80–90 Mbps, not the 150–160 Mbps said landlord was finding on his tests. We repeated these tests across a number of days and times just to make sure there weren’t any weird network congestion issues affecting the speed results, and I consistently found that I could never break past 100 Mbps, whereas he could on pretty much every test he ran. Hmm. Dear Lifehacker, I haven't moved in several years, and I'm still using the cable modem… Read more Read A bit about my room’s setup: I have two Ethernet jacks in the wall, both of which are connected to the house’s primary switch by separate Cat 5e or Cat 6 Ethernet cables. (I believe two Cat 6 cables, but I’m not positive and my roommates are watching the season finale of Westworld so I’m not going to go run out and ask at the moment.) I connect a 16-port Gigabit switch to one wall jack, and all of my room’s devices are connected to switch—all using Cat 5e cables that aren’t likely longer than ten feet each. The Turn Here’s where it gets stranger. Every other gigabit device I connect to the switch keeps its gigabit connection without issue—the lights on the front of the switch make that abundantly clear. And no matter what port I use on the switch when I’m connecting it to the Ethernet jack in the wall, I get gigabit Ethernet... at first. And I can verify this by running a quick fast.com test on my desktop PC: 150–160 Mbps, typically. After anywhere from a few hours to a day, at most, the connection drops to Fast Ethernet speeds—100 Mbps max. The “You’re gigabit’in” light on the front of the switch flips off, my fast.com tests slow to around 80 Mbps, and I sigh. It gets weirder. When I plug an access point directly into that same wall jack—a Google Wifi device running in bridge mode—it never drops the gigabit connection. If I unplug the ethernet cable from the switch and plug it back in to that port, or any port on the switch, I immediately get a Gigabit connection back (until it drops back down however many hours later). If I restart the switch, same deal. If I use another brand-new gigabit switch from a completely different manufacturer, I’ll still lose my precious 1000 Mbps connection eventually. If I use the other wall jack in any of the circumstances I just mentioned, same deal. The prestige? There’s still a little more troubleshooting I should do—perhaps trying a different port on the house’s primary switch that my room’s two Ethernet ports connect to. At worst, maybe something has gone wrong with the Ethernet cables running through the house. Though, it’s strange that whatever issue would affect two ports (or two cables) when every other wired connection in the house seems just fine. Wi-Fi provides a convenient way to connect the computers in your home without dealing with the… Read more Read I suppose I could also try plugging my access point into the wall and connecting the switch to that, but now we’re just getting silly. I could also just use a timer to reset my switch every single day at 3 a.m. or something, but that’s also a little annoying—and still not a guarantee that I’ll have gigabit Ethernet when I wake up. I could also replace the wall jacks themselves, but, again, it seems odd that two would be causing the exact same issue. What do you think? Have I missed anything obvious?

Chaim Gartenberg,"As is practically tradition, HMD Global has come to Mobile World Congress with a new lineup of Nokia phones, and this years group includes budget devices with some clever new features.
That starts with the Nokia 4.2, a new class of phone for the company designed to slot in between the pricier Nokia 5 line and the cheaper Nokia 3. The 4.2 is meant to offer an affordable flagship experience, with premium features like a notched 5.71-inch display, glass front and back design, dual camera system, and a fingerprint sensor without breaking the $200 mark.
The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 processor, so its definitely not the fastest device around. Its rounded out by a 3,000 mAh battery and either 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage or 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage. 
But the most interesting part of the Nokia 4 is its buttons. Theres a dedicated Google Assistant button, which Nokia is loading with a few tricks: press it once to trigger the Assistant, twice to bring up Googles Visual Snapshot view, and press and hold to keep the mic open for a conversational, always listening mode like on a full smart speaker. 
Theres also a breathing notification light integrated into the power button. If the device is face down, the light will gently glow when you have new notifications, which is a clever feature. The Nokia 4 will cost either $169 or $199 depending on the storage configuration, although Nokia isnt sure yet which configurations will come to the US when the phone launches in April. 
Nokia 3.2
Next is the Nokia 3.2, an updated version of the 3.1 thats getting the same dedicated Google Assistant and glowing power buttons, a larger 6.26-inch notched display, and a beefy 4,000 mAh battery. 
The 3.2 has the same Snapdragon 439 processor and 2GB RAM / 16GB storage and 3GB RAM / 32GB storage options as the 4.2. But the 3.2 does lack a few of the 4.2s nicer features, like the glass back (its plastic, instead) and the fingerprint sensor. It is a bit cheaper though, set to cost $169 and $139, depending on the storage/RAM option. Like the Nokia 4.2, the Nokia 3.2 will also launch in April. 
Nokia 1
HMD is also announcing the $99 Nokia 1 Plus, which is meant to improve upon last years Nokia 1 as a sort of entry-level smartphone for folks looking to upgrade from a feature phone for the first time. 
It features a 5.45-inch 18:9 display, removable back cover with replaceable battery, and is thinner than last years model. Crucially, itll also run Android 9 Pie Go, instead of the larger Android 9 Pie, and will be available in early March.
Nokia 210
Lastly, theres the Nokia 210, a proper, classic Nokia feature phone. As you might expect, the specs here are nothing to be amazed by: a 2.4-inch QVGA display and 16MB of memory. But, it also does have Snake, physical keys, a removable 1,020mAh battery, an FM radio, and even an app store (for apps designed for Nokias proprietary, Java-based feature phone OS). Itll cost $35 when it comes out later this year.","As is practically tradition, HMD Global is at MWC 2019 with a new lineup of its Nokia phones, spanning the range from budget Android options to featurephones that are designed to offer new options along the company’s entire range.",2019-02-24T15:30:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Nokia bets big on buttons with its new budget phones,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18236618/nokia-4-3-1-plus-210-buttons-google-assistant-mwc-2019,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkHBj4MrmrUtyaSdIig3Rm0viJI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130573/bfarsace_190210_3229_0029.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-3,1
Andrew J. Hawkins,"Honda revealed more details Wednesday about the all-electric city car it first revealed back in 2017. One surprise: apparently the first version we saw, the Urban EV, was actually a prototype to the prototype; this latest version, dubbed the Honda e Prototype, will make its debut at the Geneva Motor Show next week. And as you can see, it’s still cute. a range of over 200 km (124 miles) This adorably retro vehicle will go into production later this year, after which it will be available for purchase first in Europe, followed by other markets, Honda says. When that happens, the vehicle will be Honda’s first compact car on a dedicated EV platform. Honda claims it will deliver a range of over 200 km (124 miles) and a “fast charge” functionality of 80 percent battery charge in 30 minutes. We don’t have much else in terms of specs, but the interior is now looking more finished, and still retains that retro futuristic charm that is sure to appeal to a lot of car buyers. Inside, three separate screens make up the instrument cluster and infotainment unit. Honda describes the interior: To keep occupants engaged with their connected lifestyles, the intuitive and customizable dual screen horizontal display features a range of intelligent applications and services. This sophisticated high-end interface has been designed for ultimate usability and shifts the car beyond being a means of transportation to become fully integrated into modern everyday life. Other design elements include flush “pop out” door handles and compact cameras replacing traditional side view mirrors. We’ve seen this before with Audi’s E-tron electric SUV, as well as a raft of electric concepts and pre-production models like Byton and Faraday Future. Still, Honda insists both the door handles and camera system “are unique features for a vehicle in this class.” The car’s charging port is situated centrally in the bonnet under the front hood for ease of use from either side of the car, with LED lighting visible through the glass cover. Without a price or other key specs, it’s hard to say with whom exactly Honda’s EV will compete Earlier today, Volvo sub-brand Polestar unveiled its first all-electric vehicle, the Polestar 2, billed as a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. Without a price or other key specs, it’s hard to say with whom exactly Honda’s EV will compete, but based on its design and range, it seems like more of a direct rival to Daimler-owned Smart and its forthcoming electric Forease compact city car. Time will tell. While Honda has just started to offer the Clarity EV in the US and Japan, the company once known as a pioneer of hybrids has fallen behind rivals such as Nissan in the electrification stakes. The city car is supposed to represent a clean start and indicate a fresh direction for Honda. Euro-based journalists got their first look of the new prototype this week. Here’s some videos to give you a flavor of what we’ll being seeing at the Geneva Auto Show next week.","Honda revealed more details Wednesday about the all-electric city car it first revealed back in 2017.

McKinlay also called out the inherent misogyny of many school dress codes by questioning whether the male administrator also punished male students for wearing shorts. ""Sexism. Victim blaming. Girl shaming,"" McKinlay wrote. ""This administrator should be suspended."" Forest Hill High School Principal Mary Stratos told the Palm Beach Post the school forbids students from wearing ""ripped jeans and other torn clothing."" The typical punishment for a first offense is usually a lunch detention, Stratos said. It's unknown whether this was the first time McKinlay's daughter violated the dress code. Stratos also said the school's dress code is ""gender-neutral"" and equally enforced for both male and female students. In a follow-up Facebook post, McKinlay said she spoke with Stratos and other school board members and was ""quite confident they are addressing the situation."" ""As a strong advocate for women, and particularly survivors of sexual assault, the message that somehow a woman's wardrobe is responsible for a man's behavior is wrong,"" McKinlay wrote. ""In any form. And I am hopeful this will be used as an opportunity to provide further sensitivity training to staff and students. ""My daughter indeed violated her school's dress code and she will bear the consequences of that,"" McKinlay added. ""But such a violation never warrants the experience she had yesterday.""
