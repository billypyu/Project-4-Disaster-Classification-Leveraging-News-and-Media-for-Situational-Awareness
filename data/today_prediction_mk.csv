140,another iphone day is now behind u and even the most skeptical apple fan might be asking themselves wa that it we got three new iphones and a new apple watch that s it to be reasonable  is an off year for apple it s an s year a time when the company bump spec rather than completely overhauling it iphones apple announced two new iphones with an s after the name the iphone x and the iphone x max the third device is called the iphone xr which represents a new naming scheme and might be the most interesting of the bunch and again being reasonable the apple watch did get it first ever redesign everything apple announced this year still seems a little underwhelming though despite the fact that the sheer number of new spec seems a little bit overwhelming however apple failed to announce a lot of thing that a lot of people expected including a new ipad pro with face id a cheap macbook and a release date for it long awaited airpower charging pad oh well let s break down what apple did announce apple iphone x this is the one that had to happen a year after apple revealed the iphone x before letting everyone know that it wasn t quite ready for primetime the company announced a solid update to the first face id enabled device the iphone x look almost identical to it predecessor there s the same   inch oled display that stretch fill up nearly the entire span of the iphone s screen which come encased in stainless steel and what apple call the most durable front glass ever in a smartphone what s left is the now famous notch which house the same face id hardware a before but apple say that new software make face id faster than before the oled display itself is also supposed to show  percent greater dynamic range in hdr photo the real gut update of the iphone x is a new a bionic processor that come in the form of apple s first  nanometer chip the new processor come with a six core fusion architecture including two performance core that apple say are  percent faster there s also a four core gpu that s supposedly  percent faster and an eight core neural engine that can handle  trillion operation per second compared to the a bionic processor s  billion those are all apple s bragging number so we ll have to test it out in processor hungry environment like game and augmented reality to see if the improvement make a difference many trillion of process per second sure sound impressive though the other noteworthy upgrade included with the iphone x involves the camera on the outside the new iphone dual camera system look a lot like it predecessor but the component have been updated there are two new  megapixel sensor on the rear camera that are faster and include larger pixel a well a a new true tone flash module meanwhile the new a bionic chip offer better image processing including improved low light performance and portrait mode the new iphone x come in space grey silver and an all new gold finish you can choose between a gb gb and a new gb model price start at   pre order start friday september  and the device ship on friday september  apple iphone x max this new iphone represents a familiar trick it s just the iphone x but bigger the size is notable for a couple of reason though first apple released the iphone x in only one size   inch second the iphone x max s   inch display is the biggest apple ha ever released for an iphone the device itself is about the same size a an iphone  plus but it incorporates the same bezel free design a the iphone x and iphone x that mean it come with face id a well a all the same hardware upgrade a the iphone x including the a bionic processor improved camera and gb storage option based on apple s presentation however the only thing that the iphone x max offer besides the bigger screen is a bigger battery apple say it s the biggest one it s ever offered on an iphone the iphone x max come in all the same color and storage option a the iphone x the device start at   and ship alongside the iphone x apple iphone xr this one s kinda kooky earning the famous one more thing billing at the apple event the iphone xr look a lot like the   inch iphone x except it s a little bit bigger and a lot cheaper it also come in many color the iphone xr come with a   inch lcd display that come in the familiar notched design wrapped up in an aluminum frame and the new more durable glass it s notched because this iphone ha face id and no home button just like it pricier sibling apple call the new lcd a liquid retina display that s supposed to look better than it predecessor the iphone xr also lack a second rear camera but apple found a way to pull off portrait mode using software thanks to the a bionic processor which is included in this cheaper model so the iphone xr is a lot like the iphone x except it ha an lcd screen an aluminum frame and only one camera that doesn t sound so bad when you consider the fact that this device start at   which is cheaper than the launch price of the iphone  the iphone  now start at   and the iphone  start at   you can also get the iphone xr in six pretty color white black blue yellow and coral unfortunately you will have to wait for this intriguing cheaper iphone the iphone xr will be available for preorder on october  and will hit store on october  apple watch series  this one is exciting for lover of subtle design upgrade and heart health the apple watch series  come with a thinner case a larger screen and a new heart rate sensor that can also do electrocardiogram ecg also it know if you fall down the fourth generation apple watch is

141,apple highly anticipated celebrity studded service event didnt disappoint in two specific regard one there were a lot of celebrity present two there were also a lot of new service announced it hard to say which wa more exciting in a way the celebrity were an afterthought apple opened the event with several major upgrade to existing apps and service starting with a new magazine and newspaper subscription offering called apple news then came a new apparently very slick credit card called the apple card there also an entirely new gaming service called apple arcade then the new apple tv app and the completely new apple tv service which wa the part all the celebrity talked about it wa a weird apple event if only because there never really been one like it while it weirdly felt like an award ceremony at timeswith hollywood a lister patting themselves and apple on the back for doing great thingssome of the new apple service look pretty cool let talk through them apple news tim cook opened up the event with a cute little story about how he like going to the newsstand and looking at all the magazine cover this is quaint because it increasingly hard to find a newsstand which is probably why apple talked about enlisting over  magazinesincluding national geographic popular science billboard the new yorker sport illustrated new york magazine and varietyfor it new apple news program apple news will show up a a new tab in the apple news app the new tab essentially look like a redesigned version of texture a digital magazine subscription service that apple acquired last year apple news is pretty straightforward for   a month you get access to all those magazine a well a some newspaper including the los angeles time and the wall street journal you will not get access to the new york time or the washington post apparently because apple wanted to keep half of the subscription fee apple news will work on the iphone ipad a well a the mac apple also say the new subscription service will not allow advertiser to track what you read and target ad accordingly apple news will be available through a software update later today you can get a free one month trial once you update and again it   a month after that you do get family sharing for up to six member included for that price which make the whole thing pretty darn cheap if youre a family of six people who love to read apple card tim cook say that apple pay is incredibly successful so successful that apple is expanding it by offering it own credit card with help from goldman sachs for now the new apple card will only exist in digital form inside of apple wallet and will let you it through apple pay a physical card made of titanium will be available later this summer it all white with a little apple logo on it but wont have your name or credit card number or anything to ensure your privacy this information will be available in the apple wallet app the new apple card actually sound a lot like a regular credit card you do get some reward  percent cash back apple call this daily cash on apple purchase  percent on other purchase and  percent on purchase made with the physical card you also get some tool within the wallet app that help you track and categorize your spending a well a make smart decision when it come to making payment notably there are no annual fee no late fee no hidden fee no international fee no over the limit fee according to apple no fee a the fine print on apple website point out however missing payment will lead to increased interest charge our friend over at lifehacker say it a pretty average reward card and were inclined to agree the apple card will be available later this summer you can sign up to get notified about availability on apple website apple arcade because march wouldnt be complete without another video game service announcement apple just gave u a preview of apple arcade the name is actually handily descriptive because the service is basically a whole section of game built just for apple device and only available on apple device to be more specific apple arcade will become a new section of the app store and for a fee youll get access to over  exclusive title made by some of the top studio there will even be a sonic the hedgehog game and a new version of frogger another cool thing about apple arcade is that all the game work offline so you can play on a plane or the subway the game also work on different platform so you can start playing on an iphone and then pick up where you left off with an apple tv device apple arcade game will be ad free and wont have any in app purchase a far a how much the service itself will cost however we dont yet know apple say the service will go live this fall and will cost money you will also get family sharing for up to six people included in the price apple tv and apple tv okay these were technically two separate announcement but were rolling them into one section here because it otherwise confusing basically apple is updating the apple tv app thats already on million of io and apple tv device apple is also making a version of the apple tv app available for mac a well a a bunch of smart tv platform made by company like samsung and lg on top of that apple will also make apple tv apps for set top box from roku and amazon apple tv is a whole new thing on top of the new apple tv some might even say it wa the star of today event since announcing all of the new show and celebrity involved took like an hour and a half the new paid subscription video service appears to resemble an hbo competitor more than say netflix it will live in the new apple tv app the exclusive programming frankly sound pretty cool there a steven spielberg led reboot of the sci fi series amazing story a comedy about a tv morning news show starring reese witherspoon jennifer aniston and steve carrell something called sea with jason momoa and alfre woodard that sound simply trippy the way momoa described it at the event and little america a show about immigrant and child of immigrant produced by kumail nanianji those are just to name a few oh and ophrah is going to do a couple of documentary again apple declined to offer any detail about exactly how much apple tv would cost it will start rolling out this fall with new programming being added every month there are also a lot more celebrity and tv people involved than the one that were on stage at the event we cant wait to see if all this very expensive looking programming will be better than apple first attempt at original content carpool karaoke and planet of the apps it honestly not a very high bar to clear,0,0,0,Everything Apple Announced Today

143,this one is for the hardcore novel writer who are doubting themselves the one who committed earlier this month to writing   word in  day but then uh something happened good morning national novel writing month participant did you do your  word this morning read more read a a person who ha completed this challenge ten year in a row including my  novel on thanksgiving day i have some important information it is totally normal even among national novel writing month winner finisher to spend some part of the month in a word deficit that feel like a black hole you ll never climb out of but there s hope i d venture that if you have   word or le left to go you can bust them out today if you re down to   that s gravy your individual writing speed may vary but if you can get the condition just right word will pour out of you here are some thing to try pretend you re in hawaii if you re toiling away tonight and the clock flip to midnight that s it the month is over but since the world is round it really is i promise it s always midnight somewhere that s why i advise you to change your time zone on the nanowrimo website so that you can still log a win late tonight when it s midnight on the east coast it s only pm in hawaii you buy yourself an extra five hour with this trick which i am convinced is not cheating it s just virtual travel if you already live in hawaii i m afraid you are too close to the international date line to buy much time the best you can do is pretend you re in pago pago samoa and that ll buy you an extra hour get suddenly sick i m not saying you should lie to your bos or to the friend who are expecting you at some party or funeral or whatever but if you were to get sick your bos or friend would totally understand that you have to stay home plan an evening of word sprint okay now you have time to write but you need some reason to stay at your desk some engine pushing you on to actually finish this thousand word and the next thousand word i use two thing to superpower my noveling the nanowordsprints twitter account which is staffed   by encouraging writer who announce word sprint writing a much a you can in  minute for example because twitter is social this also give you a place to celebrate and or complain a you complete each spring write or die a writing tool that doe bad thing if you stop typing set it to kamikaze mode and it will erase what you ve written a soon a your finger are idle for a few second it s like the bus in speed but for writing freewrite look you re supposed to write   word that are part of this work of fiction but nobody say it ha to be polished prose especially if you re stuck on a plot point or a bit of world building just freewrite that s a technical writerly term for writing down whatever you re thinking if you think about your novel it look something like this okay i don t know what to do from here but matilda ha to get onto the train somehow even though she s lost her ticket maybe she sneak on maybe she find a squirrel that ha been stealing ticket and hiding them in a hole with acorn underneath the platform maybe that weird guy from chapter  come back and offer to buy her a ticket and she s like ew but i don t want to sit next to you and so then i can spend the whole chapter trying to get her away from him once she s on the train yeah that sound good i m hungry i wonder if there are any cooky downstairs that wa over  word and it took mere second to write i don t even know who matilda is you can fill thousand this way especially if you re trying to feel out your character s backstory or some aspect of the fantasy world your character live in when you get to a plot point you d like to write feel free to switch back to real writing mode find a predictable story arc one thing that make writing hard is not knowing what you re going to write next so find something you do know how to write maybe you can send a character to the doctor that mean they have to make an appointment drive over find parking sign in have an awkward conversation in the waiting room and so on you can spice it up however you want they discover the doctor is really the villain they were trying to track down in the previous chapter whatever make sure to have them run errand afterward and pick up their prescription do something unpredictable or maybe your problem is that your plot is already planned out and you are just too bored to write the next thing so mix it up for the next scene you have planned out ask yourself what is the least predictable thing that could happen here maybe your character wa going to get in a bar fight with the tough guy that s making trouble but the tough guy ha to leave early for his job in the morning and your character decides to follow him to see where he work or maybe a they re squaring up to fight there s an earthquake that demolishes the bar even cheaper trick look you do what you have to give your character lengthier name search and replace for example ann can become anna elizabeth who think she is a princess for literally every mention of her name if you just spent an hour on facebook instead of writing gather up all your comment and status and put them in your novel it s your character that s wasting time on facebook not you anna elizabeth who think she is a princess would like to spend a whole chapter telling the reader her political opinion have a two headed character or fine two separate character who get into argument about everything write a lot of appendix have your character on a spaceship write the ship s technical manual murder mystery make an appendix that s a timeline of how thing actually happened and in what order western list the name of all the horse in the town and what color they are do you know how to knit have one character teach another how to knit don t spare any detail don t delete anything ever have a scene that doesn t quite work well you wrote it so it count select it and hit format gt text gt strikethrough or whatever doe that job in the software you re using and keep counting those word your character s favorite recipe and song lyric deserve space in the book don t you think you can do this i believe in you,0,0,0,"Dirty Tricks to Finish NaNoWriMo Today, Even If You’re Behind"
