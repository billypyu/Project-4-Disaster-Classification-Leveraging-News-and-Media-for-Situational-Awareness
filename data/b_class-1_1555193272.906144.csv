Mike Epstein,"Its time for everybodys favorite legal news, folksclass-action settlement time! If you purchased a new non-ThinkPad Lenovo laptop between September 1, 2014 and February 28, 2015, theres a good chance you are eligible to claim at least $40 as a make-good for the company installing adware on its computers, hampering their performance in order to steal your personal information.
This possibly-unexpected boon is the result of a lawsuit filed by consumers against Lenovo and software developer Superfish Software in 2014, alleging that an app that came installed on new Lenovo laptops called VisualDiscovery accessed private information without permission, including social security numbers, financial records, and healthcare information. The app also reportedly impacted laptops technical performance. According to Bloomberg, the companies agreed to an $8.3 million settlement last November.
While the lawsuit specifies a time range when claimants would have purchased applicable devices, the suit technically applies to a specific set of laptops that came with the software. Heres a full list of all the models that qualify for a settlement.
G-Series: G410, G510, G710, G40-70, G50-70, G40-30, G50-30, G50-45
U-Series: U430P, U430Touch, U530Touch
Y-Series: Y40-70, Y50-70
Z-Series: Z50-75, Z40-70, Z50-70
Flex Series: Flex2 14D, Flex2 15D, Flex2 14, Flex2 15, Flex2 15(BTM), Flex 10
Miix Series: Miix2-10, Miix2-11
Yoga Series: Yoga2Pro-13, Yoga2-13, Yoga2-11BTM, Yoga2-11HSW
To see if your computer fits the bill, you can check the sticker with the model number and bar code on the bottom of the laptop, or check the model information by going to the System Information application in Windows 8 or 10.
Once you know youre eligible, its time to make a claim. You have until March 25, 2019 to file one of two types of claims. A short-term claim, which will get you the aforementioned $40, just requires you to say that you owned one of the affected laptops. A long-term claim can earn you much moreup to $750 according to the claim formbut requires documentation that shows how the software directly caused you to lose money, such as identity theft caused by a security issue. You can only make one claimshort- or long-termper device, so make sure youre positive about what you want to do.
Either way, you can file your claim through this online form. If you received an email about the settlement, you can use the Notice ID and confirmation code found on that message, which Im sure speeds up the process. If you never received an email or deleted it, thats ok too, you just need to fill out the online form.
Though the forms are due in March, its tough to say when exactly claimants will get their settlement money. As Doctor of Credit points out, there will be a hearing to confirm the settlement on April 18, 2019. There may also be appeals on the decision, whether or not it is approved. So dont expect to get that settlement money in your pocket ASAP, but rather, set your self up for a nice surprise to compensate for what was, I imagine, an awful shock when you first heard about what was happening with your laptop and personal information.","It’s time for everybody’s favorite legal news, folks—class-action settlement time!

DAVID LEONHARDT,"If you, dear reader, happen to be in this group, Im not trying to dismiss your economic anxieties. I know that you may not feel rich. You probably have big mortgage payments, rising medical costs and perhaps eye-popping tuition bills.
But Id ask you to spend a minute thinking about how much more challenging life is for the bottom 90 percent. These households aren't making six-figure incomes, and they have received only meager raises over the past few decades. They aren't receiving their fair share of the country's economic growth. No wonder so many feel frustrated.
And for too long, the countrys economic policy, even under Democrats, has blurred the distinction between the upper middle class and the actual middle class.
In the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both used $250,000 as the upper limit of the middle class. (Even in the New York area, $250,000 in pre-tax income puts a household in the top 10 percent.) Obama then delivered a tax cut for everyone below that cutoff. In the 2016 campaign, Clinton and Sanders used the same definition.
A better approach exists. Politicians should recognize that there are three broad income groups, not just two. The bottom 90 percent of Americans does deserve a tax cut, to lift its stagnant incomes. The top 1 percent deserves a substantial tax increase. The upper middle class deserves neither. Its taxes should remain roughly constant, just as its share of economic output has.
So heres some good news: The 2020 Democratic candidates are moving in this direction.
Kamala Harriss big tax cut applies only to families making less than $100,000. Elizabeth Warrens child-care proposal delivers 99 percent of its benefits to the bottom 90 percent of earners, according to Moodys Analytics. The housing plans from Harris and Cory Booker give all their benefits to the bottom 90 percent, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The tax cut from Sherrod Brown, whos a potential candidate, is likewise focused on the middle class and poor.
Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman who co-wrote Browns tax plan, has a useful way of thinking about this. Our priority has to be the working poor and those struggling to make it into the middle class, Khanna told me. What do the upper middle class care most about in my district? They want a pluralistic America that is engaged with the world and embraces technology and future industries. What they dont want is a backlash to diversity, a backlash to globalization, a backlash to technology.",Is it more similar to the top 1 percent or the working class?,2019-02-24T23:59:43Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How the Upper Middle Class Is Really Doing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/opinion/income-inequality-upper-middle-class.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/opinion/24leonhardt/merlin_59134603_ac778c10-6297-429f-963a-4c5bdc91d142-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1
Andrew J. Hawkins,"The G-Wagen may be the showstopper for Mercedes-Benz at the NAIAS, but we’re also interested in the batteries powering new 53-Series AMG E-Class. These 53-series models of the CLS, the E-Class Coupe, and the E-Class Cabriolet are now certified autobahn burners, with a brand new, electrified 3.0-liter engine featuring an exhaust gas turbocharger and an electric auxiliary compressor.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","As you may recall, banking giant Wells Fargo was involved in a fraud scandal in 2016 that led to a class action settlement worth almost $150 million. If you were affected by the fake account-opening scheme, you can claim your cut of the settlement by July 7 (the previous deadline was February 8, but it was extended). According to Business Insider, Wells Fargo is notifying those affected by email. “If you believe Wells Fargo opened a checking, savings, credit card, or line of credit account for you without your permission, or if you purchased identity theft protection from us, you may be entitled to compensation from this fund,” reads a statement emailed to customers on April 20. “If you submit a claim, you may be eligible for reimbursement of fees, compensation for potential impact on your credit, and an additional cash payment based on any money remaining in the fund after benefits and costs are paid out.” You can mail in your claim or file one online here (and you can read more at this site ). If you need assistance, you can call 1-866-431-8549 to speak to someone in person. BI also reports that even if you have received compensation from the bank already, you can still file as part of the class action. Wells Fargo has already paid out millions to people who had unauthorized accounts opened in their names, and owes federal regulators $1 billion over separate indiscretions. If you don’t know whether you were affected, check your credit report for unauthorized accounts.","As you may recall, banking giant Wells Fargo was involved in a fraud scandal in 2016 that led to a class action settlement worth almost $150 million.

Jacob Kleinman,"If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way. A new class action lawsuit against the tech giant argues that it knew there was an issue with the device’s microphone and sold it as a premium smartphone anyway. After hearing this news, you may be wondering how to get involved in the lawsuit. Here’s what you need to know about the case, and what you should be doing right now if you bought a Pixel from Google. What’s the Case About? Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones suffer from what the company called a “hairline crack in the solder connection on the audio codec.” In some cases, this made it extremely difficult to use the microphone, making phone calls and voice commands impossible. The company says only 1% of Pixel phones included the defect, but the lawsuit notes that within just a few weeks of the device’s launch people were already reporting issues with the microphone. Instead of offering refunds, Google replaced some defective smartphones with new units that had the exact same issue. Even worse, the company never stopped selling the Pixel and Pixel XL despite mounting evidence that something was wrong. Can I Join the Lawsuit? If this all sounds familiar you probably qualify for the class action lawsuit, and even if you didn’t have any issue with your particular smartphone you should still qualify. According to the filing, the case covers “all individuals in the United States who purchased a Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone, other than for resale, between October 4, 2016 and the present.” The only exceptions are people directly connected to Google or the trial. That includes anyone working at Google, a Google subsidiary, or Google-affiliated company. It also rules out any judges assigned to the case, along with their immediate family. How to Get Involved For now, there’s not much you need to do. Just by buying a Pixel phone you’re included in the class action lawsuit. Once a trial is approved you’ll probably receive a notice in the mail telling you how to actively join the case. It will also explain how to file a claim once the lawsuit is settled— assuming there’s some money to be had. In the meantime, if you really want to get involved you can contact the law firm behind the case on their website. And if you’re feeling left out, the same firm is also looking for people who purchase the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL for a separate investigation into the screen burn-in issue that plagued both of those phones when they launched last fall. You can sign up for that case here.",If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way.

Frederic Lardinois,"Earth Class Mail, a company that digitizes your physical mail so you don’t have to go to the mailbox every day, today announced that it has acquired receipt scanning and expense tracking service Shoeboxed. The reason Earth Class Mail would be interested in Shoeboxed is pretty obvious, given that both companies focus on taking the pain out of dealing with paper. Both services will continue to operate as usual, though we’ll likely see some deep integrations between the two over time. Shoeboxed, which launched eleven years ago, currently digitizes over five million documents per year for its over 1 million customers in 90 countries. Its main market is small businesses in the U.S., though, which make up 500,000 of its users. “When we started in 2008 and put the first iPhone app in the app store to scan receipts; there was one other powerhouse around helping small business go digital — Earth Class Mail,” the company’s CEO and co-founder Tobias Walter tells us. “The combined power of our two companies will be a massive shift for small businesses to finally become paperless and say goodbye to old workflows that cost them hours of their productivity. I could not be happier with the new home we found for the company, the team, and our customers!” What sets Earth Class Mail apart from the United States Postal Service’s Informed Delivery service is that it not only scans the outside of the envelopes that you are about to receive but that you can also give the company permission to scan all the documents inside, too (and the price you pay for the service depends mostly on how many of these full scans you want per month). While Oregon-based Earth Class Mail had to file for bankruptcy protection in 2015, its new leadership team turned the company around. The company says that its annual run rate is now $10 million, up 20 since Jess Garza become its new CEO last December. Walter also notes that users would occasionally send unopened envelopes, too, but the company wasn’t allowed to open them. These customers can now easily become Earth Class Mail users. Over the course of its existence, Shoeboxed only raised a moderate amount of funding, with a $580,000 Series A round led by Novak Biddle Venture Partners in 2008 (when Series A rounds were still much smaller than today) and a $1.4 million Series B round in 2011. The financial details of today’s acquisition were not disclosed.","Earth Class Mail, a company that digitizes your physical mail so you don’t have to go to the mailbox every day, today announced that it has acquired receipt scanning and expense tracking service Shoeboxed.

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties. Because each attendee would often bring a case of whatever cheap lager they favored, I would often find my many bottles and cans of beer I didn’t really want to drink strewn across my apartment the next morning. (I mean, I drank it, but I wish I would have made some beer pickles too.) It’s Freshman Orientation Week at Lifehacker! This week, we’re covering ways to snap out of your summer haze and into an autumnal blitz of activity, whether you’re actually heading to campus for the first time, getting your own kids ready for school, or looking for ways to just be more productive in the classroom of life. So velcro up your Trapper Keepers, students. Class is now in session. You’re most likely already aware that beer makes a great deglazing liquid, but you may not be familiar with its pickling prowess. Using it to season and preserve vegetables is a great way to use up any beer you may not feel like drinking. (Just kidding. I know you guys always feel like drinking all the beer, but these pickles really are good.) The brine is simple enough—it’s beer, vinegar, salt and sugar, plus whatever other flavorful friends you want to add. I’ve used this brine to pickle both onions and corn, and both were delightfully sweet and sour and infused with just a touch of debauchery. To make it yourself, you will need: Your produce of choice—This amount of brine will cover one small onion, one large cucumber, or two ear’s worth of corn kernels. 3/4 cup white vinegar 1/2 cup beer (Pick your poison! I used an IPA this time but lagers and stouts are also tasty.) 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon salt 2 cloves of smashed garlic 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 1 bay leaf Cut your onions into slivers, slice your cucumbers, or remove your corn kernels from the cob. Place the prepared produce in a pint-sized mason jar or a soup container, and set it aside. If you want your pickles to have a kick, halve a jalapeño and throw that in there too. Add the remaining ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, pour the hot brine over the vegetables, cover them loosely, and let the liquid cool to room temperature. Pop your pickles in the fridge to cool overnight, then put them on sandwiches, sausages, and leftover pizza (for a very collegiate experience).","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties.

Back in the day when Sony launched the product, it tried to sell the gaming console as a “computer” as well, going as far as to say that you could install and run Linux on it. While technically a possibility, turns out it was also a security issue, so Sony ditched the feature through a firmware update. A few PlayStation buyers filed a class action lawsuit against the company, and it recently agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle the suit. The five main plaintiffs are each getting $3,500, and the remaining cash is being split amongst other PlayStation buyers, lawyers, and settlement organizers. What that means for you If you purchased the original PlayStation 3 (the “fat one) between November 1, 2006 and April 1, 2010 then you’re potentially entitled to some cash, CNET notes. You need to have made the purchase from an authorized PlayStation retailer in the United States to qualify, which means Craiglist and dorm room deals don’t qualify. You also have to claim you used the Other OS functionality and think your console lost value when Sony took that functionality away, and be willing to attest, under penalty of perjury those facts. To get your cash you’ll have to fill out this claim form and provide the serial number of your PS3 or your PlayStation Network Sign-In info that you use with the device or PlayStation Network Online ID.

Jessica Conditt,"This isn't Facebook's first brush with large-scale privacy concerns, but the political implications have made the scandal mainstream news. Shareholders and Facebook users have filed lawsuits against the company; Mozilla, Tesla and other major organizations have pulled their ads and pages from the site; Congress wants Zuckerberg to testify; and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company's privacy practices. However, Zuckerberg doesn't appear to be worried about his position at Facebook. He's completed the expected apology tour, publishing a Facebook post about the issue, participating in interviews where he reiterated his written sentiments, and finally appearing on CNN to say the same things yet again, but this time, on-camera. He's appeared appropriately calm, concerned and confident, and not once has he had to answer questions about his own job security. There may be a hashtag to #DeleteFacebook, but there are no rallying cries to #FireZuckerberg or otherwise see him step down. This is because Zuckerberg is uniquely insulated at the top of the company, with no one truly able to force his hand in any direction. The same reason he should be held responsible for Facebook's gross mismanagement of user data is also the reason he isn't sweating over his role -- Zuckerberg is the king of Facebook. It's nearly impossible to exile him. Facebook is a public company, which means it has a board of directors representing the stockholders. Traditionally, when a CEO is forced out of their public company, it's because the board voted to get rid of them -- each member owns a different percentage of shares and thus a different percentage of the vote, giving some folks more power than others. But, if a majority vote the same way, the motion passes. As chairman of the board, Zuckerberg controls 87 percent of Facebook voting shares. Even if the remaining eight board members wanted to kick him out, they don't have the power to do so, unless Zuckerberg decides to play along and vote himself out. This consolidation of power didn't happen by accident. In December 2015, Zuckerberg pledged to give away 99 percent of his Facebook shares -- valued at $45 billion at the time -- to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charitable organization he founded with his wife. In order to do this without reducing Zuckerberg's majority on the board, Facebook took a page of out the Google founders' handbook. It introduced a new type of non-voting stock, Class C, that split every share for every stockholder into three distinct shares. A share worth $100 was transformed into three $33 shares, two of which were Class C, meaning they didn't carry any voting rights. Zuckerberg controls 87 percent of Facebook voting shares. This allows Zuckerberg to divest 99 percent of his shares without giving up control of the board. When Google did this same thing in 2014 to protect the status of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, shareholders weren't too pleased with the plan -- just 12.7 percent voted to pass it. Page and Brin used their majority to push it through regardless. Facebook drew ire for its Class C plan, too. In February 2017, a proposal to oust Zuckerberg as chairman gained traction among shareholders, with the Class C changes cited as proof of his unchecked power. However, a few upset shareholders can't get rid of Zuckerberg -- and besides, the board doesn't seem to want that. Aside from Zuckerberg, the Facebook board includes eight people, all of whom have high-profile histories in tech entrepreneurship: Peter Thiel, Jan Koum, Reed Hastings, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Kenneth Chenault, Erskine Bowles, Marc Andreessen and Sheryl Sandberg. These folks are generally happy with the way Zuckerberg runs Facebook as a business. Even after the Cambridge Analytica scandal wiped out about $100 billion from Facebook's market capitalization, the company is still worth about $440 billion. Facebook earned a record $12.97 billion in profit just in the final quarter of 2017, despite the fact that people are spending less time on the site. Zuckerberg has proven himself to be a capable leader in times of crisis, navigating the site through fake news debacles, questions over its political influence and previous privacy concerns. Zuckerberg is doing the same thing with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and board members have no reason, for now, to stop him. Disrupting the Facebook hierarchy would only throw the company into further turmoil. Besides, they're all still making money. Whether at a public or private company, profit is the defining factor when it comes to kicking out a CEO. Uber was bleeding cash at the time of Kalanick's firing, and Yahoo was in such dire straits under Mayer that Verizon requested a $1 billion reduction in its acquisition price. For now, Facebook is still making bank for its board members, meaning Zuckerberg is secure. At Facebook, nothing happens without Zuckerberg's approval. As chairman, CEO and founder of Facebook, Zuckerberg enjoys vast control over the entire company. Even outside of Facebook, in the real world, he's a prominent figure who's been canonized on the silver screen as a hesitant kid genius, idolized by hoodie-wearing computer science majors across Silicon Valley and beyond. Zuckerberg's success has been wrapped up with Americana fantasy, presented as proof that talent and a good idea are enough to make somebody's -- anybody's -- life. But that's all armchair psychology. Perhaps there's no outcry for Zuckerberg's removal because things simply aren't bad enough yet. Maybe if the official number of mined Facebook accounts hits 1 billion, or if more evidence of mishandled data comes to light, public pressure will grow to a fervor that forces him to step aside, for the good of the company's bottom line. For now, though, Zuckerberg is protected by a clean reputation, the dazzle of Hollywood and the company hierarchy that he personally built. At Facebook, nothing happens without Zuckerberg's approval: This includes letting a company like Cambridge Analytica mine Facebook users' data without their permission or firing the CEO. Especially when that CEO is Zuckerberg himself.","We've seen it countless times.

Started franchising: 1955   Total units: 37,406   Cost to open: $1.06M–$2.23M
If you haven’t walked into a McDonald’s in the past year or two, prepare to be disoriented.
You’ll be greeted with smooth wood and glass surfaces, along with digital menu boards that run promotional footage to stimulate your appetite. You can order at one of the touchscreen kiosks that allow you to explore the menu at your leisure and customize your order without worrying about holding up the line and pissing off the cashier. You can pick up your food at the counter, request table service, or, if you’re rushed, skip the whole process: McDonald’s new mobile app allows you to order from your phone and have a store clerk run out food to your car in the parking lot. Actually, McDonald’s will bring you food anywhere. Through a partnership with Uber Eats, the order-however-the-hell-you-want-to company now offers home delivery from roughly 9,000 U.S. stores.
This is part of what the company calls its Experience of the Future overhaul, a massive rethink that’s already rolled out to 7,000 of its 14,000 U.S. units and will ultimately transform every McDonald’s in America. But the new look isn’t just physical. The iconic Quarter Pounder -- formerly a frozen, puck-like patty that clanked when it landed on a hot metal grill -- is now made from never-frozen meat. The chicken in its sandwiches is from birds raised without human-grade antibiotics. The frappés contain milk lacking bovine growth hormones.

The changes are having big results, leading to McDonald’s nabbing the top spot on the Entrepreneur Franchise 500® once again. The 64-year-old company has landed atop our list more than any other franchise except Subway -- but today, that sandwich rival has slipped to #125. So what keeps McDonald’s ahead? The answer is clear: constant reinvention. It’s been the Golden Arches’ secret all along.
The latest round of re-creation began in 2015. That’s when Steve Easterbrook rose from chief brand officer to CEO and inherited a company that had declines in same-store sales for nearly two years. He wasted no time in shaking things up. Shortly after taking the helm, he said in a video that “the reality is our recent performance has been poor. We can no longer afford to support legacy structures, legacy commitments, or legacy attitudes.” 
Easterbrook immediately began stripping away layers from the company’s international structure, and, at the same time, he launched menu initiatives that better align McDonald’s with modern food preferences. During his first week as CEO, he announced the company’s two-year plan to move away from chicken with antibiotics and milk with hormones, and also began testing all-day breakfast (which would roll out nationwide a few months later). “That was the number one request from customers for decades,” says Sara Senatore, a Bernstein senior restaurant market analyst. “The pushback all along has been due to operational challenges, but Easterbrook said, ‘If the customers want it, it’s going to happen.’ ”
Easterbrook also began strengthening the company’s franchise network, selling thousands of corporate-owned stores to independent owners. “You’ve seen chains like Burger King, Wendy’s, and Buffalo Wild Wings do this, too,” says Mark Siebert, franchise consultant and CEO of the iFranchise Group. “From a capital structure standpoint, franchisors can improve their sheet by taking money that’s tied up in illiquid assets and redeploying it more effectively.” At the start of 2015, McDonald’s was 81 percent franchised. Now franchisees make up 95 percent of U.S. locations and more than90 percent worldwide. 
The strategy is paying off: The company is riding on 13 consecutive quarters of positive growth. “This is helping us deepen our customer relationships and enhance our perception as a more modern, progressive McDonald’s,” says Lucy Brady, senior vice president of corporate strategy and business development. “We’re expanding choices, building awareness of the breadth of our menu and quality of our food, enhancing convenience, and elevating the overall experience.” 
It’s easy to view this as a new era for the Golden Arches, and in some ways it is. But there’s another way of looking at it. This is just the latest phase of McDonald’s constant evolution, one that began not long after it was founded. McDonald’s owes its long-standing reign not just to being faster and cheaper than the competition, but to being more nimble. Even when the company stumbles over its own clown-size shoes -- and it certainly has -- it recovers before lasting damage is done.

Of course, change is hard -- and that’s especially true when your brand consists of thousands of locations that pull in annual revenues north of $8 billion in the U.S. alone. But by rerouting the ship, McDonald’s is doing more than avoiding a crash. It’s proving once again the incredible resiliency of the franchise model.
The oldest operating McDonald's is this L.A.operation, opened in 1953.

The story of the Golden Arches is one of postwar American capitalism. As it goes, a salesman named Ray Kroc was hawking five-spindle milkshake machines in 1954 when he heard that two brothers in San Bernardino, Calif. -- Dick and Maurice McDonald -- were using eight of his machines at one location. That meant they could produce 40 milkshakes at a time. Why did they need to make so many? Kroc visited the brothers to find out.
In his autobiography, Grinding It Out, Kroc recounts pulling up to McDonald’s and waiting in his car for the restaurant to open. Before customers arrived, men in white paper hats began hauling in boxes of hamburger and sacks of potatoes. “They were bustling around like ants at a picnic,” he wrote. And they appeared to be making too much food for such a small building.
But Dick and Maurice did a staggering business. Their restaurant had no waitstaff, so customers lined up at a window off the kitchen to order 15-cent burgers. They could add cheese for 4 cents, or tack on fries, a milkshake, or a soda, and the order would appear almost immediately. 
“I don’t remember whether I ate a hamburger for lunch that day or not,” wrote Kroc, in what amounts to an odd confession for a man falling in love with a restaurant. But initially, it wasn’t the food that set Kroc’s heart aflutter. It was the efficiency -- not to mention the potential to sell milkshake machines.
The next day, Kroc attempted to convince Dick and Maurice to open more restaurants. “It’ll be a lot of trouble,” said Dick. So Kroc suggested a solution: He’d handle the national franchising efforts, and they could call the shots. For each franchise sold, Kroc would take 1.4 percent of gross sales, and the McDonald brothers would receive .5 percent.

The deal came together quickly, but the relationship that followed was famously combative. In 1961, after opening hundreds of stores that collectively brought in nearly $130 million in sales, Kroc bought the brothers out of the business. Four years later, the company went public at $22.50 per share, and by the end of the first month, it was trading at $50. 
McDonald’s owes its growth in part to Kroc’s faith in franchising. He was a strong leader, yet he refused to let power calcify at the top of the organization. “It has always been my belief that authority should be placed at the lowest possible level,” he wrote in Grinding It Out. “I wanted the man closest to the stores to be able to make decisions without directives from headquarters.”
That allowed franchisees to respond to customer demands and test out new ideas, some of which turned into hits. The Filet-O-Fish was created by a franchisee in a Roman Catholic part of Cincinnati, where the local crowd didn’t eat meat on Fridays. The Big Mac came from a Pittsburgh franchisee who was losing sales to a chain with bigger cheeseburgers. And the Egg McMuffin was born in the kitchen of a California franchisee who just really, really liked breakfast. “Most of the things being sold in McDonald’s today were first trialed in local places,” says food historian Andrew Smith, author of Food in America. “If people bought them, McDonald’s put them on the national menu.” And if not? See the low-fat McLean Deluxe or the Hula Burger, a failed cheeseburger that replaced tomato with grilled pineapple.
Through a combination of new menu items and buzzy limited-time offerings -- like the McRib, the St. Patrick’s Day Shamrock Shake, and the recently returned Szechuan Sauce -- McDonald’s generally managed to keep its customers’ appetites satisfied. But decades later, Kroc’s vision of flexibility was tested when those very customers started associating fast with unhealthy. The restaurant that pioneered fast food was caught on its heels, and it would take years to fully recover. 
At the start of 2000, McDonald’s looked like it might not fit into the 21st century. Dire statistics about obesity, diabetes, and heart disease were fueling national shifts in diet, and growth of fast food slowed while rival fast-casual joints -- which sold the promise of a healthier meal -- started gaining ground. 
It’s not as if growth suddenly stopped. Between 1998 and 2006, McDonald’s added some 1,300 stores to expand its network by about 10 percent, and revenues grew by 53 percent. But during that same period, the much smaller Panera grew 500 percent, and Chipotle exploded nearly 40 times over -- from 13 to more than 500 locations. (McDonald’s was actually Chipotle’s majority shareholder during this time.)
If McDonald’s customers didn’t notice, investors did. In November 1999, McDonald’s stock was above $48 a share. By January 2000, it had dropped below $40. The 2001 book Fast Food Nation blasted the industry, and McDonald’s in particular, for promoting obesity and widening the nation’s income disparity, and the next year, a survey published in the trade publication Restaurants &amp; Institutions ranked McDonald’s a disappointing 15th in terms of food quality among burger chains. 
For fourth quarter 2002, McDonald’s reported a loss for the first time in the company’s history, and in March 2003, the company’s stock hit a low of $12.12 -- down 70 percent from where it ended in 1999. The next year, Morgan Spurlock’s documentary Supersize Me blamed the fast-food chain for making him depressed, lethargic, and 24.5 pounds heavier in one month.
McDonald’s has generally taken its critics seriously. After Supersize Me, the company removed the supersize option from its menu. A short time later, it began offering nutrition information for every item, and it removed trans fats from the frying oil. The changes helped shore up investor confidence -- by 2007, McDonald’s stock was recovering -- but years of playing the nutritional villain resulted in lagging sales. For first quarter 2015, just as Easterbrook was taking over as CEO, the company reported that same-store sales in the U.S. were down 2.3 percent. By the third quarter, after his changes started to reach stores, the company was growing revenues again, with comparable sales up .9 percent. And it has had steady quarterly growth since.
The campaign to improve the product is ongoing, and recently, McDonald’s announced that its seven classic burgers are now being made without artificial colors or flavors. The yogurt in its Happy Meals, just like the chicken in its McNuggets, is preservative-free, and to keep the Happy Meal calories below 600, the chain has downsized the fries and eliminated cheeseburgers as an option.

McDonald’s hasn’t gone so far as to add steamed broccoli as a side dish. But the changes do reflect an effort to recalibrate speed in a slow-food era, where expediency is often conflated with obesity. Early last year, the company announced that Quarter Pounders and Smokehouse Burgers would be made with never-frozen, made-to-order beef, and it’s testing made-to-order chicken at 160 locations in Washington. It’s also ramped up the limited-time promotions, with offerings like a $6 Classic Meal Deal and -- as part of a balancing act that signals open doors to even hedonistic diners -- Triple Breakfast Stacks, sandwiches served with extra cheese and sausage. (All McDonald’s eggs will be cage-free by 2020, says the company.)
Taken together, the changes could make McDonald’s seem like a wholly different restaurant than the one that existed 20 years ago. That’s the point. “Change has been our history,” Kroc wrote in 1977, using language that’s still fresh today.

McDonald’s expects that every one of its restaurants will have undergone Experience of the Future renovations by 2020, at a total cost of $6 billion. It’s a huge bet on staying current while keeping what has made the company great. 
“Experience of the Future is about creating that sort of digital relevance and convenience that people are beginning to expect,” says David Palmer, a food and restaurant analyst at RBC Capital. “It sends cues, from a brand perspective, that ‘we’re open for business in whatever way you want to do business with us.’ ”
On a recent earnings call, Easterbrook identified the initiative as “the largest construction project in our history,” one in which franchisees are fronting about 45 percent of the cost. The corporate entity is coming up with the rest. 
Of course, the plan isn’t without friction. When an individual store undergoes construction, the kitchen shuts down, construction equipment clogs up the parking lot, and customer routines are disrupted. Stores are generally completely closed for five to 10 days, according to a company spokesperson. And they could be partially shut down for slightly longer -- with, say, only a drive-through open. 
“Restaurants have experienced a little longer downtime than we expected,” says the senior VP Brady. “When they do reopen, and it’s a full modernization here in the U.S., we’re getting mid-single-digit-sales uplifts and strong increases in customer satisfaction.”  
Not everyone sees it that way. In October, some 400 franchisees gathered in Tampa, Fla., to air grievances and discuss the possibility of forming a franchisee association. But few analysts see the meeting as a serious threat, says Palmer. In all likelihood, he says, it’s just an effort to renegotiate power after the dustup caused by Easterbrook’s massive organizational changes: “It’s a shot across the bow, obviously. But management at McDonald’s is very smart. They heard.”

Meeting organizers didn’t reply to Entrepreneur inquiries, and McDonald’s declined to comment directly, pointing us to a statement issued at the time of the franchise meeting, which read, in part, “We always welcome and are committed to a constructive, collaborative dialogue with our franchisees.”
In the meantime, things are looking good for McDonald’s. Early last year, it relocated its headquarters from the suburbs of Illinois to Chicago’s West Loop district. And in the third quarter of 2018, it grew while its rivals slowed down: McDonald’s same-store-sales growth was 2.4 percent, while Wendy’s was 1.2 percent and Burger King’s was negative. With the aggressive rate at which the company is rolling out the modern new store format, analysts are optimistic that growth will continue. 
“McDonald’s is becoming a stronger beast,” says Palmer. It’s outperforming the industry now, and he believes that the fast-food titan’s continued upgrades will put it even further ahead of competitors. How long will that last? McDonald’s knows one thing for sure: Change is inevitable, so it can’t stop now.

AJ Dellinger,"A class action lawsuit filed Friday alleges that Samsung, Hynix, and Micron—three of the largest DRAM manufacturers in the world—colluded to limit supplies of the memory type and drive up the prices of their products, according to 9to5Mac. The suit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California by the Hagens Berman law firm, claims that the scheme resulted in “illegally inflated prices” for devices that employ DRAM. The suit seeks to secure a settlement for anyone in the United States who purchased a device using DRAM between July 1, 2016 and February 1, 2018. The primary evidence cited in the case is an independent investigation conducted by Hagens Berman, which claims to have discovered an agreement between the tech manufacturers designed to raise the price of DRAM, an increasingly common memory type found in millions of devices. Throw a stone in your local electronics store (don’t, you’ll break something and they will make you pay for it) and you’ll hit a device that uses DRAM. It’s used in Android smartphones, Windows laptops, MacBooks, iPhones, gaming consoles, you name it. According to the law firm, there was a 47 percent spike in the price of DRAM in 2017—the largest such increase in nearly 30 years. Prior to last year, the price of DRAM actually dropped year after year, by about three percent between 2012 and 2017 and by an average annual rate of 33 percent between 1978 and 2012, according to IC Insights. The vast majority of the DRAM market is controlled by Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The three companies combined to ate up 96 percent of the market share for the memory type in 2017. The demand for DRAM skyrocketed by 77 percent last year, after having dropped by eight percent in 2016. That at least in part plays into the suggestion that the three companies colluded to create a limited supply in the market in order to increase demand and crank up their prices. “What we’ve uncovered in the DRAM market is a classic antitrust, price-fixing scheme in which a small number of kingpin corporations hold the lion’s share of the market,” Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman, said in a statement. “Instead of playing by the rules, Samsung, Micron and Hynix chose to put consumers in a chokehold, wringing the market for more profit.” The law firm of Hagens Berman is no stranger to taking on DRAM manufacturers. The attorneys pursued a similar lawsuit in 2006 and won more than $300 million. Class action suits are the Hagens Berman specialty, and the law firm isn’t afraid to embrace that. The Hagens Berman Twitter handle is @ClassActionLaw, and the law firm claims to have secured more than $260 billion in settlements for consumers. Scrolling through the litigation pursued by the law firm is an exhausting exercise. Just since the start of the new year, Hagens Berman has been behind suits filed against Apple, Facebook, Tesla, six major hotel chains, BMW, and Harvey Weinstein. It’s worth noting that while class action lawsuits can be a valuable way to hold accountable companies that try to cheat consumers, it’s not a great way to actually compensate the victims. A 2013 study conducted by the law firm Mayer Brown found the majority of payouts from class action suits don’t go to the class. In two cases studied by the firm, less than one percent of the winnings went to consumers. Most class action suits don’t even go to trial, either getting dismissed or settled before reaching that point. No one is going to shed tears for Samsung, Micron, or Hynix if the companies have to empty some change from their pockets to pay for the alleged price fixing. Just don’t expect to get the cost of your smartphone covered by the case.

Brian Heater,"This morning, Parrot unveiled the Anafi, a new drone clearly targeted at DJI’s Mavic line. According to the French company, the new portable UAV is the product of two years of development and a “wish list of user feedback and a biomimetic design inspired by insects.” Like the Mavic, the 0.7-pound drone is foldable, for maximum portability, so photographers can stash it away along with the rest of their equipment for travel — or just keep it in a jacket pocket. There’s a 4K HDR camera on-board, and a 21-megapixel still unit mounted on a gimbal. Parrot estimates battery life at 25 minutes — which is pretty solid, as far as this class of drone is concerned. It also can be swapped out with additional batteries, which run $99 a pop. The company also claims the drone is the quietest in its class. It’s not silent, of course, but that buzzing lawn mower sound has been reduced by about a third compared to earlier models from the company. The drone has a controller that plugs into an iPhone or Android device, for touchscreen visualizations via the FreeFlight 6 app. And like the Mavic line, it features a number of different control modes focused on capturing different camera content, including an option for following a subject and, yes, a selfie mode. The price certainly seems right here. At $699, it’s $100 less than the Mavic Air. Though, at first glance, it appears as though it might not be as advanced as DJI’s latest stab at creating a truly mainstream drone. The Anafi is due out July 1 through Parrot, Amazon and “select retailers.”","This morning, Parrot unveiled the Anafi, a new drone clearly targeted at DJI’s Mavic line.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Because flying wasnt quite unpleasant or expensive enough, four major domestic airlines have increased their checked bag fee in 2018, including American, Delta, JetBlue and United. While the exact prices often vary by destination, when you add amenities (for example, some carriers will charge more if you dont reserve your seat or add a bag during the online check-out process), the different tier of flying classes and, in the case of baggage, weight, deciphering all of the fees youre going to pay can be difficult. And it might become even more confusing MarketWatch reports that Congress is considering repealing the the so-called full fare advertising rule, which requires a carrier to quote a ticket price that includes all taxes and fees.

Premium economy and business class ticket holders can check two bags for free; those in first on a three-class aircraft can check three bags with no charge.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Zero exercise is not enough. Going for a walk every day is probably a good thing. And if you’re training for a marathon, you’ll be on your feet for a couple hours of hard workouts every week. But what is the benchmark for a human being just trying to squeeze enough healthy exercise into their life? Let’s break it down. It’s easy to feel motivated about the idea of exercising. Let’s all run marathons! And do a push-up … Read more Read Fortunately, all the major public health organizations are in agreement. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association are all on board with the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise like walking, ideally broken up into 30 minutes per day over five days 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise like running, ideally in three 25-minute chunks It only counts if you do 10 minutes or more in each session, and you should spread your sessions throughout the week (so, you can’t take a single 90-minute spinning class and figure you’re done.) If you’re a stroll-around-the-neighborhood person, go with the first recommendation. If you enjoy hard workouts, but would rather not change into your gym clothes every day, you can just go with the 75 minute recommendation. And feel free to mix and match. Here are some possibilities: Walk 15 minutes to and from work every week day (5 x 30 minutes = 150 moderate) Go running on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, each for 2-3 miles (3 x 25 minutes = 75 vigorous) Take a 90-minute heart-pounding cycling class, and go for a walk after dinner at least a few other days of the week (1 x 90 minutes = 90 vigorous, plus perhaps 3 x 15 = 45 moderate) Go for a 30-minute easy bike ride on Monday. Try a 45-minute water aerobics class on Wednesday. Take a short hike on Saturday. Mow the lawn for an hour on Saturday. (30 + 45 + 30 + 60 = 165 moderate) If you’re confused about what counts in each category, the UK’s National Health Service has a list of “moderate” and “vigorous” activities here. I love long walks and runs, but I tend to not too many of them for one reason: I get bored. Walking … Read more Read If you’re pretty athletic, the above won’t sound like much. Good news! The WHO has set a secondary goal for folks like you. It’s simple: just do double the above. So you can aim for 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity: Two of those killer 90-minute classes, Monday and Thursday A three-mile run every weekday An hour-long martial arts class three times a week...or, to meet the requirement with moderate activity, you can stroll for an hour before breakfast each day, the favorite activity of spunky grandmas and grandpas who will probably never die. (To be fair, the recommendations we’re talking about are for people up to age 65.) So, what about an upper limit? There isn’t one, from a public health point of view. More is better. (And even if you are doing less than the recommendations, anything is better than nothing.) That said, it is possible for you as an individual to do more exercise than your body is ready for. Don’t jump from a life of occasional strolling to a marathon training plan. And if you are on that marathon training plan and you’re feeling worn down, take a break already. Strength, Flexibility, and More So far we’ve been talking about aerobic exercise, which is the kind where you’re continuously moving (or, perhaps, doing quick work/rest intervals) and your heart rate is up. But there are other important forms of exercise, too. The WHO and other organizations recommend two days per week of “high intensity muscle strengthening activity,” which includes anything where you’re thinking in terms of sets and reps. (Three sets of eight to 10 reps is a good structure to start.) So, your workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps for this exercise, 3 sets of 8 after that, and—oh,… Read more Read That activity can be anything that challenges your muscles, and where the 10th rep is a lot harder than the first: lifting weights, or resistance band exercises, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups. So if you run three days per week but have time for more, don’t just fit in extra runs; try adding two days in the weight room instead. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends two other kinds of exercise you might otherwise forget: Two to three days per week that include stretching, ideally spending 60 seconds stretching each major muscle group. This can be in a few short stints of 10-30 seconds each. Two to three days per week that include neuromuscular training. Think of this as hand-eye coordination and its full-body equivalents. Anything involving balance, coordination, or paying attention to your gait fall into these categories. Both of these can fit into your other workouts. Stretching works well in a cool-down session after your main workout, or some people prefer to put it into a warm-up. If you’re doing functional movements like lunges that challenge your balance and coordination, you’re working on neuromuscular fitness.","Zero exercise is not enough.

Megan Rose Dickey,"A U.S. District Court judge has just handed some Uber drivers a win by concluding the ride-hailing company breached a contract pertaining to “Safe Rides” fees. In U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers’ opinion on damages, she wrote “there is no question that drivers were financially harmed by Uber’s breach of contract.” The lead plaintiffs, Matthew Clark, Ryan Cowden, Dominicus Rooijackers and Jason Rosenberg, sued Uber for $5 million in 2016 on behalf of 9,602 drivers who opted out of arbitration. However, the exact extent of the damages has not yet been determined. The plaintiffs alleged Uber, despite saying it wouldn’t, took the “Safe Rides Fees” from the fares drivers charged riders on minimum fare rides between April 2014 and November 2015. The plaintiffs specifically alleged Uber breached its contract with drivers. In her order yesterday, Rogers granted the drivers’ motion for summary judgment, saying, “Nothing in the Agreement provides a formula for Uber to deduct $1.00 from the Minimum Fare and then deduct another 20% from the balance. The fact that Uber chose not to follow the precise terms of the Agreement for the 19 months of the class period and is now attempting to rationalize its conduct is not relevant to the instant claim.” She added, by Uber taking out the $1 Safe Ride fee from the minimum fair before paying drivers, the company “breached the plain terms of the Agreement.” Judge Rogers also ruled all Uber drivers who signed a 2013, June 2014 or November 2014 agreement — or some combination of three — opted out of arbitration, and completed at least one minimum fare ride for UberX when the Safe Rides Fee applied before Nov. 16, 2015 are eligible to be part of the class. Uber first added the $1 safe ride fee in April 2014 to help pay for its safety program, which includes driver training, background checks and vehicle inspections. But it wasn’t until November 16, 2015, the lawsuit alleges, that Uber updated its terms to notify drivers the fee would be taken from their minimum fares. Here’s a key nugget from the original complaint: After instituting the Safe Rides program, Uber’s Service Fee Schedules and published local fare webpages continued to show the fares that riders would pay, including a minimum fare, for each area. Consistent with its contract and its emails to drivers, those schedules and fare webpages also showed the new Safe Rides Fee as a separate surcharge for riders. Until approximately November 2015, nothing in Uber’s contract, schedules, emails, or fare webpages suggested that drivers would pay Uber’s Safe Rides Fee out of the driver’s own fares. Despite the clear terms of its written contracts including Uber’s incorporated emailed promises that it would not do so — Uber took its Safe Rides Fee charges out of the drivers’ fares when drivers charged riders minimum fares. In other words, when a driver provided a minimum fare ride, Uber did not charge the Safe Rides Fees to the riders (as a separate surcharge), but, instead, charged that fee to the drivers by taking it from their fare. This win for drivers comes a couple of years after Uber settled with riders over the Safe Rides fee. In 2016, Uber made a $28.5 million settlement with riders, who alleged in a class-action lawsuit that they should not have had to pay the fee because the company’s background checks were misleading and not “industry leading,” as Uber had previously claimed. The lawsuits also cited “unfortunate incidents” that had happened to passengers during Uber rides. I’ve reached out to Uber and will update this story if I hear back.","A U.S. District Court judge has just handed some Uber drivers a win by concluding the ride-hailing company breached a contract pertaining to “Safe Rides” fees.

Devin Coldewey,"Ever since Eraser, everyone wants a railgun. Turns out China is no exception. Some photos posted by Dafeng Cao, a Twitter user who keeps close tabs on Chinese military developments, show a ship-mounted gun that could very well be the country’s very own homegrown electromagnetically propelled mass driver. Railguns, or coil guns, accelerate solid metal projectiles using ultra-strong electromagnets, firing them well above speeds achieved by conventional ballistic methods. We’re talking Mach 6 here. The U.S. has been working on them for years, and has produced some very cool test videos, but I haven’t heard about any of them being mounted on ships. But Arnold can dual-wield them. It’s all speculation — not like the Chinese military would confirm, although apparently the railgun research is an open secret — but a few things point to the idea that this isn’t just an ordinary deck-mounted gun with a special fairing. First, its relatively short barrel tucked deep in that housing suggests that the acceleration components are all under there, much like the functioning American guns we’ve seen demonstrated. No sense having all that surface area unless it’s protecting something, otherwise you might as well paint a target on it. Hard to imagine conventional naval gun with such a size can be mounted on a 4000 ton class landing ship and didn't affect the stability of the ship. https://t.co/PGqh88iUv3 — dafeng cao (@xinfengcao) February 1, 2018 Second, the ship it’s on isn’t China’s standard test bed ship, the Type 909, despite those vessels being quite new and created for at-sea testing. Dafeng Cao cites a former Chinese Navy officer who says that this is likely because the power output of the 909 not high enough nor flexible enough to sustain the enormous power load necessary to fire these guns. The Type 072, which was used, is more easily retrofitted with… …The third clue, a set of shipping containers mounted just aft of the gun; if it’s anything the railguns we’ve seen, there’s a bunch of power and operational infrastructure that wouldn’t fit inside that fairing, but would fit in a couple containers. The banner said, ""Provide the first-class naval weapon &amp; equipment for building the first-class navy in the world."" That's pretty assertive and ambitious. pic.twitter.com/4L9cuh1tEX — dafeng cao (@xinfengcao) February 2, 2018 Last, a banner has just been raised on the ship that reads, roughly, “Providing first class weapons and equipment for building the best navy in the world.” So it sounds like this is a sort of If China has managed to mount its railgun on a ship, that means they’ve gone to great means to miniaturize and modularize this sophisticated and extremely heavy piece of equipment. Like the U.S. one, it’s almost certainly nowhere near ready for deployment (conventional munitions are far more practical right now), but it may yet be — unlike ours, which has apparently fallen out of favor with naval authorities and will likely never see combat.

Danny Crichton,"Mark Zuckerberg is an autocrat, and not hypothetically. Through his special voting rights held in FB’s Class B shares, he wields absolute command of the company, while owning just a handful of percentage points of the company’s equity. Like any autocrat, he has taken extraordinary measures to maintain control over his realm. He produced a plan exactly two years ago that would have zeroed out the voting rights for everyday shareholders with a new voteless Class C share, only to pull back at the last minute as a Delaware court case was set to begin. He has received the irrevocable proxies of many Facebook insiders, allowing him to control their votes indefinitely. Plus, any Class B shares that are sold are converted to Class A shares, allowing him to continue to consolidate power as people leave. And now, borrowing a page straight out of George Orwell’s 1984, he has even tried to retract and disappear his own messages to others on his platform ( which has now been retracted itself after it became public ). While Congress is right to focus on Cambridge Analytica, and electoral malfeasance, and political ads, and a whole crop of other controversies surrounding Facebook, it should instead direct its attention to the single solution that would begin to solve all of this: dissolve Facebook’s dual-class share structure and thereby democratize its ownership. Just as congressmen are elected under the principle of “one man, one vote,” it should demand that Facebook follow the highest standards used by most other publicly-listed companies and return to “one share, one vote.” Zuckerberg himself should certainly agree with this. After all, the original logic of creating a voteless share class was that the company’s financial performance was strong and Zuckerberg needed to be protected to continue it that way. The plan was announced the same quarter that Facebook crushed its financial results, and there was an absolutely implied connection between those results and the controlling stake held by Zuckerberg. Yet in the two months, from its intraday peak at a share price of $195.32 on February 1, 2018 to today’s price of $160, Facebook has lost more than $100 billion in its market cap. If Congressional inquiries eventually lead to further regulation, it could further erode the value of the stock. It’s easy to argue that a chief executive should be protected when the performance of a company is rocketing up. It’s much harder when everything is crumbling and no one is being held accountable. Shareholders may have been blinded by Facebook’s dizzying growth over the past few years, but we now know that the edifice of that growth is far more tenuous than we ever knew before. Zuckerberg’s 15-year apology tour can no longer sustain the view that corporate governance should be ignored for the good of the share price. There’s just one problem though, and it is the problem that confronts any country with a tyrant: shareholders have no power here to affect change. They can’t change the composition of the board, they can’t change the management team. They can’t change anything at all, since one person controls the realm with an iron fist. A proposal back in 2015 to move to “one share, one vote” was struck down at Facebook’s shareholder meeting. I am not asking for Zuckerberg to be fired, or to resign. I think people should clean up their own messes, and few people have the means to clean up Facebook right now other than him. But I do think there should be consequences, and so far, there have been exactly zero. Zuckerberg has to personally relinquish his control, and no act of mea culpa would better show that he understands the consequences of his actions. There is a counter-argument, which is that ravenous mobs of private investors would swoop into Facebook and force the company to steal even more data from users to sell to advertisers if Zuckerberg lost control. I am wholly unconvinced though, mostly because Facebook has basically done precisely that over its entire history. Plus, any further deterioration of trust with users would strike at the heart of its financial results. Zuckerberg says in his prepared statement that, “My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together.” There are few things he could do to build the community around Facebook’s leadership than sharing the burdens and the responsibilities with a wider, more diverse set of people. Take a page from American history, and abolish the discrimination inherent in the dual-class share vote.","Mark Zuckerberg is an autocrat, and not hypothetically.

Ingrid Lunden,"Ride-sharing startup Lyft, as expected, announced this morning that it is kicking off the roadshow for its IPO — setting the clock ticking for its IPO likely in around two weeks. Around that, it also filled in some more details. The stock will trade as “LYFT” on Nasdaq, and the IPO range is currently set for between $62 and $68 per share to sell 30,770,000 shares of Class A common stock, the company said, raising up to $2.1 billion at the higher end of that range, or $1.9 billion at the lower end. 
At the higher end, its valuation will be $23 billion, as we and others reported yesterday, a large jump on its previous $15.1 billion valuation as of its most recent private fundraising.
Lyft also said in its updated S-1 that at the high end of the range, the maximum offering aggregate price — the maximum that it would raise at that range — will be $2,406,214,000 when considering the full range of Class A stock that will be registered, 35,385,500 shares.
(In addition to the 30,770,000 shares of Class A common stock, the company said it has an additional 4,615,500 shares in options for the underwriters, adding up to the 35 million share figure. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Jefferies LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. are book-running managers for the offering.)
The news kicks off the timer on Lyft’s public listing at a time when all eyes are on how ride-sharing companies will progress to the next stage of their growth, with Uber (valued at around $100 million) also expected to file and go public imminently.
Lyft’s revenues are growing fast — Lyft took $8.1 billion in bookings and made $2.1 billion in revenues in 2018, covering 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers — but the company remains unprofitable. The company posted a net loss of $911.3 million in 2018, a figure that has grown in line with revenues, but notably shrunk proportionately. In 2016, revenues were $343.3 million while net loss was $682 million.
This public listing provides a road map for how Lyft can continue to fund its operations and growth while providing liquidity for investors as it continues working on getting into the black.
Lyft said that upon completion of the IPO, CEO and cofounder Logan Green will have 29.31 percent share of the voting power of the outstanding stock, while John Zimmer, cofounder and president, will have 19.45 percent.

Kate Conger,"A federal judge in California has ruled that a class action lawsuit against Yahoo related to a series of data breaches at the company can move forward. Verizon, which bought Yahoo last year for a reduced price of about $4.5 billion, had asked the judge to dismiss many of the lawsuit’s claims. Yahoo users have claimed that the repeat security incidents at the company, and Yahoo’s delayed disclosure of those incidents, exposed them to identity theft and forced them to spend extra money and time securing their personal information. Last fall, Yahoo tripled its initial estimate of the number of user accounts impacted by the breaches from 1 billion to 3 billion. Yahoo has admitted that hackers stole users’ passwords and accessed Yahoo’s internal codebase, which enabled them to forge cookies used to log in to user accounts without a password and to manipulate Yahoo search results. The plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit claim that they would have chosen another email service if they had been informed sooner of Yahoo’s security woes—a claim that U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh found credible. “Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to show that they would have behaved differently had defendants disclosed the security weaknesses of the Yahoo Mail System,” Koh wrote.

BEN CASSELMAN and JIM TANKERSLEY,"On Friday, Mr. McConnell said he had misspoken in his MSNBC appearance. He said that every income group would see a tax cut on average, not that every individual would do so. “You can’t guarantee that absolutely no one sees a tax increase,” Mr. McConnell said. The Times analysis, using the open-source software TaxBrain, found that roughly one-quarter of families in the middle class would see their taxes increase in 2018, by about $1,000 on average. By 2026, the share seeing an increase would rise slightly, to about one-third, and the average increase would rise to about $1,600. For the majority of middle-class families that receive a tax cut, the average savings would be about $1,300 in 2018 and $1,700 in 2026. Under the Senate bill, four out of five high earners would receive tax cuts in 2018. People across income brackets would see savings from the Senate plan in 2018. But for many in the middle class, the savings would be relatively small. The table below shows the average savings, by income, for those who would receive a tax cut. The Times analysis defines the middle class broadly as those earning between two-thirds and twice the median household income, or about $50,000 to $160,000 per year for a family of three. To focus on families, the analysis excluded individual filers and households headed by people 65 or older and is adjusted for the size of each household. Under the House bill, The Times has found, about half of middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026. The analysis did not seek to calculate how workers might benefit from a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, which both the Senate and House bills would reduce to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent today, or project how the bills might increase economic growth and, with it, Americans’ wages. For taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year, the Senate bill offers a more limited upside and downside than the House bill. The Senate bill is less likely than the House bill to yield tax increases for high-income Americans, in part because it cuts the top marginal personal tax rate, while the House bill creates a so-called “bubble rate” that would actually raise taxes on many high-salaried workers. The Senate measure would also produce a smaller average tax windfall for high earners than the House version, in part by offering less generous benefits for owners of businesses known as pass-throughs, which are not organized as corporations. Under the Senate plan, “Americans are especially likely to face a tax increase if they have a smaller family, have mostly wage income instead of investment income, or claim some of the many deductions that the bill repeals, like those for state and local taxes and unreimbursed employee business expenses,” said Lily Batchelder, a professor and tax specialist at New York University Law School, who worked on economic policy in the Obama administration. “They are increasing taxes on many in the middle class, while concentrating their tax cuts on the wealthy.” The Senate bill appears much better for the very wealthy than it is for the somewhat wealthy. About half of families earning between two and three times the median income — or about $160,000 to $240,000 for a family of three — would pay more in 2018 than under existing law. But among the richest families, those earning more than about $500,000 for a family of three, nearly 90 percent would get a tax cut. The findings come with an important caveat: The Senate bill, as written, appears unable to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a Democratic filibuster, meaning Republicans will need to amend it to comply with the budget reconciliation rules and allow permit passage by a simple majority. Those changes could likely include putting expiration dates on some of the bill’s major provisions, which could make the final version of the bill look less favorable to the middle class, particularly in later years. The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances. The Senate bill differs sharply from the House version in its approach to cutting taxes on businesses. But when it comes to taxes on individuals and families, the bills are more similar than different. Both would double the standard deduction while eliminating a raft of deductions and credits. Both would make the child tax credit more generous. Both would restructure federal income tax brackets to impose lower marginal tax rates at most income levels, although the Senate approach, unlike the House version, doesn’t eliminate two brackets entirely. The Senate bill includes features that would make its plan more favorable to the middle class. It preserves some popular tax deductions and credits that the House bill initially would have eliminated, and it makes the child tax credit somewhat more generous and widely available. On the other hand, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, would eliminate the deduction for property taxes, which could lead to higher federal taxes for homeowners in areas with high property tax rates or expensive housing markets. Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said senators could improve the bill with further changes, such as expanding the earned-income tax credit and extending the benefits of the child tax credit to more low-income taxpayers. “We clearly need to do more to help the lowest-income families,” she said. “At the same time, we can engage in more base broadening for the highest-income households, perhaps by eliminating and not just capping the mortgage-interest deduction.” The Times analysis found that roughly one-fifth of the Senate bill’s cuts in 2018 would go to families and individuals earning $1 million or more, and close to half would go to people earning at least $200,000. Between 10 million and 15 million taxpayers earning less than $100,000 a year would pay more than under existing law. Families earning more than $1 million a year would see their after-tax income rise by about 1.7 percent in 2018 compared with what they would make under current law, nearly triple the gains enjoyed by those earning less than $200,000. Over all, the Senate bill would cut individual income taxes by about $30 billion in 2018, and by $900 billion over the next decade, according to Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. And most people in all income groups would see a tax cut, although the cuts would be modest for most lower earners. Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

But with just a little more than two hours to go before market closing, it’s still not trading, and no one seems to know why. An interview I had scheduled with the CEO earlier this afternoon was canceled at the last minute, with the company’s representative saying that M17 couldn’t comment since its shares were not yet actively trading, and thus the company remains under an SEC-mandated quiet period. M17 has had a rocky non-debut so far. Originally targeting a fundraise of $115 million of American Depository Receipts (shares of foreign companies listed domestically on the NYSE), the company concluded its roadshow raising less than half of its target, for a final investment of $60.1 million. The company priced its ADR shares at $8 each, with each ADR representing 8 shares of the stock’s Class A security. My colleague Jon Russell has covered the company’s rapid growth over the past three years. It was formed from the merger of dating app company Paktor and live streaming business 17 Media. Joseph Phua, who was CEO of Paktor, became CEO of the joint M17 company following the merger. Together, the two halves have raised tens of millions in venture capital. M17 provides live streaming and dating apps throughout “Developed Asia” The company’s main product is a live streaming product where creators can build their fanbases and brands. Fans can purchase virtual gifts to send to their favorite artists, and those points are proving to be extraordinarily lucrative for the company. The company, according to its amended F-1 statement, has seen tremendous revenue growth, netting $37.9 million of revenue in the first three months of this year. The company has also been able to attract more live streaming talent, increasing its contracted artists from 999 at the end of December 2016 to 7,719 at the end of March this year. That’s where the good news ends for the company though. Despite that revenue growth, operating losses are torrential, with the company losing $24.8 million in the first three months of this year. The company in its statement says that it has $31.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, giving it limited runway to continue operations without a strong IPO debut. User growth has been mostly stagnant. Active monthly users has increased from 1.5 million to 1.7 million between March 31 of 2017 and 2018. What the company has succeeded in doing is monetizing those users much better. The percentage of users paying on the platform has more than doubled over the same time period, and the value of those users has increased more than 40% to $355 per user per month. The big challenge for M17 is revenue quality. Live streaming represents 91.4% of the company’s revenues, but those revenues are concentrated on a handful of “whales” who buy a freakishly high number of virtual gifts. The company’s top ten users represent 11.8% of all revenues (that’s $447,220 a user in the first three months this year!), and its top 500 users accounted for almost a majority of total revenues. That concentration on the demand side is just as heavy on the supply side. M17’s top 100 artists accounted for more than a third of the company’s revenue. That concentration has improved over the past few months, according to the company’s filing. But Wall Street investors have learned after Zynga and other whale-based revenue models that the sustainability of these businesses can be tough. Finally, one complication for many investors wary of the increasing use of dual-class stock issues is the governance of the company. Phua, the CEO, will have 56.3% of the voting rights of the company, and M17 will be a controlled company under NYSE rules according to the company’s amended filing. Class B shares vote at a 20:1 ratio with Class A share voting rights. All of this is to say that while the company has had some dizzying growth in its revenue numbers over the past 24 months, that success is moderated by some significant challenges in revenue concentration that will have to be a top priority for M17 going forward. Why the company priced and hasn’t traded though remains a mystery, and we have reached out for more comments.","M17 Entertainment, a Taipei-based live streaming and dating app group, priced its IPO this morning on the NYSE and was expected to open trading today according to their final press release.

Jon Russell,"Asian tech company M17, which operates a live-streaming platform and data app business, has confirmed that it has canceled its proposed U.S. public listing and raised private funding to keep its business alive. The Taiwan-based company dramatically halted its NYSE listing last Friday despite pricing its IPO, and now it has clarified the situation. Well, sort of. In an announcement, the company said it had run into “settlement issues” related the listing which is why it was called off. That’s fairly vague, but a little more color came from founder (and rapper) Jeffrey Huang, who lashed out at investment banks Citigroup and Deutsche Bank in a Facebook post (below), as noted by Bloomberg. A spokesperson representing the company declined to comment further. Rather than going public, M17 will remain private. The IPO was set to raise around $60 million — having been scaled down from an original target of $115 million — but now M17 has taken a $35 million injection from existing backers that include Infinity Venture Partners, Majuven, Convergence and Global Grand Capital. The listing looked rocky from the start when M17 failed to hit that $115 million goal, while the shares were priced at $8, below the forecast range of $10-$12. Investors weren’t taken by the business, it seems, which is primarily live-streaming services for registered artists in markets included Taiwan and Japan. It monetizes by selling virtual gifts to viewers who in turn give them to streaming artists. The company also operates dating services courtesy of M17’s merger deal with Singapore-based Paktor last year, but that accounts for under 10 percent of revenue. TechCrunch Danny Crichton explained the situation last week when the IPO was halted, but M17’s surging revenue — which grew 3.2X year-on-year — was offset by significant losses — a negative $24.8 million in the first three months of this year — and stagnant active user growth. Alarmingly, the company had limited runway with just $31.4 million in cash and cash equivalents left on its books. M17 had developed ways to monetize its user base more efficiently, but with some quirks. For example, its top 10 users represent 12 percent of all revenue on the platform — to the tune of $447,220 per user in the first three months of 2018 — while more broadly its top 500 users were responsible for the majority of total revenue. On the artist side, the top 100 streamers picked up over one-third of total income, too. Finally, there may have been unease at the voting structure. Under a dual-class stock system, CEO Joseph Phua would maintain 56 percent of the voting rights with Class B shares voting at a 20:1 ratio against Class A shares. The fresh cash injection will keep the business running a little longer, M17 will need to quickly figure out a Plan B to remain out of trouble.","Asian tech company M17, which operates a live-streaming platform and data app business, has confirmed that it has canceled its proposed U.S. public listing and raised private funding to keep its business alive.

Kate Clark,"The Google employee walkout on Nov. 1 is leaving a lasting impact on the tech industry. In the immediate aftermath of the walkout, which saw thousands of Googlers across the globe protest the company’s mishandling of sexual harassment and misconduct claims, the search giant said it would put an end to its policy of forced arbitration for employees claiming workplace harassment. Facebook followed suit, announcing the next day that it would allow its employees to pursue claims of sexual harassment in court. Today, Airbnb and eBay confirmed to TechCrunch they too would no longer require sexual harassment claims to be settled through private arbitration. Their announcements emerged as a result of a BuzzFeed News article exploring which tech companies were updating their policies in light of the Google protest. Thousands of Google employees protested the company’s handling of sexual harassment &amp; misconduct allegations on Nov. 1. “We are a company who believes that in the 21st Century it is important to continually consider and reconsider the best ways to support our employees and strengthen our workplace,” a spokesperson for Airbnb said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “From the beginning, we have sought to build a culture of integrity and respect, and todays changes are just one more step to drive belonging and integrity in our workplace.” Here’s what eBay had to say about its decision: “eBay takes great pride in fostering an inclusive culture that allows employees to feel comfortable and encouraged to report any workplace issues. Weve adjusted our existing employee policy regarding sexual harassment claims to better reflect and encourage eBays values of being open, honest and direct. According to BuzzFeed, Pinterest, Oath, Twitter, Reddit and others have never required mandatory arbitration. Uber, Lyft and Microsoft each put an end to forced arbitration in the last year. Arbitration is a private method of solving a dispute without a judge, jury or right to an appeal. Companies that require forced arbitration waive their employees right to sue and to participate in a class action lawsuit. Throwing out its policy of forced arbitration was one of the five demands disgruntled employees had for Google. In a Medium post l ast week, the walkout organizers commended Googles decision to end forced arbitration while emphasizing the company’s failure to address all of their demands. …”The response ignored several of the core demandslike elevating the diversity officer and employee representation on the boardand troublingly erased those focused on racism, discrimination, and the structural inequity built into the modern day Jim Crow class system that separates full time employees from contract workers. Contract workers make up more than half of Googles workforce, and perform essential roles across the company, but receive few of the benefits associated with tech company employment. They are also largely people of color, immigrants, and people from working class backgrounds.” Google employees began crafting a plan for a company-wide walkout in late October, days after a bombshell New York Times investigation revealed Google had given Android co-creator Andy Rubin a $90 million exit package despite multiple relationships with other Google staffers and accusations of sexual misconduct. Rubin, for his part, has said that the NYTs story contained numerous inaccuracies.",Uber and Lyft put an end to forced arbitration earlier this year.,2018-11-12T21:49:01Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Airbnb ends forced arbitration days after Google, Facebook did the same",http://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/airbnb-ends-forced-arbitration-days-after-google-facebook-did-the-same/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1052001922.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-1,1

Kevin Hartnett,"Early on in the study of quantum computers, computer scientists posed a question whose answer, they knew, would reveal something deep about the power of these futuristic machines. Twenty-five years later, it’s been all but solved. In a paper posted online at the end of May, computer scientists Ran Raz and Avishay Tal provide strong evidence that quantum computers possess a computing capacity beyond anything classical computers could ever achieve. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Raz, a professor at Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Tal, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, define a specific kind of computational problem. They prove, with a certain caveat, that quantum computers could handle the problem efficiently while traditional computers would bog down forever trying to solve it. Computer scientists have been looking for such a problem since 1993, when they first defined a class of problems known as “BQP,” which encompasses all problems that quantum computers can solve. Since then, computer scientists have hoped to contrast BQP with a class of problems known as “PH,” which encompasses all the problems workable by any possible classical computer—even unfathomably advanced ones engineered by some future civilization. Making that contrast depended on finding a problem that could be proven to be in BQP but not in PH. And now, Raz and Tal have done it. The result does not elevate quantum computers over classical computers in any practical sense. For one, theoretical computer scientists already knew that quantum computers can solve any problems that classical computers can. And engineers are still struggling to build a useful quantum machine. But Raz and Tal’s paper demonstrates that quantum and classical computers really are a category apart—that even in a world where classical computers succeed beyond all realistic dreams, quantum computers would still stand beyond them. Quantum Classes A basic task of theoretical computer science is to sort problems into complexity classes. A complexity class contains all problems that can be solved within a given resource budget, where the resource is something like time or memory. Computer scientists have found an efficient algorithm, for example, for testing whether a number is prime. They have not, however, been able to find an efficient algorithm for identifying the prime factors of large numbers. Therefore, computer scientists believe (but have not been able to prove) that those two problems belong to different complexity classes. The two most famous complexity classes are “P” and “NP.” P is all the problems that a classical computer can solve quickly. (“Is this number prime?” belongs to P.) NP is all the problems that classical computers can’t necessarily solve quickly, but for which they can quickly verify an answer if presented with one. (“What are its prime factors?” belongs to NP.) Computer scientists believe that P and NP are distinct classes, but actually proving that distinctness is the hardest and most important open problem in the field. In 1993 computer scientists Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani defined a new complexity class that they called BQP, for “bounded-error quantum polynomial time.” They defined this class to contain all the decision problems—problems with a yes or no answer—that quantum computers can solve efficiently. Around the same time they also proved that quantum computers can solve all the problems that classical computers can solve. That is, BQP contains all the problems that are in P. When thinking about complexity classes, examples help. The “traveling salesman problem” asks whether there’s a path through some number of cities that’s shorter than some given distance. It’s in NP. A more complex problem asks if the shortest path through those cities is exactly that distance. That problem is likely in PH (though it has not been proved to be). But they could not determine whether BQP contains problems not found in another important class of problems known as “PH,” which stands for “polynomial hierarchy.” PH is a generalization of NP. This means it contains all problems you get if you start with a problem in NP and make it more complex by layering qualifying statements like “there exists” and “for all.” 1 Classical computers today can’t solve most of the problems in PH, but you can think of PH as the class of all problems classical computers could solve if P turned out to equal NP. In other words, to compare BQP and PH is to determine whether quantum computers have an advantage over classical computers that would survive even if classical computers could (unexpectedly) solve many more problems than they can today. “PH is one of the most basic classical complexity classes there is,” said Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. “So we sort of want to know, where does quantum computing fit into the world of classical complexity theory?” The best way to distinguish between two complexity classes is to find a problem that is provably in one and not the other. Yet due to a combination of fundamental and technical obstacles, finding such a problem has been a challenge. If you want a problem that is in BQP but not in PH, you have to identify something that “by definition a classical computer could not even efficiently verify the answer, let alone find it,” said Aaronson. “That rules out a lot of the problems we think about in computer science.” Ask the Oracle Here’s the problem. Imagine you have two random number generators, each producing a sequence of digits. The question for your computer is this: Are the two sequences completely independent from each other, or are they related in a hidden way (where one sequence is the “Fourier transform” of the other)? Aaronson introduced this “forrelation” problem in 2009 and proved that it belongs to BQP. That left the harder, second step—to prove that forrelation is not in PH. Which is what Raz and Tal have done, in a particular sense. Their paper achieves what is called “oracle” (or “black box”) separation between BQP and PH. This is a common kind of result in computer science and one that researchers resort to when the thing they’d really like to prove is beyond their reach. The actual best way to distinguish between complexity classes like BQP and PH is to measure the computational time required to solve a problem in each. But computer scientists “don’t have a very sophisticated understanding of, or ability to measure, actual computation time,” said Henry Yuen, a computer scientist at the University of Toronto. So instead, computer scientists measure something else that they hope will provide insight into the computation times they can’t measure: They work out the number of times a computer needs to consult an “oracle” in order to come back with an answer. An oracle is like a hint-giver. You don’t know how it comes up with its hints, but you do know they’re reliable. If your problem is to figure out whether two random number generators are secretly related, you can ask the oracle questions such as “What’s the sixth number from each generator?” Then you compare computational power based on the number of hints each type of computer needs to solve the problem. The computer that needs more hints is slower. “In some sense we understand this model much better. It talks more about information than computation,” said Tal. The new paper by Raz and Tal proves that a quantum computer needs far fewer hints than a classical computer to solve the forrelation problem. In fact, a quantum computer needs just one hint, while even with unlimited hints, there’s no algorithm in PH that can solve the problem. “This means there is a very efficient quantum algorithm that solves that problem,” said Raz. “But if you only consider classical algorithms, even if you go to very high classes of classical algorithms, they cannot.” This establishes that with an oracle, forrelation is a problem that is in BQP but not in PH. Raz and Tal nearly achieved this result almost four years ago, but they couldn’t complete one step in their would-be proof. Then just a month ago, Tal heard a talk on a new paper on pseudorandom number generators and realized the techniques in that paper were just what he and Raz needed to finish their own. “This was the missing piece,” said Tal. The work provides an ironclad assurance that quantum computers exist in a different computational realm than classical computers (at least relative to an oracle). Even in a world where P equals NP—one where the traveling salesman problem is as simple as finding a best-fit line on a spreadsheet—Raz and Tal’s proof demonstrates that there would still be problems only quantum computers could solve. “Even if P were equal to NP, even making that strong assumption,” said Fortnow, “that’s not going to be enough to capture quantum computing.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",Computer scientists have been searching for years for a type of problem that a quantum computer can solve but that any possible future classical computer cannot.

Connie Loizos,"Update: Apologies, I’d written today a breezy — and very wrong — story titled: “Snap’s Evan Spiegel is clinging to billionaire status by his fingernails.” I cited reporting that this remaining 86,657,812 shares are reportedly worth $1.07 billion at this point. What I failed to note — and a source close to the company has brought to my attention — is that those roughly 86 million shares are class A shares only. Spiegel also owns roughly 143.7 million class C shares and another 7.5 million class B shares to safely secure his status as someone worth well over $1 billion, despite the slide in Snap’s share price since its March IPO. I’m very sorry for the screw-up. The original story follows below. It’s hard to fault someone for being barely a billionaire — a self-made one at that, who happens to be just 27 years old. Still, owing to the performance of Snap Inc.’s performance since its March IPO, such is the position of its cofounder and CEO, Evan Spiegel. Spiegel was worth more than three times that amount just nine months ago, when the company made its splashy debut. Hailed initially as a triumph, Snap’s shares opened their first trading day at $24, soaring 41 percent out of the gate. Their price quickly began drifting south, however, as Instagram began more aggressively replicating the features that made Snapchat so popular. Today, its shares trade at just less than $13 each, giving the company a market cap of $15.6 billion, down from a peak valuation of $31 billion. What does it really matter? Not much if Snap’s plans to reinvigorate its business can gain solid footing. As you may have read in TC earlier this month, the company is reversing its stance on several key things. One of them will be to embrace social media influencers, rather than shun them, as was previously the case. Snap had also focused primarily on first-world countries where high-bandwidth video is readily accessible, largely abandoned developing countries. But after missing revenue expectations by $30 million in the third quarter, Spiegel acknowledged on the company’s earnings call that “[Snap needs] to accelerate the adoption of our product among Android users... and users in the rest-of-the-world markets.” Not last the company says it’s prepared to work harder to attract users above the age of 34, a segment to which it was not catering earlier. Snap is also doing more to squeeze revenue out of its users, only 4.5 million who were new to the company in the last quarter. (That amounts to less than three percent user growth quarter over quarter.) As our colleague Josh Constine reported a couple of days ago, for example, Snapchat is looking to win over more businesses with immersive new ads formats. One, called Promoted Stories, strings together multiple Snaps into a longer-form slideshows that can be opened from a tile on the Stories page. A separate initiative, called Augmented Reality Trial ads, allows people to play with an AR version of a product overlaid on the scene surrounding them. Only time will tell if these initiatives make the kind of impact that Spiegel hopes they will. In the meantime, he may have to make do with less. Though he and cofounder Bobby Murphy reportedly sold shares worth $272 million apiece at the time of Snap’s IPO and he has continued to make regularly scheduled stock sales (he sold 1.65 million shares on November 9th at an average price of $12.42, for a total transaction of roughly $20.5 million), his remaining 86,657,812 shares are reportedly worth — eek — $1.07 billion at this point. On the day of Snap’s IPO, they were worth nearly $3.6 billion.","Update: Apologies, I’d written today a breezy — and very wrong — story titled: “Snap’s Evan Spiegel is clinging to billionaire status by his fingernails.” I cited reporting that this remaining 86,657,812 shares are reportedly worth $1.07 billion at this point…",2017-11-26T20:20:09Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Correction: Snap’s Evan Spiegel is still very much a multibillionaire,https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/26/snaps-evan-spiegel-is-still-very-rich/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/9711063387_e7bd4832a8_b.jpg,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-1,1
Darrell Etherington,"Boom Supersonic wants to revitalize and improve the world of supersonic passenger flight, and it now has a new partner on board in its mission – Japan Airlines (JAL), one of the world’s leading passenger flight providers. JAL is putting $10 million into Boom via a strategic investment, and is also going to help Boom with aircraft design and with aspects of the in-flight passenger experience. As part of the arrangement, JAL also now has the option to purchase up to 20 Boom Supersonic aircraft once they become commercially available. This adds to existing orders from airlines that Boom already has in place, bringing its total to 76 aircraft accounted for across five global airlines. JAL has actually already been working with Boom for over a year, according to Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl, but this more clearly formalizes the relationship. Having airline stakeholders closely involved in the development of its aircraft and service plans will work in practice is a huge boon for Boom, which is a very small company with very ambitious goals. Boom is consistently lining up big partners in aviation, however, including Richard Branson’s Virgin Airlines, and Scholl told me this is a key part of its strategic planning. “Each of our deals is designed to be appropriate for the particular context,” Scholl explained via email. “We expect to do many deals with many airlines. Initially, our goal is to select at least one partner in every region of the world. We will continue to engage with other global carriers to maximize the value of JAL’s investment and bring back supersonic commercial travel.” Boom’s aircraft design is intended to be able to achieve speeds of Mach 2.2 during regular cruising flight, and can traverse up to 8,334 km on a single tank with seating for up to 55 customers with Business Class-type comfort and accommodations – as well as airfares in line with current Business Class pricing, despite cutting travel times drastically. In terms of progress on making its supersonic jet a reality, Boom is in the process of selecting a production site for its aircraft, and hopes to have its commercial jet in service by 2023. Its supersonic subscale demonstrator jet, the XB-1, is still on track to fly its first test flight by the end of 2018.","Boom Supersonic wants to revitalize and improve the world of supersonic passenger flight, and it now has a new partner on board in its mission – Japan Airlines (JAL), one of the world’s leading passenger flight providers.

Allison Jones,"TORONTO -- Ontario is considering removing caps on class sizes in kindergarten and in Grades 1 to 3 as the Progressive Conservative government tackles a multi-billion-dollar deficit.
Education Minister Lisa Thompson announced Wednesday that she is launching consultations with education partners on class sizes and teacher-hiring practices.
Currently, the kindergarten class size cap is 29 students, and the average of class sizes across any board can't be more than 26. For the primary grades the cap is 23 students, but at least 90 per cent of classes in any board must have 20 or fewer students.
A government consultation document poses questions such as whether hard caps on class sizes should continue, and if they were removed, what would be an appropriate way to set effective class sizes.
""The province's current fiscal circumstances require an examination of whether changes to class size would allow school boards to deliver better value for government investment,"" the document says, noting that educator staffing costs make up about 80 per cent of government funding to school boards.
Sam Hammond, the president of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, said in a meeting with government officials Wednesday, the officials made it clear they need to work toward balancing the budget.
""Given that, they're going to have to make some difficult decisions and there's no doubt that some of those decisions are going to affect publicly funded education,"" Hammond said, adding that moving from hard caps to a system based on averages ""would be an absolute disaster.""
The government document says the ministry has heard in previous talks that implementing hard caps on class sizes is expensive and difficult for school boards to manage.
""It has been suggested that board-wide class size averages offer more flexibility for classroom organization and allows for more efficient use of board funds,"" the document says.
The consultations are also looking at changes to teacher-hiring practices.
The Tories are in the midst of trying to trim a deficit they peg at $14.5 billion -- though the financial accountability officer says it's closer to $12 billion.
Hammond thinks Wednesday's meeting and consultation is a harbinger of both what's to come in the budget for education, and negotiations that are to start this year ahead of teacher contracts expiring in August.
The previous Liberal government negotiated the last round of teacher and education worker contracts as two-year extensions to existing deals, which ensured they wouldn't have to contend with heated teacher bargaining ahead of the 2018 election.
That deal for elementary teachers came with $56 million to hire teachers and early childhood educators so the current kindergarten cap could be implemented.
Under the existing contracts, high school, elementary, English Catholic and French teachers, as well as support staff, got four per cent salary increases over the two years.
They also got a one-time payment for professional development, supplies and equipment equivalent to a 0.5-per-cent salary increase.",Ontario considers removing caps on kindergarten and primary class sizes CTV News Ontario is considering removing caps on class sizes in kindergarten and in Grades 1 to 3 as the Progressive Conservative government tackles a...

Leigh Anderson,"Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold! For some people, the first freeze of winter is doubly depressing—we’re close to the shortest day of the year, which means we’re not getting a good dose of sunlight, and it’s too cold to go outside and get some exercise and fresh air. But don’t despair! Winter can be a season for hibernation, sure, but if you’re clever and plan ahead, you won’t necessarily start climbing the walls. This AskMetafilter question was posted by a user with mobility issues who hates the forced confinement of freezing temps, and commenters chimed in with many useful suggestions on how to weather the winter with one’s good spirits intact. Below are the indoor-entertainment possibilities that resonated the most with me, but definitely check out the whole thread for even more ideas. 1. Deal with your house In my family, the run-up to Christmas causes me a certain amount of mild anxiety. I know a deluge of new gifts for my kids is coming, and it feels like that water level in our cramped apartment is rising. So take a few evenings or a weekend and cull your closets, shelves, and that pile of stuff by the door (we all have one). Or redecorate a room or sew some new pillow covers or build a bookcase. I know that nothing makes me feel more accomplished than painting a room and hauling a load of stuff to the Good Will. Sprucing up your living space provides a sense of satisfaction; it also just...spruces up your living space. Which is nice when you’re trapped there. For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read 2. Get active for a cause Is the current political environment making you antsy? Do you want to use your time to help other people? You’re not alone. And even if you can’t go door-to-door and attend meetings, you can still do a lot of good work online or on your phone. VolunteerMatch will help you find volunteer opportunities in fields that interest you, and you can filter the results by “virtual opportunities.” (Note—it doesn’t filter perfectly, so you have to read carefully. But there are still lots of chances to help out with web design or admin support for organizations getting off the ground.) If you already have a favorite nonprofit or political candidate, contact them directly and ask how you can help from home. 3. Get completist about a subject This winter I want to learn to play a certain fiddle tune on the guitar in all 12 keys. Will I actually complete it? I doubt it. But by April I might make it through four keys, which is still better than the zero keys I know it in now. I’m also planning a personal mini-class on the Civil War, complete with the Ken Burns documentary and a few thick books already on my nightstand. By the spring I’ll basically have a Ph.D. 4. Host Make people trudge through the snow to you. Put on a pot of stew, bake some bread, and break out the whiskey. How do you think that people in cold climates stay social? Winter is back, and it's colder than ever. Coupled with snow, dry air, sickness, and… Read more Read 5. Get a penpal Postcrossing is something I’ve never heard of, but it seems to be a way to have short correspondences, via postcard, with people all over the world. There are also sites that will match you with more traditional pen pals (check this post out for safety tips before you start). 6. Take an online class Want to bone up on your art history, your calculus, your knife technique? Google around for virtual instruction in whatever subject is grabbing you. I’d probably try some kind of write-your-novel class that would force me to turn in a certain number of pages each week, but there’s obviously a huge range of subjects to choose from. If you live in a snowy place and you don’t have a hot water bottle at the foot of your bed, I’m… Read more Read 7. Proofread Project Gutenberg needs proofreaders for their scanned books. You get to read and help distribute great works of literature at the same time! And of course there are the old cold-weather standbys, like cooking, crafting, and playing music, and the new cold-weather standbys, like video games and social media.

In an updated filing this morning, the ticketing and events company announced plans to sell 10 million Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange at a price range of $19 to $21 under the ticker symbol EB. At a midpoint price, Eventbrite will raise $200 million at a $1.8 billion valuation. The company filed its initial IPO paperwork confidentially back in July, then unveiled its S-1 to about two weeks ago. Eventbrite is not profitable and has been losing money since 2016.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as theyre born: Should we red-shirt him? Will she be ready for kindergarten that soon? Red-shirting, which was originally coined as a term for college athletes who were kept from competing for a year to improve their skills and extend their eligibility, is now often used to describe the act of keeping a child from starting kindergarten for an extra year. Its most common with children who have summer birthdays or a birthday that falls very close to the school districts cut-off date. Whether it is truly at a childs advantage to be red-shirted is up for debate ; but now, a new study indicates that students born in August and who are among the youngest in their kindergarten classes are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Reporter Jenny Anderson writes for Quartz about the study, which was published this week by Harvard Medical School researchers. Heres how a childs birthday can shape their experience in school: Imagine you live in a school district with a Sept. 1 cutoff, meaning your child has to be five years old by Sept. 1 in order to start school. This means that a boy named Lucas, who turned five on Aug. 15, will enroll in the same class as Jack, who will turn six on Sept. 15. Jack has been alive almost 20% longer than little Lucas. Developmentally, this is an eternity. He will likely have better self-control and be better equipped to do the things required in school, like sitting still and listening for long periods of time. As children grow older, small differences in age equalize and dissipate over time, but behaviorally speaking, the difference between a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old could be quite pronounced, said study senior author Anupam Jena, an associate professor of Health Care Policy in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. What is normal for a five-year-old stands out as immature for six-year-olds. The study found that, in districts with a Sept. 1 cutoff date, kids born in August were 34 percent more likely than their almost-a-year-older September peers to receive a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD symptoms can include hyperactivity, inattention, difficulty sitting still, lack of focus or an inability to follow directions. Personally speaking, my husband and I red-shirted our son. He has a late-September birthday and in our school district, the cut-off date is Oct. 1. The closer we got to the time when we had to make a decision, the clearer it was that he would not be readyeither academically or emotionallyto transition from two hours of preschool four days a week to full-day kindergarten a month before he even turned five years old. And his preschool teachers made it clear that they couldnt have agreed more. Luckily, we had the option (and the financial means) to enter him into a preschool program specifically for kids in this situation; it was five days a week and more academically rigorous than the regular 4-year-old program (but less so than kindergarten). And even now, with my son thriving in second grade, I cant imagine he would be thriving in third grade if wed enrolled him a year earlier. But having a choice at all is a luxury many parents dont have. Many parents cant afford another year of daycare or preschool. And one parent in our Offspring Facebook Group felt forced into registering her son for kindergarten in order to keep a variety of educational services in place for him. He was receiving preschool therapies through a school district program for some developmental delays (gross motor, fine motor, speech). Those therapies expire at age 5 with the assumption that your child then continues the therapies through the special school district, says Jennifer, whose son turned five two weeks before the school districts cut-off date of Aug. 1. If I had made him wait a year, his therapies would have stopped and I would have had to pay out of pocket for three therapists for a year and then have him re-evaluated for school district therapies, which they could have rejected. So sending him to school and having him grandfathered into the school district therapies was the only solution that really made sense. Because other parents chose to delay the start of kindergarten, her son ended up in a class with a wide range of ages, which made her wonder: Would he look as far behind if everyone just went when they were 5? Or is he so much more delayed because half of these kids were lucky enough to be able to wait? Other parents in the Facebook group say they haveor still areconsidering everything from a childs social and academic skills to how their physical size compares to kids their age. Some parents factor in their personal experiences of being among the oldest or youngest when they were in school. Or there are some, like Matt, who are choosing what could be considered a compromise: Our current plan is to enroll in kindergarten and see how things go, Matt says. Worst case, he repeats kindergarten a second year. Every kid is different, so each parent needs to make the best decision for their family.","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as they’re born: Should we red-shirt him?

Patrick Allan,"To get the most out of your personal training sessions and workout classes, it helps to be a good client who knows how things work. Plus, it’s always nice to be nice and make things easier for your instructors. We asked several fitness professionals what they wish their clients knew going in and this is what they said. To be a better customer—or at least one that’s not too annoying—it helps to know what it’s like… Read more Read Trainers Aren’t Going to Make You Exercise Several fitness pros expressed that it’s not their job to make you exercise. They’re supposed to guide you through workouts that are right for you, teach you how to do exercise safely and properly, and develop a meal plan that will help you reach your fitness goals. One fitness pro, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that a lot of people go to the gym, but most of those gymgoers don’t know what they’re doing: The Dunning-Kruger Effect seems particularly strong in the gym, probably because of all the ego involved. So many people don’t know what they’re doing, and they have no idea this is the case. Others know enough to see decent progress, but they could be doing better. A personal trainer can at least jump start a beginner’s knowledge and give them resources to move forward. Gym-goers waste a lot of time with bad advice and poor sources, or trying to reinvent the wheel. It’s all about imbuing you with knowledge you can use to better yourself when they’re not around. The hard work has be done by you, not your instructor, says Anthony T., a fitness trainer from Oakland, CA: You don’t pay a trainer to have fun. If anyone knows your journey isn’t easy it’s your trainer, and they didn’t become one overnight. So leave the excuses in your bed. Positive and inspirational energy is the key. Another anonymous instructor agreed, saying: Don’t blame your lack of success on me. You meet with me once a week for 1 hour a week. There are 168 hours in a week. That means that if you really want to make progress you have to do things correctly 167 other hours of the week. Don’t come kill it in the gym with me then go home and eat a whole pizza and drink a bottle of wine and complain that I am not a good trainer. Nobody is going to make you exercise, not even your trainer, so don’t expect them to have some magic ability to get you motivated. Our February push-up challenge ends today! How did the month go for you? What can you do now that… Read more Read You Should Do Research and Shop Around for a Good Fit When you’re looking for a trainer, don’t just sign up with the first person to give you a free session. Michael Borders, a personal trainer at Equinox in New York, NY, says you should find someone who can help you achieve your specific goal: I believe we all could use a different perspective on our fitness goals and be held accountable to someone else—not just our own opinion of what we can and cannot, should and should not be doing in the gym. YouTube is full of BAD info. Shop around, but find a trainer who is passionate about getting you to your goal, whatever it may be. But several fitness pros cautioned that you should do in-depth research on certain trainers before signing up with them. One anonymous trainer pointed out that almost anyone can get a certification: The personal trainer certification is not a rigorous process. There are many certified trainers who have little business instructing others. Some do the bare minimum to pass the test, and then don’t further their education beyond that. Other trainers have a passion for this and they read a ton. It’s important for potential clients to know what to look for in a trainer. Some are very good and knowledgeable, others spread misinformation and taint the industry. Allison Perry seconds those words of caution: Good, knowledgeable fitness instructors are hard to find. There are a LOT of people out there with little to no training (or who flat-out ignore their training recommendations) teaching fitness classes. A lot of gyms don’t even require an audition, or the audition process is a joke. Do some investigating for yourself and find out what qualifications the gym’s instructors have. At the bare minimum, your instructors should have an AFAA or ACE certification as a base, and then any specialty trainings that correspond to what they are teaching. AFAA and ACE also require ongoing continuing education in order to remain current in the certification. However, she goes on to say that a lot of popular specialty fitness certifications are a joke. All they require is that you show to an 8-hour class, so keep that mind when a trainer starts bragging to you about all of their certifications. And if you’re checking out classes, Perry offers some useful advice: Pay attention to how a class is structured. Does the instructor seem organized? Does the music work with the format? Are you getting enough cues? Is the workout balanced (e.g., are you working opposing muscle groups, is the instructor allowing for adequate recovery between sets, etc)? If you try a class and didn’t care for it, consider giving it a go with another instructor. They may have a different personality, music, cues, etc that change the game for you. Last but not least, a few trainers mentioned that a trainer who looks amazing isn’t always the best option. You’re probably better off with someone who is knowledgable and has gone through the same struggles as you. Bouncing on a trampoline is undeniably fun, but how well does that translate to an exercise class?… Read more Read Don’t Be Late to Your Appointments or Classes This should be obvious, but many trainers expressed late clients as their biggest pet peeve. Here’s what one anonymous trainer had to say: For the love of everything, show up on time to your appointment. Good trainers have a plan, and showing up 15 minutes late can throw a wrench into that. Or, at least let us know you’re going to be late. Nothing like a client showing up late and then expecting an hour session crammed into 45 minutes. There is a method to the madness and it doesn’t work like that. Perry echoes those sentiments: Really, I know shit happens, but try not to be late, especially for formats that require setup. For example, if you’ve never taken a Spinning class and you are about to walk in 5-10 minutes late, just skip, make plans for next time, and try to get there early — properly setting up your bike is a process that takes a few minutes and will prevent you from injuring your joints with a bad setup. Anthony T. notes that being late is really only hurting you: When you are late, unprepared, or reschedule often. You’re wasting your own time, money and progress. At the end of the day this whole process is a test of your mental way more than A test of your body. We want to repeat the things to you that will manifest successful thinking. Budget plenty of travel time, leave early, and be ready to roll come training time. Manage Your Expectations Going in It’s great that you want to make a change for the better and be healthier, but it’s a process—and not an easy one. Anthony Ross, an Army Master Fitness trainer, explains: People need to come prepared when they want to work out. I don’t mean that they should have a towel, a trendy water bottle, and some yoga pants. I mean that you have to train your heart and your mind to UNDERSTAND that working out is going to suck for a little while if you haven’t done it in a long time, or if you have never done it. People tell me it’s hard, they are telling me like this is news. No shit! Of course it’s hard, I have to do this every single day, I know it’s hard. Not only is it difficult, but personal trainer Andrew Biernat from Canandaigua, NY, says it will take longer to reach your goals than you think: I wish people knew that the work they put in will fall far short of their expected results. I’d estimate that it takes five to ten times more work to get a result than people think. A person will make a change in their lifestyle and expect that to show up on the scale within a week. When it doesn’t they start to lose hope in the whole process. People can be very fragile when it comes to discomfort, especially when it comes to food and exercise. Biernat recommends you lower your expectations going in and learn to enjoy the process and the challenge. If you make yourself hate your new workout regimen and diet, you won’t do it. Rances Perez, of VIDAproject, agrees: In my opinion, the biggest thing that a person can understand before beginning is that training is a process with a learning curve. Many people start with very grandiose expectations of themselves and when the difficulty sets in—whether it’s the actual exercising, the obstacles of life, or both—they end up feeling horrible and defeated. The key is taking everything one step at a time and not trying to make drastic changes all at once. Stay positive, but keep your goals realistic. Don’t walk up to your trainer on day one and tell them you want washboard abs. You’ll only be disappointed. If you only do one of the sports in a triathlon—swimming, cycling, or running—you’re safe for now.… Read more Read It Might Look Like an Easy Job, But It’s Not From the outside, being a fitness trainer or class instructor looks like a pretty simple gig, right? Not so much. It’s a job, just like any other, and it takes a lot of work to do it right. At the very least, Anthony Ross asks you do your trainer the kindness of listening to what they say and following their instructions: Listen to your trainer, they may not always look like some dude from Baywatch, but they are a trainer for a reason. They know things that you don’t, so let them do their thing. Also, be aware that personal training is more than just showing up and watching you exercise. Andrew Biernat explains that they’re watching you for a reason: As a trainer, I need to know the body very well and be ready to correct something at a moment’s notice based on the way it looks, almost like a spider-sense. And that’s the easy part compared to the psychological deep dive of motivating and encouraging people to do hard work consistently. Also, they’re working for you when you’re not even there, says Scott Drapeau of Irons Sight Barbell Club in Lacey, WA: I’d like them all to know how much effort is put in behind the scenes. For every hour I spend training, I spend at least 3 more preparing notes, scheduling workouts, and making sure what you’re doing is safe and effective for your goals. So don’t ignore that effort your trainer is putting in, says Anthony T.: Yes, it can take hours to plan a perfect routine and meal plan, so don’t waste our efforts behind the scenes on distractions. Trust the process you’ll be happy you did. Lastly, Allison Perry says if you enjoyed a class or session, let your trainer or instructor know. Being a fitness professional is often a thankless job because people assume it’s easy to do. Be Honest With Your Trainers and Instructors You might be embarrassed by your physical ability, diet, or lifestyle choices, but lying to your instructors about that stuff won’t help you get healthier, says Anthony T.: We can’t train liars, and of course we can tell. If you have been sticking to your nutrition plan and fitness routine there’s no reason other than extreme stress for not achieving the steps to your goals each week. It’s my job to be critical and change your perception of your life when it comes to your health. Trainers don’t wake up to be mean to you. We’re actually Nice people who aren’t afraid to speak truthfully about your progress. We wake up to inspire you and locate that part of you that turns off excuses and starts finding solutions. If you’re new to all of this, don’t be afraid to say so, even in a class environment. Perry recommends you have a chat with your instructor before class so they know you’re new and might need some help. Ross agrees: If you don’t know how to do an exercise, or what an exercise is doing for you: ASK!!! It’s also important to be upfront with trainers about what you’re comfortable with. If you prefer to have them not manually adjust you while you exercise, let them know. And don’t hesitate to give your trainer a call, says Anthony T.: You can call your trainer anytime to vent, ask for health and fitness advice, or get motivation when you feel like it’s getting crazy. I’m even willing to think of a meal alternative to order if you got weak and pulled into a drive-thru. When in doubt, be honest and talk to them. This one is for the beasts out there.

JAMES PONIEWOZIK,"Was it? Roseanne Barr the performer is pro-Trump; so is Roseanne the character. But “Roseanne” the show was less pro-Trump than pro-Roseanne, working to assure the audience that, whether you thought she was right or wrong, she meant well. Her argument with Jackie, for instance, mostly sidestepped questions of racism, or xenophobia, or Mr. Trump’s dog-whistle nostalgia for “the old days.” Instead, she said that Mr. Trump (though not mentioned by name on the show) “talked about jobs.” Was that the only reason she voted for him? I don’t know. But I 100 percent believe that’s what she would say her motivation was. People sell themselves, all the time, on the most charitable interpretations of their actions. But the following week’s episode had an offhand line that suggested there was a kind of white-identity politics under the surface here. The Conners woke up in front of the TV, having slept through, Dan said, “all the shows about black and Asian families.” (The reference was to “black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat,” the only two such sitcoms on ABC.) “They’re just like us,” Roseanne said. “There, now you’re all caught up.” The line felt like a sarcastic slap. Ms. Barr defended it on Twitter as “ a joke about class solidarity.” If so, it was a weird one because 1) both of the referenced shows are about more affluent families; 2) if Ms. Barr knows how to do one thing, it’s to make sure you know sarcasm when she delivers it; and 3) if the line were about class solidarity, it would be … not really a joke but simply a statement. The season’s seventh episode left less ambiguity. In “Go, Cubs!” Roseanne met her new Muslim neighbors, who she was afraid are terrorists. The publicity for the episode emphasized that Ms. Barr wanted her character to get a “comeuppance” for her prejudice.","The sitcom’s revival was a topical hit, but the political pot-stirring — onscreen and off — overshadowed the show’s strengths.",2018-05-23T00:31:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Critic’s Notebook: It Was ‘Roseanne’ vs. ‘Roseanne,’ in a Polarizing Revival",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/arts/television/roseanne-season-finale-roseanne-barr.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/arts/television/23roseanne-2/23roseanne-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1
Kate Clark,"Women in tech are not only significantly under-funded by venture capitalists, but they also often lack access to the early-stage support granted to their male counterparts. To enroll in a startup accelerator like Y Combinator, for example, its expected founders relocate to the Bay Area for three months. Women, who are more often caregivers, might not be able to do that, and even if they can, the program may not cater to their specific needs. Female Founders Alliance (FFA), a relatively new network of female startup founders, has built a free, non-dilutive 5-week accelerator for women by women. Called ‘Ready, Set, Raise,’ its goal is to help more female-founded startups raise VC through workshops, 1-on-1 coaching, legal clinics, communications and speech coaching and more. The accelerator, sponsored by Trilogy Equity Partners, kicked off at the end of August and will culminate with a private demo day with VCs in Seattle on September 27th. “I don’t know many women who can uproot their families for three months to go live in another city,” FFA founder Leslie Feinzaig told TechCrunch. “When I was working on my company, I wanted to apply to Y Combinator but I was a new mom, it was 100% a non-starter.” Feinzaig knows the trials and tribulations of raising VC as a female entrepreneur all too well. As the founder of an edtech startup called Venture Kits, she tried, unsuccessfully, to procure venture backing. That struggle is why she started FFA, which began as a Facebook group to connect female founders in the Seattle area but has expanded across North America. The accelerator is designed to allow founders to tune into the programming remotely. Participants are only required to be on-site in Seattle, where FFA is based, for one week, during which the organization is providing free housing and childcare. FFA’s accelerator is among a new class of efforts created for women in tech. All Raise’s Founders For Change initiative, for example, and new female-focused funds, like Sarah Kunst’s Cleo Capital, are all working to close the gender funding gap. “I know it seems to people like there’s a lot happening around female founders and diverse founders, but in the context of the size and scale of that gender gap, we are barely getting started,” Feinzaig said. “We need all the accelerators. We need hundreds of funds. We are nowhere close to making a real dent in equal leadership.” Today, FFA is announcing their inaugural class of startups, eight in total. Here’s a closer look at the group: Chanlogic : Based in Seattle, the SaaS startup provides a product for e-commerce channel managers. Esq.Me Inc. : A Portland-based document marketplace for lawyers created by lawyers. Future Sight AR : A Houston-based AR product for engineering, procurement and construction companies. geeRemit : Based in Raleigh, the startup leverages the blockchain to power remittances to Africa. Magic AI : A Seattle-based AI startup for livestock care. MoxieReader : Based in New York, an edtech startup focused on improving child literacy through tech. Pandere Shoes : Based in Anchorage, the startup is creating expandable shoes.

Jake Bright,"The seven African-focused companies which presented as part of Y Combinator’s 200 strong cohort of Winter 2019 class of 200 startups may seem like a small percentage for such a large class, but it represents the growing significance of African ventures in YCs universe.
Since 2016, the Silicon Valley acceleratorthat provides seed funds and mentorship for early stage startupshas backed 25 companies located in Africa and another 10 with an Africa product focus, according to YC spokesperson Lindsay Amos.
Past YC Africa alumns covered here at TechCrunch include payments startup Paystack, logistics firm Kobo360, and VOD startup Afrostream (now shuttered).
Of the 7 Africa-oriented YC class who presented at demo day 2019, 5 originated in Nigeria and 1 in Tanzania. All 7 are fintech ventures with products targeted across currency trading, agriculture, healthcare, and education.
Heres the skinny on the Africa focused startups that presented at Demo Day 2019.
Nala (Tanzania): A fintech service building internet-free mobile payments for Africa. Nala lets users pay bills, do p2p payments, and purchase cell phone minutes without an internet connection. The startup’s app is one of Google PlayStore’s Top Free Finance Apps in Tanzania, according to founder Benjamin Fernandes. Nala plans to leverage the seed funding and exposure from YC participation to raise additional capital to close its first seed round, he told TechCrunch.
54gene (Nigeria): 54gene aims to be the 23andMe for Africa. The company says that competitor data is limited because their users are mostly white. By focusing on Africa, the company can help detect and identify DNA markers that might otherwise go overlooked. Co-founder Abasi Ene-Obong has a PhD in cancer biology from the University of London.
VertoFX (UK): VertoFX is a B2B currency marketplace and international payment provider for frontier markets with an initial target market of Africa. The platform allows businesses to gain easy access to foreign currencies and make international payments seamlessly, providing clients with real-time and cheaper exchange rates, liquidity, and faster settlement periods. VertoFX’s founders are ex-bankers Anthony Oduwole and Ola Oyetayo. In an email to TechCrunch Oduu said there are currently 18 currencies on the platform and the ability to settle in 120 countries, including China and the U.S. 
Thrive Agric (Nigeria): The company helps smallholder farmers in Nigeria access crowdfunded loans to help grow their crops, as well as help them sell their produce. The company has worked with 14,000 farmers to date, with plans to reach 1,000,000 farmers across Africa by 2022 in what it says is a $54 billion market opportunity.
CredPal (Nigeria): A credit card company that allows consumers in Africa to make purchases across online and offline merchants and pay in fixed monthly installments. CredPal touts it cards as having the convenience of a credit card and the simplicity of fixed monthly repayments. The purpose is reducing the financial pressure faced by consumers in Africa and also improving their standard of living. The scope is Africa and it is currently operational in Nigeria. Founders are Fehintolu Olaogun and Olorunfemi Jegede.
Schoolable (Nigeria): Provides simple finance solutions for schools in Africa. There are 65 million students in Africa attending private schools, but tuition payments can be a pain point for parents paying for their childs education. Thats because tuition payments are often due upfront and its more difficult than it should be for schools to keep track of payments. Schoolable is creating an invoicing app that helps ensure parents make payments on time, while also using the app to save directly for tuition.
Wallet.NG (Nigeria): A fintech app that allows people to send money to friends or family and pay bills with only the recipient’s phone number. Wallet helps users keep track of their spending through financial reporting available on the app.","The seven African-focused companies which presented as part of Y Combinator’s 200 strong cohort of Winter 2019 class of 200 startups may seem like a small percentage for such a large class, but it represents the growing significance of African ventures in YC’…",2019-03-20T11:46:03Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Seven Africa-focused startups present at Y Combinator’s Demo Day,http://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/seven-africa-focused-startups-present-at-y-combinators-demo-day/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Y-Cominbator-Africa-Nala.jpg?w=419,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-1,1
Bryan Menegus,"Embattled electric car manufacturer Tesla racked up its third class-action suit, filed this evening in California’s Northern District Court, stemming from bizarre and potentially unfounded tweets sent last week by CEO Elon Musk. The first such suit was filed Friday by Tesla short seller Kalman Isaacs, who contended that the tweets were solely intended to manipulate the company’s stock price—a move that’s estimated to have cost Isaacs and those making similar bets upwards of $1 billion. Those advocating for or actually shorting his electric car venture have rankled Musk, who went so far as to call such traders “ jerks who want us to die.” Another, similar class-action—Chamberlain v Tesla—came the same day. Interestingly, John Yeagar, the plaintiff in this new suit, was not a short seller at all. His suit states that “the fraudulent nature of Musk’s statements was uncovered over the next two days when neither Tesla nor Musk substantiated Musk’s claim that there was secure financing for a going-private transaction at $420 a share” and causing the stock price to drop from “$379.57 per share, on August 7, 2018, to close at $352.27 per share, on August 9, 2018.” One assumes Yeagar jumped at the opportunity to buy Tesla stock and then sell it off at the proposed $420 per share price tag, only to see its value drop after investors began to question the veracity of Musk’s claims. Yeagar’s filing reiterates what much of what the prior suits allege: that despite affirmative statements from Musk of having secured proper investment to go private, no such plans had been made. In essence, what was initially considered to be a stupid weed joke has cost Musk the goodwill of Tesla fans (or at least those seeking to profit from his offer to go private at $420), deepened his already contentious relationship with short sellers, led to an SEC investigation, and could potentially cost him quite a losses in court. Given the enormity of consequences, perhaps there’s some credence to Azealia Banks’s accusation of the CEO tweeting while tripping on LSD, given that main the alternative explanation is Musk engaging in obvious, poorly-executed fraud.","Embattled electric car manufacturer Tesla racked up its third class-action suit, filed this evening in California’s Northern District Court, stemming from bizarre and potentially unfounded tweets sent last week by CEO Elon Musk.

Jon Russell,"Alibaba is investing big bucks into offline distribution. The Chinese e-commerce giant has forked out $2.23 billion in exchange for a sizeable piece of Focus Media, a Shanghai-based company that operates outdoor digital advertising screens across China, Singapore and Hong Kong, according to a U.S. filing. The deal itself is broken up into a few pieces. Alibaba itself is paying $1.43 billion for a 6.62 percent share of Focus Media, which is listed in Shanghai, It is also spending $504.7 million to buy 10 percent of an entity (managed by Focus Media founder and chairman Jason Nanchun Jiang) which controls 23.34 percent of Focus Media. In addition, an Alibaba-aligned fund called ‘New Retail Strategic Opportunities’ is buying 1.37 percent of Focus Media, while Alibaba itself is planning to exercise an option to buy five percent more of the business over the next twelve months. That additional transaction will add another $1 billion or so to the total investment, dependent, of course, on Focus Media’s stock price. That’s quite a mouthful but the objective of the deal is simpler to grok: Alibaba already has a formidable online channel to interact with consumers and now it is expanding what it can do offline. Focus Media currently claims to reach 200 million middle-class consumers across 300 Chinese cities via its outdoor advertising platform, which includes digital screens in streets, in subways and in elevators. The company plans to grow that to 500 million people across 500 cities, and that ties into Alibaba’s online-to-offline strategy, which it also calls ‘New Retail.’ That has seen the company buy up expensive stakes in offline retail businesses with the goal of marrying the benefits of online shopping — such as quick delivery, easy to find products and easy payment — with the customer experience of brick and mortar stores, like in-person customer service and try-before-you-buy. It isn’t hard to imagine a scenario in which a consumer sees a product advertised via Focus Media with the option to buy it, or arrange to see it in a store, simply by scanning a QR code. (Lest you forgot, QR codes are huge in China and a very key component in online/offline shopping.) Beyond the New Retail push, the distribution provided by Focus Media offers sellers on Alibaba’s e-commerce platform an alternative avenue through which to reach potential customers, particularly within China’s growing middle class. Will people reject being bombarded with ads on their commute or downtime, especially when they could just open an app on their phone? Alibaba likely isn’t keen to take the risk, and given the vast amount of cash it is sitting on this deal isn’t going to be a huge risk.","Alibaba is investing big bucks into offline distribution.

Mat Smith,"The startup showcased the portable muscle recovery tool at CES, and it's backed up by several scientific papers that elaborate on the medical applications of active compression. On the Spryng, there are three different intensity modes and patterns, but the focus is more on active compression, affecting your circulation in a positive way, rather than the wonderful massage feeling the Spryng conferred to my worn-out legs.
The jury is out on compression tights and tops (but if it makes you feel better— why not?), but compression therapy has more tangible benefits to blood circulation issues, like deep vein thrombosis, diabetes and more.
That was apparently the initial aim for this wearable, and the startup is looking to pick up FDA approval for a Class 2 device (it's currently Class 1) so that the Spryng can be used in a medical context. Interestingly, the degree of massage for medical usage is actually less than the settings used for recovery.
I may have over-zealously leapt into some fitness-based new year's resolutions the weekend before CES started. Too many squats or deadlifts means suffering was just one sleep away. With some very stiff hamstrings, I tried used the Spryng to aid my recovery. Depending on your choice of pants, while a little bulky, both wraps fit under looser trousers. They inflate only a little externally, but the internal force is surprisingly powerful.
""It's pretty simple. It focuses on the lower limbs, as the calf muscles are responsible for pumping blood back up to the upper body and the heart,"" said Spryng's ""Chief of Recovery"", Heshika Deegahawathura.
He notes that existing compression solutions from medical manufacturers are bulky, and not all that accessible. According to the team, Spryng is for ""day-to-day runners"". The main theory is that by pinpointing the calves, the benefits transfer to your circulatory system as a whole. Deegahawathura adds: ""[Runners] don't want to stay around to recover, they want to go out after they've finished their run. They want to go have a drink, do something else.""
With an infrared emitter and receiver on the pair of wraps, they can be used synchronized or on their own, and you're free to walk around, sit, or stand while they're working. I think there's a lot of benefit to the therapeutic feel of the device -- it's not excessively aggressive, and felt like my calves were being massaged. There's a charging port and while there is a Bluetooth radio, the team isn't yet offering a companion app with remote controls.
Some of the studies done regarding active compression suggest it can improve performance up to 50%, but think of that as the best possible scenario. My aching legs did feel better, but there's limits to how much compression can aid recovery. Anything that helps is a good thing, however, and the Spryng came into its own after we'd spent an entire week marching around exhibition halls in Vegas.
Priced at $129, the wearable is on sale at Spryng's official site.","If you wanted to simplify, CES 2019 could be neatly divided into self-driving cars, giant TVs and health tech.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"The committee also forecast that taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would see, as a group, large tax increases in 2027, if the individual tax cuts in the bill expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. Those tax increases would be relative to current law — meaning that those taxpayers would be worse off in 2027 than they would have been if the bill had not become law. Senate Democrats say the bill hurts the poor; Republicans say it’s a ‘mirage. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, called the joint committee analysis “astounding” and warned that middle-class taxpayers would get “clobbered” under the latest Republican plan. “When you’re reaching for the cranberry sauce, Republicans are going be reaching for your pocketbooks to give handouts to multinational corporations,” Mr. Wyden said. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the finance committee, said that the appearance of a tax increase was a mirage that is the result of arcane scoring rules. Because people will no longer have to purchase health insurance, they may no longer receive tax credit subsidies for insurance that they do not purchase. “Without those credits, they see an overall uptick in their tax liability,” Mr. Hatch said. The debate then devolved into an argument over what really counts as an increase and the murkiness of government scorekeeping, which Senator Patrick Toomey, the Republican of Pennsylvania, called “ridiculous.” Uninterested in letting go of numbers that supported his argument that the Republican tax plan is bad for the middle class, Mr. Wyden dismissed Mr. Toomey’s concerns. “I’ve never heard a senator try to psychoanalyze a Joint Committee on Taxation table,” he said. Today’s vote is but the first of several to come. The House is poised on Thursday to pass a sweeping rewrite of the tax code along party lines and lawmakers are making their last-ditch statements for and against the bill. The legislation, which would include a $1.5 trillion tax cut, was expected to pass the House. But several New Jersey and New York Republicans are expected to oppose the bill because it eliminates the ability of taxpayers to deduct state and local income and sales taxes and caps property tax deductions at $10,000. Democrats are also opposed to the bill, saying it will not help the middle-class and will help the wealthiest Americans. Even if it passes, this is not the end of the debate. The Senate is still discussing its version of the bill and the Senate Finance Committee is expected to vote on the legislation on Friday. The full Senate is expected to vote after Thanksgiving. Here are some of the latest developments and comments from lawmakers as the House stands on the precipice of a momentous tax cut. Some Northeast Republicans are saying ‘No.’ “I just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,” Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, who plans to vote against the bill, said at a news conference. “You’re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere,” Mr. Zeldin said. At least five Republicans from New York plan to vote against the tax bill including Mr. Zeldin: Dan Donovan, John J. Faso, Peter T. King and Elise Stefanik. And at least three from New Jersey also intend to vote no: Leonard Lance, Frank A. LoBiondo and Christopher H. Smith. Mr. Donovan, the lone House Republican from New York City, said he and his New York colleagues wanted to cut taxes.”But not on the backs of our constituents,” he said. Outside the Northeast, many Republicans are saying ‘Yes.’ Photo Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, this month. Credit Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency “For the first time in 31 years we are wiping the tax code clean and replacing it with one that is fairer and simpler for everyone,” said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. “For almost a decade, Americans suffered under Obamanomics,” said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas. “Their savings remained decimated, their paychecks were stagnant, and their American dreams were diminished.” Now, he declared, “a new day has dawned.” “We are on the precipice of passing a fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive tax code, one built for three percent-plus economic growth,” Mr. Hensarling said. And Democrats are calling the bill a ‘horror show’ and a ‘missed opportunity.’ “This is a horror show today,” Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “This is a horror show debate. This is a horror show process. But it’s a disaster for the American people. The bill we are debating today will abandon millions of American families.” “This is a historic moment, but most importantly it’s a missed opportunity,” said Representative Richard Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts. “What we’re being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class Americans.” Photo Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, last week. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times Another Democrat, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, began shouting from the lectern about the drawbacks of the bill. “Republicans and President Trump are doling out tax breaks for companies to move overseas but will take away benefits to hire American veterans right here at home.” “On behalf of hard working Americans throughout this country I say vote no on HR 1. Vote no on HR 1 percent.” Continue reading the main story","The House is expected to approve a $1.5 trillion tax cut, though several New Jersey and New York Republicans may join Democrats in opposing the bill.",2017-11-16T17:05:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Live Briefing: Trump Heads to Capitol Hill as House Prepares to Vote on Tax Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/tax-bill-house-vote.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/17/us/politics/17dc-taxbriefing4/17dc-taxbriefing4-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1

"A.E. Dwyer on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Chicken stew on toast, however delicious, lacks sophistication. Now pour that stew into an elegant edible vessel? Thrilling. Crisp. Like a golden chalice of cream sauce. Now thats downright ladylike. The good news is even if youre not feeling particularly ladylike, this dish is scrumptious to all manner of persons. Meet Chicken à la Kinga dish so old, its new again.
According to The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Chicken à la King was not made for royalty, but rather the lunch set of Philadelphias fashionable Bellevue Hotel in the early 1900s. William King, a cook at the hotel, created the version that became his namesake, a dish that included truffle, red and green peppers. It was particularly appealing to the ladies who frequented the tea room, seen as a dainty dish that didnt require a knife to eat. Little did they know it contained about as many calories as a large cheeseburger.
My great-grandmother was a renowned family cook, who had attended The Antoinette Pope School of Fancy Cookery in Chicago. (Fun fact: Pope only charged 75 cents per class when she opened in 1930.) My great-grandmothers chicken creaming skills filtered down through her culinary education to my grandmothers dinner plate. And it stuck. After some tweaks, Chicken à la King became the default fancy dish made for Dwyer-family wedding buffets, elegant lunches, even the occasional Easter.
This recipe call for puff pastry shells, a nod to French pastry vol-au-vent: whisper-thin pastry cases used to contain rich bites of meats and creamed things. To me, they are a requirement to enjoying Chicken à la King, at least the first time around. The second day (when youre out of shells) youre allowed to go for a thick slice of toasted white bread. As kids, we would watch in awe as the pastry shellsor nests as they were marketed to usemerged from the oven, tall, golden and flaky. My sister and I managed to denude nest after nest of their small golden hats before we got caught.
The appearance of Chicken à la King is important: tender white meat chicken, silky white sauce, bright accent vegetables. No unsightly brown and grey bits of dark meat, nor even black pepper flakes, are allowed to besmirch the creamy whiteness. If you have it and you like it, use white pepper. Green peas add a fresh, sweet snap and pimentos add a subtle piquancy to the sauce. Drain those suckers wellwe dont want a pink tinted final dish, please.
Poaching in broth infused with carrot, celery, onion, peppercorn and thyme saves the chicken breast from being dry and flavorless. Bonus: Youll end up with tasty leftover stock, which can be chilled and frozen for soupy emergencies. 
Thickening with egg yolks became outmoded, when eggs were deemed pariahs for selfishly inflicting their cholesterol on our unwitting population. Now that yolks are cool again, I say bring them back as a thickener. Ill take my Vitamin D, lipids, and choline from yolks over canned soup goo any day.
So go ahead and make a fancy lunch for your friends. Make them my Chicken à la King, and put your best chicken foot forward.
1 package of Puff Pastry Shells (6 count), baked according to package instructions
For the chicken and poaching liquid:
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 bouillon cube or 4 cups chicken broth
1 small stalk celery, chopped in large chunks
1 small carrot, chopped in large chunks
1 wedge of onion, skinned
A few peppercorns or grinds of fresh pepper
A few thyme sprigs
Salt to taste
For the cream sauce:
1 stick of butter
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 cup whole or 2-percent milk
2 1/2 cups of reserved chicken poaching liquid
2 small jars of pimentos (2 oz. each), well drained
1 cup of frozen peas
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream
Salt to taste
Ground white pepper (optional)
Bring four cups of broth (or water with chicken bouillon cube added) to a simmer in a wide shallow pot with the lid. Add celery, carrots, onion, salt, pepper, and thyme and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and reduce heat to very low. After 15 minutes, check to see if chicken is cooked through, and remove the breasts from the broth. Continue cooking for another five minutes if chicken is not quite done yet.
Strain the broth and set aside 2 1/2 cups for your cream sauce. Discard the solids. 
Melt one stick of butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, then whisk in flour. Whisk thoroughly to combine, then let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally. Pour in milk and broth, and whisk to incorporate, making sure to whisk in any flour from the sides of the pan. Let cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Reduced the heat to keep the mixture warm.
In a bowl, combine the egg yolks and heavy cream, then slowly stir in 1/3 cup of the hot milk-broth mixture, mixing well. Pour this mixture back into your pot with the broth and whisk quickly to combine. This step will prevent the yolks from curdling. 
Cube your cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add chicken, pimentos, and peas to the broth mixture and stir, letting everything warm through. Taste and season with salt, adding a pinch of ground white pepper if desired.
Ladle the Chicken à la King into your waiting nests. Et Voila!","Chicken stew on toast, however delicious, lacks sophistication. Now pour that stew into an elegant edible vessel? Thrilling. Crisp.

Lucas Matney,"One Denver-based startup’s long-shot bid to move today’s commercial jets beyond supersonic speeds just got a big injection of cash.
Boom Supersonic, which is building and designing what it calls the “worlds first economically viable supersonic airliner,” announced today that they’ve closed a $100 million Series B funding round led by Emerson Capital. Other investors include Y Combinator Continuity, Caffeinated Capital, SV Angel, Sam Altman, Paul Graham, Ron Conway, Michael Marks and Greg McAdoo.
The startup has raised $140 million to date.
“Today, the time and cost of long-distance travel prevent us from connecting with far-off people and places,” said Boom CEO Blake Scholl in a statement. “Overture fares will be similar to todays business classwidening horizons for tens of millions of travelers. Ultimately, our goal is to make high-speed flight affordable to all.
Alongside the fund raise, Boom is further detailing its plans to begin testing its Mach-2.2 commercial airliner this year. The company is aiming to launch a 1:3 scale prototype of its planned Overture airliner this year called the XB-1. The two-seater plane will serve to validate the technologies being built for the full-sized jet.
The startup’s supersonic Overture jet will hold 55 passengers, and the team hopes that the costs of flying more than double the speed of sound will be comparable to today’s business class ticket prices. $100 million may seem like a lot of money, but the development costs for lengthy projects like these can quickly race past estimates.
The company already has pre-orders from Virgin Group and Japan Airlines for 30 airliners .","One Denver-based startup’s long-shot bid to move today’s commercial jets beyond supersonic speeds just got a big injection of cash.

Kirsten Korosec,"What3words, a startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned three words to each one, has disclosed three new investors all from the automotive world. What3words announced Thursday that the venture arm of China’s largest auto group SAIC Motor, Formula 1 champion Nico Rosberg, and audio and navigation systems company Alpine Electronics have invested in the London-based company. Existing investor Intel Capital also participated in the round. The latest funding round will be used to expand into new markets and product developments. The investment, which was not disclosed, illustrates interest in the industry for technology that simplifies the user experience in cars, can be easily used with voice commands, and prepares companies for the age of autonomous vehicles. Since, the addressing system gives a unique three-word combination to a location it fixes a major flaw with a lot of voice-operated navigation systems: duplicate street names. The company has assigned these 57 trillion squares a unique three-word name using an algorithm that has a vocabulary of 25,000 words. The system, which anyone can use via the what3words app, is available in more than a dozen languages. For instance, if you want to meet a friend in a specific corner of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you can send the three-word address prices.slippery.traps. An Airbnb host might use a three word address to direct a guest to a tricky entrance. Someday, riders might be able to say or type in a three-word address to direct a self-driving car to drop them off a specific entrance at a large sports arena. “This fund raise cements the direction this company is going,” What3words CEO Chris Sheldrick told TechCrunch. “Which is how, in the future, we are going to tell cars and devices and voice assistants where we’re going.” Earlier this year, what3words disclosed that Daimler had taken 10% stake in the company. Daimler’s stake and these recently revealed investors are all part of its Series C funding round. The company’s novel global addressing system has been integrated into in Mercedes’ new infotainment and navigation system—called the Mercedes-Benz User Experience or MBUX. The MBUX debuted on the new Mercedes A-Class, a hatchback that went on sale outside the U.S. in the spring. A sedan variant of the A-Class will come to the U.S. market in late 2018. TomTom also announced plans last month to integrate what3words into its mapping and navigation products in the second half of this year. TomTom supplies its automotive navigation and traffic technology to car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Citroën and Peugeot. The company is in talks with other automakers and suppliers to get what3words integrated into vehicle infotainment systems.","What3words, a startup that has divided the entire world into 57 trillion 3-by-3 meter squares and assigned three words to each one, has disclosed three new investors all from the automotive world.

"Catherine E. Shoichet and Priscilla Alvarez, CNN","(CNN)It could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border, officials said in a court filing.
The government's proposed plan, detailed for the first time in documents filed late Friday night, outlines a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review.
The court filing comes a year after a memo from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially created the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy, which eventually led to the separation of thousands of immigrant families. While a federal court order forced the reunification of many of those families, an explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more who hadn't previously been acknowledged by officials.
And a federal judge last month ruled that this group should be included in the class-action lawsuit over family separations. 
The judge's order was a major blow for the Trump administration, which had argued finding these families would be too burdensome a task. And it now presents a major logistical challenge for the government.
Several factors complicate the process, officials said in Friday's court filing:
 All the children from this group of separated families have already been released from government custody
 US Customs and Border Protection didn't start tracking separated families as a searchable data set in its records before April 19, 2018
 A manual review alone would ""overwhelm ORR's existing resources"" because teams would have to comb through nearly 50,000 case files
Instead of taking that approach, officials propose using data analysis to hone in on which records are likely to be separated children, and then to embark on more painstaking manual reviews. The process, officials said, would take ""at least 12 months, and possibly up to 24 months.""
A team of officials representing the Department of Health and Human Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection would lead the effort, the filing said. They would then convene a data analysis team led by a senior biostatistician. 
Last month, US District Judge Dana Sabraw issued a 14-page ruling modifying the class definition, following revelations that the government had been separating families as far back as July 1, 2017, months before the controversial ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy was announced. Officials estimated that the children were separated, received by HHS for care and released prior to Sabraw's June 26, 2018, court order ordering a halt to most family separations at the US border.
Plaintiffs ""request that the government identify the families whom it separated on or after July 1, 2017 whose children were released from ORR before June 26, 2018,"" according to a court document late last month. They note that the government should ""start the process immediately."" The government had proposed submitting a proposal on next steps ""on or before April 5, 2019.""
The Ms. L, et al. vs. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, et al., case was initially prompted by the separation of a Congolese woman and her 7-year-old daughter. The American Civil Liberties Union originally filed the case last year and it was later expanded to become a class action lawsuit.
Last June, Sabraw issued a preliminary injunction blocking most family separations at the US-Mexico border and ordered the government to reunite the families it had divided.
Since then, the administration has provided regular reports to the court on the reunification status of children and parents whom the government separated, including some parents who were deported but ultimately elected not to be reunified with their children.
As of March 25, 2019, the government has discharged 2,749 of 2,814 possible children of potential class members, up eight since the last status report on March 6.","It could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border, officials said in a court filing.",2019-04-06T13:36:45Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","It may take 2 years to identify thousands of separated families, government says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/06/politics/family-separations-plan/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190404095946-01-zero-tolerance-tl-june-2018-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-1,1

HALIL M. KARAVELI,"In fact, the history of Turkey has been shaped by class politics that are obscured by a misleading narrative that pits Islamization against secularism. Closer inspection reveals that Turkeys secularists and Islamists represent the two shades of the same right-wing ideology, which includes a commitment to unrestrained capitalism, hostility to labor, conservatism and nationalism.
Mr. Ataturks secular reforms laid the foundations of a modern capitalist society, but for his successors it has made sense to use Islam to protect capitalism. With the onset of the Cold War, Turkeys ruling, ostensibly secular elite opted for Islamization to check leftist politics, and religious education was reintroduced in 1946.
The rise of socialist student and labor movements in the 1960s and of a democratic left in the 1970s prompted the military to step in to crush the left. Gen. Kenan Evren, who took power in 1980 after a coup, called upon the people to firmly embrace our religion to ward off the threat of socialism. His junta made religious education mandatory, opened new religious schools and continued to populate the state bureaucracy with members of religious fraternities, who were reliable anti-socialists.
The military junta also imposed a neoliberal order that the business class had been calling for; it banned trade unions and incarcerated their leaders and activists, together with hundreds of thousands of other leftists.
Mr. Erdogan rose to power promising to serve the same capitalist interests. He embraced the neoliberal economics of the generals and was endorsed by the secular, westernized business barons who did not mind his religious conservatism.
The Islamic conservatives recast the class conflict as a cultural conflict between the people and the elite. They won by championing the religious culture of the masses, but privileged the interests of the economic elite after coming to power. 
Mr. Erdogans populism notwithstanding, income inequalities have grown under Mr. Erdogan. The richest 1 percent of the population has increased its share of the national wealth by 43 percent, putting it in possession of 54 percent of the countrys wealth.",The opposition parties challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offer another version of the right-wing nationalism of his party and its nationalist partner.,2019-04-08T10:00:08Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Rise and Rise of the Turkish Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/opinion/turkey-nationalism-right-wing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/08/opinion/08karaveliSub/08karaveliSub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1
Bryan Menegus,"Both Uber and Lyft have been subpoenaed by San Francisco’s city attorney for information on driver classification, wages, and benefits to see if the ridesharing companies are compliant, Reuters reports. Among other documentation, the subpoenas seek “a complete list of drivers who began or ended at least one ride in San Francisco from 2015 to the present” and “proof that any driver classified as an independent contractor meets all three criteria set by the California Supreme Court,” according to a press release from the city’s attorney The probe follows a May 1 ruling— Dynamex Operations West v Superior Court —in which the California Supreme Court sided with delivery drivers who had been misclassified as “independent contractors” rather than full employees, and thereby deprived of the benefits and legal protections that conveys. Uber and Lyft drivers are similarly classified as contracts. The companies have long argued they’re merely a platform that connects drivers to passengers rather than a traditional employer. While the US Supreme Court ruled last week against workers’ right to class action suits—thereby undermining one of the few options for redress for gig economy workers—this new probe has the potential to result in higher pay and benefits for rideshare drivers without the need for individual drivers to be mired in years-long cases that often award very little.

Monica Chin,"I am a lifelong economy flier. I am all too familiar with the common man's grind of air travel: 20 minutes standing in line, trudging through crowded aisles, hoisting heavy bags into tiny compartments, and squeezing past grumpy people into hard, narrow seats. Recently, however, I got a chance to see how the other half flies — in Qatar Airways ' Qsuite, the first ever business-class suite to include doors and a double bed. It's an experience reviewers have called the best business-class seat in the world, from the airline Skytrax has named as the world's best business-class airline. It comes at a price: A business class flight from JFK to Doha on Qatar Airways could cost as much as $7,000. SEE ALSO: Qatar Airways Flight Escorted to Manchester Airport After 'Hoax Bomb Threat' The Qsuite made its U.S. debut in December in aircrafts at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, and Qatar Airways is now in the process of rolling it out nationwide. I received a tour of one of the newly outfitted aircrafts, and a brief mock ""flight"" while it was grounded. The Suite The business-class cabin was outfitted in soothing, but futuristic colors: grey, red, burgundy, in various hues. Qatar Airways Vice President for the Americas Günter Saurwein told me that the cabin's designers aimed to combine modern western influences with a more traditional middle-eastern style. The lights faded between colors like a slowed-down disco ball, red to orange to purple, dark blue, lime green, and back again. At times, the cabin's aura was reminiscent of a dimly lit, classy restaurant. A single Qsuite under red lighting Image: monica chin/mashable Two Qsuites combine into one with a double bed. Image: monica chin/mashable The airline claims the Qsuite is the first business-class suite to feature a double bed. That's technically true, but it's slightly misleading. Each Qsuite has a total of of one seat, which can be folded down into a twin bed. The suites located in the middle of the cabin (as opposed to beside the window) are placed next to each other, and walls between them can be pulled down to create one large suite. The two twin beds, side by side, create a double bed, with a slight gap and two sets of bedding. So you'd need to buy two Qsuites to have a double bed to yourself — but it's a good option for couples. Qsuites are arranged in a 1-2-1 formation, so every passenger has direct aisle access. Image: monica chin/mashable Being a solo traveler, I opted for a twin suite beside a window. I entered through a door the height of my shoulder, which I could open and close with ease. The seat was quite comfortable, and a control panel next to it featured about a million buttons to customize settings from incline and height to lumbar support. I left it alone to start. Awaiting me in my suite were a soft blanket, several decorative pillows, pajamas from The White Company, over-ear headphones, and a toiletry kit from Bric's with higher-quality toiletries and earplugs than I've ever owned. (I never actually put on the pajamas during the flight, but I've worn them since, and they're quite comfortable.) Beside the seat were an Ottoman-style storage unit and a hook for my jacket. I was ready to ""fly."" The Flight Once we were settled in, the cocktails came out. Qatar Airways serves — and I don't say this lightly — the best drink I have ever had in my life. It's a non-alcoholic mixture of mint, sugar, and lime juice, and I am positive it's served in heaven. I had three over the course of the flight. Armed with red lighting, a Qsuite, and a delicious drink, I was ready to fly. Image: monica chin/mashable Next came the food. Everything on the menu looked delicious, and I felt the agony of indecision beginning to descend upon me. That was for naught, however: It turned out I would be served everything. The meal had three courses, along with a la carte snacks. The food was delicious, and by far the best part of the flight. In keeping with the fusion theme, the Qsuite's menu blends middle-eastern staples with Western fare. The first course of our meal included delicious bread, and biryani, and a tablecloth. Image: monica chin/mashable We received artisan breads with hummus, a chicken biryani with fried onions and toasted nuts, a wild mushroom ravioli, and a fluffy chocolate cake with figs. We also got a large snack platter including beef sliders, mini chili con carne tacos, and mini strawberry cheesecake cupcakes. I ate everything, and have no regrets — it was delicious. Wine was served throughout, and a friendly flight attendant asked if I needed anything every 15-20 minutes. Yeah, the bathroom is nice. Image: monica chin/mashable The bathroom was shiny with marble-looking countertops, and included hand soaps and sanitizers that were unlabeled, but smelled ravishing. It was a far cry from the cramped, pungent quarters that are a staple of economy cabins. The most disappointing part of the flight was the entertainment. The TV itself was much larger than one you'd see on an economy flight, and it featured games, movies, music, and TV shows, but all in limited quantities. I occupied myself by watching the one available episode of Cooks vs. Cons, in very high quality, several times over. Hey, it was a good episode. Image: monica chin/mashable Finally, I fiddled with my seat's control panel until it eventually folded all the way back. I spread out my bedding, put on the absurdly soft sleep mask I'd been provided, and lay down. Sleeping on the Qsuite's seat wasn't quite like sleeping on a mattress, but it was close enough. While atop the makeshift bed, listening to the low murmur of voices, the tap of utensils, clinking of glass, and cordial laughs of the flight attendants waiting on customers hand and foot, I couldn't help but consider the absurdity of it all. The fact that the same aircraft can serve as both an annoyance to be endured for some (like me) and a chance for others to be pampered beyond belief. The fact that to those able to shell out many thousands on transportation, such an experience may not be a luxury, but rather a continuation of a status quo unimaginable for most. The fact that those people and I fly through the same sky, in the same groundbreaking hunks of metal. That said, if I win the lottery tomorrow, am I flying in the Qsuite forever more? You bet your ass.","I am a lifelong economy flier.

Megan Rose Dickey,"In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees. This, of course, has been an ongoing conversation within the gig economy.
Those who work as 1099 contractors can set their own schedules, and decide when, where and how much they want to work. For employers, bringing on 1099 contractors means they can avoid paying taxes, overtime pay, benefits and workers compensation.
As Lyft notes in the S-1, this conversation has resulted in a number of lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and more.
“The tests governing whether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive,” Lyft states in its S-1. “Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful.”
In the event Lyft is forced to reclassify its drivers, that could result in a number of new financial burdens for the company. That includes:
Expense reimbursement
A potential injunction prohibiting Lyft from continuing its current business practices
Claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment
Monetary exposure relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages, and wage and hour law requirements
Lyft goes on to note that reclassifying its drivers as W-2 workers “may require us to significantly alter our existing business models and operations.” And this is one of those risks that could very easily happen.
As Lyft points out, it’s actively involved in six class-action lawsuits pertaining to driver classification. And the company has already settled a couple of lawsuits to the sum of $27 million in 2013, and $1.95 million in 2018. Meanwhile, California is actively examining this issue in Assembly Bill 5, which would improve protections and rights for gig economy workers. That bill was introduced in light of a groundbreaking state Supreme Court decision in April.","In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees.

"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","In Celebrity Recipes, we tackle a favorite recipe from a beloved star, past or present. Celebrities! They’re just better than regular people. Not only do they have the life we all dream of, sometimes they take that downtime between movie shoots or recording sessions to become great at something else we plebes long to master. Like cooking! Honestly inspired by the revelation that Vincent Price once cooked a fish in a dishwasher many moons ago, we decided it would be fun to dive into some legendary recipes by famous types. It’s been said before that just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you necessarily should… Read more Read Price was a bit of a gourmet, after all, and had his own cookbook, where he favored different types of pie. Writer/director Nora Ephron included loads of recipes in her first novel, Heartburn (which was about her divorce from Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein), including at least three different potato dishes. Keith Richards apparently included a bangers-and-mash recipe in his autobiography, and we’ll be sure to feature the famous Elvis fried banana and peanut butter sandwich. Hey, even original One Day At A Time star and Van Halen ex Valerie Bertinelli has a cooking show nowadays. (And if you have any celeb recipes you’d like to see us cover, please feel free to suggest them in the comments!) To kick things off, we decided to go with the greatest celebrity recipe of them all: Katharine Hepburn’s brownies. This recipe was first published in The New York Times after Hepburn’s death in 2003, and has a pretty terrific story behind it. Turns out writer Heather Henderson’s father lived in the same new York neighborhood as Miss Hepburn. When Heather wanted to drop out of Bryn Mawr, her father got his famous neighbor and fellow Bryn Mawr alumna to talk her out of it, and they became if not friends, then friendly acquaintances. When Miss Hepburn suffered a fall, Mr. Henderson brought her some brownies. His charity was immediately greeted with a critique that his brownies were too floury by the famously brusque and candid star, who quickly rattled off her own brownie recipe, repeated below. We can only imagine that a force of nature like Katharine Hepburn—fond of brisk, miles-long walks in the woods, never slowing down for an instant—did not have a ton of time to mess around in the kitchen. Subsequently, her brownies are simple, no-nonsense, and can be thrown together in about 15 minutes. But like her, simple does not mean plain here, but classic: The immediacy and brevity of these brownies does nothing to deter how wonderful they are. The melting of the butter means they couldn’t be easier to stir together, and the minimal flour does indeed result in brownies that are exceptionally chewy and moist, almost fudgy. They’re a little hard to handle, but delicious—just like Kate The Great herself. We don’t favor walnuts, which Hepburn probably harvested herself from her own New England farmland, but threw in some mini-chocolate chips instead. We might be tempted to add some heavy-duty cinnamon if we weren’t afraid that she would come back from the grave and haunt us for messing with her famous recipe. Since the ingrates we live with are going to demolish anything chocolate-related, we took Miss Hepburn’s brownies to the Onion staff for a more discerning opinion. They were as big a hit at the office as they were as home. Our colleagues agreed that the brownies tasted fudgy, “velvety,” “torte-like,” “like a cross between fudge and a brownie”; one taster rightfully called them “medium rare.” Another enthused over that softness of the brownie, as “most are over-baked”; this one “tastes the way a brownie should,” a “grown-up brownie” (that our kids loved anyway). Likely the most inspired comment came from the taster who surmised that the recipe was obviously from “someone with class.” We couldn’t agree more. 1/2 cup cocoa 1 stick butter 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup flour 1 cup broken-up walnuts or pecans (and/or chocolate chips) 1 teaspoon vanilla pinch of salt Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Melt butter in saucepan with cocoa and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Mix in eggs, one at a time. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, flour, nuts, vanilla and salt, and add to the egg/chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased 8""x8"" square pan. Bake about 35 minutes, being careful not to overbake; they should be gooey. Let cool and cut into bars. This is a small batch, makes about 12.","In Celebrity Recipes, we tackle a favorite recipe from a beloved star, past or present.

Devin Coldewey,"A report from the New York City Comptroller’s office asserts that New York residents are paying hundreds of millions in extra rent linked to the effects of Airbnb. Naturally, the company bitterly rejects these findings. The report, which you can read here, is fairly straightforward. It looks at hundreds of neighborhoods and their various demographics and characteristics, along with how much their rents rose over the last ten years or so. It finds that when controlling for other variables, Airbnb contributes to a part of the rise on its own: We find that as the share of units listed on Airbnb goes up by one percentage point, rental rates in the neighborhood go up by 1.58 percent, after controlling for neighborhood level demographic and economic changes. The result is statistically significant at the 1-percent level. By the researchers’ calculations, the total cost of these increases across the city amounted to about $616 million. That came from running their numbers with Airbnb rentals set to zero instead of the actual tens of thousands of listings and seeing what rents would be in that alternative universe. The amounts of rent increases and the number of Airbnb listings are tightly and reliably correlated, the Comptroller’s office explained. They were careful to control for other factors, for instance a neighborhood becoming trendy or new housing changing the supply. The hypothesis is that Airbnb listings, contrary to the company’s assertions, do in face reduce housing supply, which has a knock-on effect on rent in remaining rentals. The increases, the report and its accompanying press release say, are concentrated in midtown and lower Manhattan, where 20 percent of the rent increases were attributed to Airbnb effects. The effect was much weaker in the outer boroughs, as you might expect, where density is lower and fewer listings are available. Airbnb, of course, calls it a pack of lies and takes the opportunity to pontificate a bit (which, to be fair, Comptroller Stringer did too): Unfortunately, this report is wrong on the facts, falsely asserting that middle class New Yorkers who share their space are responsible for the rising cost of housing in New York… Pandering to the powerful by attacking middle class families won’t do a thing to make New York more affordable. It’s time to stop the scapegoating and work with us on a solution. Its criticisms are a mix of reasonable objections and straw men. It rightly points out, for instance, that Airbnb hosts are most frequently just renting out a room a few nights a month for some extra income, which logically should improve affordability, not harm it. Then there’s the idea that Airbnb units tend to pop up in fashionable areas, which are inherently more likely to see rents increase. Some of Airbnb’s gripes are less reasonable, however. “The notion that less than 1 percent of housing stock — much of which is only occasionally shared with short-term renters — is the sole source of New York’s housing affordability challenge is simply not credible,” the company writes. That’s true — which is probably why the report say anything like that. “We never blamed the whole increase in housing costs on one factor – we quite clearly said that Airbnb was just one factor and explained that it’s 9.2% of the increase,” wrote Tyrone Stevens, the Comptroller’s press secretary, in an email to TechCrunch. Airbnb also criticizes using 2009 as the starting year for its data, saying the financial crisis changed the whole housing market. Then it cites a report showing that a one bedroom in Williamsburg cost the same in 2018 as it did in 2011. “We picked 2009 as our base year because that was the year prior to Airbnb’s presence in NYC, and it made sense to measure the full impact of the rise of Airbnb. But the choice of base year is utterly irrelevant to measuring the contribution of Airbnb to rent increases,” Stevens wrote. “And randomly picking an industry report on 1-bedroom apartments in one neighborhood over a different time period doesn’t refute a citywide analysis.” The fact that rents are leveling out lately doesn’t hold much water, either — arguably that might have occurred sooner but for Airbnb’s alleged contribution to their increases in the first place. Ultimately the difference comes down to whether or not Airbnb effectively removes housing from the market. The company swears up and down that isn’t the case, and cites user numbers to support that position.

Adam Rosenberg,"We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V. World War II setting. New cooperative mode. New approaches to progression and personalization. No more premium pass. SEE ALSO: 'Battlefield V' brings huge changes, but maybe not what you're expecting All sorts of good stuff. But there's a lot more to share from our three-hour call with DICE on Monday. Little things that would never make it as a back-of-the-box bullet point, but which still communicate so much about how this new Battlefield is different from all the past Battlefields. So here you go: 7 things you can do in Battlefield V that you couldn't before. 1. Build up your base Fortifications are a thing now! Every soldier hits the battlefield with a tool kit in hand. You can use that tool kit in set locations — especially around capture points — to build resupply stations, sandbag walls, barbed wire fences, tank deterrents, foxholes... you name it. 2. Stick with your squad Squads are elevated to a whole new level of importance in Battlefield V. You've always had the ability to respawn on squadmates, but now you can go a step further and actually see where they are and what they're doing from an over-the-shoulder perspective before you spawn back in. You know how you used to spawn in on a squadmate only to be gunned down seconds later? That should happen a whole lot less in Battlefield V. 3. Anyone can revive now, sort of Medics are still very much the go-to soldier class for players that like to heal. They can revive any downed soldier quickly, bringing them back to full health and ready to fight in no time. But medics aren't the only way to escape death. Squadmates also have the ability to revive one another, regardless of class. It'll take longer to do the revive than a proper medic, and your buddy won't come back with all their health. But it's something. Especially since.... 4. You can drag downed teammates to safety Great news for medics and helpful squadmates alike: When you see a teammate bleeding out on the ground, you can lend a hand and drag them off to a safe location before you get to work on reviving them. It's especially helpful for squadmate revives, since those take longer (unless you're a medic). But everyone should benefit from not being caught in a situation where you're gunned down immediately after being revived. 5. Squad leaders can do cool stuff if they lead well It's not new that Battlefield's squad leaders get some measure of control over their squaddies: When you're the leader, you can issue non-verbal orders that highlight a particular capture/defend point or some other objective. Battlefield V takes that leadership a step further by giving every squad leader a radio. As your squaddies follow orders and complete objectives, you earn points. Earn enough points and you can spend them, via the radio, on all sorts of bonuses: Supply drops, smoke screen barrages, heavy weapons and tanks, and even rocket strikes. 6. Stationary weapons are stationary no more Fixed weapon emplacements like anti-air or anti-tank turrets are no longer locked in one location. In Battlefield V you're able to connect them to an assortment of vehicles and drag them around, trailer-style. 7. Soldier classes can be further specialized Battlefield's four core classes — Assault, Support, Medic, and Recon — are all back in Battlefield V, but that's only where your customization begins. New archetypes allow you to tailor your preferred class for different types of battle conditions. DICE didn't go too heavily into the specifics here, but these archetypes come with skill trees that look like they offer a significant amount of control over how you progress.","We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V.

Alex Davies,"Luge looks silly. It looks easy, too: lie down on a sled, let gravity do the work, climb the podium. In reality, of course, luge is fascinatingly complex. And, as American Emily Sweeney’s brutal crash this week made clear, it's dangerous too. A good start is crucial (that’s where the gloves with little spikes on the fingertips come in). The rule of thumb says every 1/100th of a second you lose up top compounds to 1/10th of a second by the end of the run. Aerodynamics is so important, sliders practice their form in wind tunnels. Because that form includes keeping their head back, they rely on peripheral vision and memory to steer—if you can call flexing your feet and shoulders to manipulate a sled “steering.” Winning requires finding the perfect line through a dozen or so turns on a course made of ice, whose exact shape changes from one run to the next. Of course, you'd know none of this from watching luge during the Winter Olympics. That's because NBC's commentators focus more on things like the American luger who had an at-home luge track as a kid, and something called a “clean line” that apparently matters a lot. To go from idle curiosity to the active appreciation these world class athletes deserve, I need to know what to look and listen for. I need a guide, not a commentator. You wouldn't know that the ""sled"" these people ride as fast as 90 mph is actually a patch of fiberglass, barely bigger than an Olympian tuckus, atop a pair of overgrown fish hooks. Those are bowed, so most of the time, just a few inches of the sled is touching the ice. I learned that by calling Chris Wightman, a former Olympian who’s now president of the Ontario Luge Association, who told me about the challenges in commanding one of these sleds. “If you sneezed,” Wightman says, “it would go out of control.” The speed! The precision! That's the kind of thing that gives me, a know-nothing, a glimpse of what lugers love about their sport. The kind of thing that helps me become an informed spectator. It’s maddening that after watching several hours of the sport—men, women, and the ungainly doubles—and listening to the commentary, you'd still have no idea what's going on. What these talking heads should do is talk about the sport the way they would to someone who’s not an expert at all. They should find and feast on the things that convey what makes each sport special, worthy of a place in the Olympiad. There’s more than enough to fill up air time. Like the fact that biathletes train to shoot between heartbeats. Or what kind of RPMs your body has to hit to land a quadruple jump. Or that cross country skiers use wax that can either grip snow or slide over it, depending on whether they’re going up or downhill. It's not impossible. Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski do a lovely job explaining how scoring works in ice skating, with commentary on why completing a quad spin and falling is better than landing a triple. Bode Miller taught me that in slalom, some results come down to a skier’s waxing skills (which sucks, by the way). But those are the big, marquee sports, popular to the point of familiarity. My favorite thing about the Olympics is that it’s the one time you see all the really weird stuff: biathlon, speed skating, curling, the heck-why-not combination of ski jumping and cross country skiing, the lunacy of skeleton that prompted this seminal tweet from Leslie Jones. Now more than ever before, we can watch all of the weird and funky sports, thanks to the multiplication of TV channels and online streaming. I can skip the primetime broadcast and watch one bobsledding quartet after another jump into a iron tub on its way downhill. But to go from idle curiosity to the active appreciation these world class athletes deserve, I need to know what to look and listen for. I need a guide, not a commentator. If NBC is going to maintain its grip over Olympic broadcast rights, the peacock has two years to figure this out before the Tokyo games. Because I’m gonna have a lot of questions about canoe slalom.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Who doesnt love a surprise tax bill?
Most people are expecting a tax refund this year, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017, which lowered rates and doubled the standard deduction. But at least some people who always received a refund in the past will owe money when they file this year, according to the IRS. 
Though most 2018 tax filers are still expected to get refunds, the number who owe tax, and in some cases a penalty, is likely to be larger than in recent years, the agency said.
This is most likely to apply to people with complicated taxes and those who live in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, reports CBS News, and those who itemized in the past but will take the increased standard deduction this yearespecially if you didnt check your withholdingslast year. The tax law increased some tax credits and deductions while completely eliminating or capping some others, which could have caused some of the confusion.
One of the biggest questions this tax season is whether to take the standard deduction, a flat
Read more Read
The IRS notes that two-wage-earner households and employees with non-wage sources of income are also more likely to owe, as well as retirees and those with dependents if they didnt adjust their withholdings last year. Adds the IRS:
In addition, various financial transactions, especially those occurring late in the year, can often have an unexpected tax impact. Examples include year-end and holiday bonuses, stock dividends, capital gain distributions from mutual funds and stocks, bonds, real estate or other property sold at a profit. 
And as I wrote here, many people may get a smaller refund than anticipated, since they already received the tax break in their paychecks throughout 2018. Reports CBS News:
Because the tax bill lowered tax brackets by 1 percentage point to 4 percentage points, most middle-class Americans are seeing much smaller tax cuts.
The middle 20 percent of income earners or people who earn between $42,000 to $67,000 annually saw their taxes decline by $800, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Thats a benefit of about $33 per paycheck.
If you didnt pay enough throughout the year and owe the IRS money, you may also be hit with a fine, though the agency is easing up on that slightly this year because of the confusion surrounding the 2017 tax law. Youll want to file as soon as possible to minimize penalty payments.",Who doesn’t love a surprise tax bill?

JEREMY W. PETERS and SUSAN CHIRA,"I know I am a single white male from South Carolina. And I am told I should shut up, Mr. Graham said on Friday as he addressed his colleagues, plunging directly into the caldron of race, class and gender that has washed over the Kavanaugh nomination. Mr. Graham was referring to the extraordinary fusillade he directed at his Democratic colleagues a day earlier, accusing them of trying to execute a sham power grab to leave vacant the seat Judge Kavanaugh was nominated to fill. The most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics, the senator said. The speech has turned Mr. Graham into a heroic figure on the right, where he has often been seen as untrustworthy and opportunistic. Echoing what many conservatives have said about the senator in recent days, Cleta Mitchell, a former Republican state legislator and conservative activist, said the senator had sealed his place in history for reclaiming the microphone and saying what so many millions of us have been thinking. God bless him, she added. For his part, Judge Kavanaugh hurled conspiratorial accusations at Democrats, charging them with exacting revenge on behalf of the Clintons and evoking images of the country on a precipice. He flashed contempt as he turned a question about alcoholic blackouts back on Senator Amy Klobuchar, asking the Minnesota Democrat if she had experienced any herself. Anger coursed through his recital of his pedigree captain of the football team, his admission to the top law school in the country. I was No. 1 in the class, he said. No, no, Im going to talk about my high school record if youre going to sit here and mock me. He even talked of his fondness for beer. It was a striking contrast with Judge Kavanaughs more restrained and halting interview on Fox News days earlier, one that Mr. Trump had privately criticized as weak. And his display of indignation helped change the dynamic in the hearing room after a morning when Republican senators were unable to dent the credibility of his accuser, Dr. Blasey. After watching Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday, the president told friends and staff that he was pleased the judge fought back so hard, according to one person who spoke with him. Theyre destroying this guy and his family, said Mr. Trump, according to this person, who spoke anonymously to divulge private conversations.","For many conservatives, especially white men, angry responses Thursday by Judge Brett M.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. She saw me coming. I arrived at London's Heathrow Airport after an arduous trip and a woman with a kindly face was holding a sign that read: ""Ask Me About Upgrades."" How did she know that I and my girlfriend were tired and desperate for peace, quiet and, perhaps, a touch of pampering? And this Virgin Atlantic employee was so pleasant, without being gushing. Before I knew it, I'd taken her up on her two-for-one offer and we were in what Virgin calls Upper Class. If you've never ventured into this part of the plane, the seats are pods, placed at 45 degrees to the fuselage. Romantic, it isn't. Comfortable, it is. The comfort was only enhanced by the attitude of the staff. Throughout this journey from San Francisco to London and back, the Virgin staff had been uncannily wonderful. When we checked in at San Francisco, the agent volunteered to find us a better seat in Premium Economy. She even got a colleague to help. Some minutes later, the first check-in agent saw us walking through the airport, wandered over and asked whether her colleague had found us something better. She had, and this was a proactive customer service I wasn't quite used to with most airlines. Anyway, back to Upper Class. The quite stellar customer service continued. The art lay in a relaxed manner that belied a careful anticipation of a passenger's needs. Water glasses were topped up without fuss. Wine glasses were poured without needing to be topped up. Even the food, which I never imagine will be too wonderful, was remarkably good. My chicken, mushroom and potato dish was restaurant quality. Frankly, we'd been given the same level of service -- if not the same florid array of food and wine -- on the outward Premium Economy journey. What, therefore, could possibly got wrong? AND THEN THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGED. It was the word f*** that alerted me. This was followed quite closely by two f*** ing s and a b****. No, this wasn't some deranged passenger throwing a fit for perhaps medical reasons. This was a bunch of British business types getting drunk at the bar. One feature of the Virgin Atlantic experience, you see, is the Upper Class bar. There's one on every plane. It offers several stools around a semi-circular shape, there for anyone to come, sit and, oh, socialize. We happened to be sitting close to it. We soon wished that we weren't. The more these men -- it's so often men, isn't it? -- drank, the more I wished I was back in Premium Economy. It's usually quite peaceful there, perhaps because there's no bar. After a while, it all became a little much. The voices got louder, the language got even coarser, and I won't even try to describe the ignorance of the opinions on offer. No, there's nothing redeeming about the word f***ing, even if it's followed by the word Tesla. I asked a Flight Attendant whether there was anything they could do. ""I'll go and have a word,"" they said. (Yes, I'm hiding the Flight Attendant's gender, for reasons that will hopefully soon become clear.) The Flight Attendant returned. ""I've told them to quiet down. If they don't, I'll send them back to their seats."" ""Does this happen a lot?"" I asked. ""Yes, it does. All the time. And the staff all hate it,"" said the Flight Attendant. Apparently, the people who least like the bar are the people who have to police the behavior at it. ""Every time the staff ask for the bars to be removed, Richard says no,"" I was told. The Richard is Richard Branson, Virgin's founder, who clearly believes that the bar adds some sort of flavor to his brand. DEAR VIRGIN ATLANTIC, WHY DO YOU HAVE A BAR? I know that Virgin isn't alone in having a bar, but I thought I'd ask its HQ why the airline has one at all. Please, it's not as if I don't like a drink. It's just that encouraging noise and perhaps inebriation in your high-falutin' First Class seems like a strange step toward the serenity you're always seeing in ads for First Class. So, from my seat, I emailed Virgin. ""We always welcome feedback from our customers and their current opinion is that they love the bar as a social space onboard our aircraft. Customers use it for many reasons, to enjoy a pre-dinner drink, sit and dine with their friends, chat to our cabin crew or even have a business meeting,"" an airline spokeswoman told me. Yes, but why would I want to pay a lot of money to listen to someone else's business meeting? (Unless, I suppose, I was inclined towards insider trading.) Wouldn't you imagine that if a group of friends is going to have dinner at the bar, the noise level will tend to increase? And who are these people who get on a plane, desperate to talk to other passengers? It's not them, it's me, isn't it? I have the wrong attitude. I simply don't understand why listening to a group of men discussing f***ing Tesla, f***ing Steve Jobs and f***ing great beer, while throwing down seemingly copious amounts of alcohol, isn't the apogee of civilization. This was a noon flight. These men filled the bar with their raucous racket for several hours. The cabin crew tried very hard to quieten them down and they began to disperse just as one of my gaskets began to signal it was at overload levels. Yes, the fine headphones the airline gives you to watch movies were a blessing. But just think what Virgin could do with the space instead. If Branson insists that a bar is necessary, why not launch an entirely new concept? The Whisper Bar. Wouldn't that be rather alluring?",This was all Richard Branson's fault.,2018-02-24T11:34:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",I Just Flew Virgin Atlantic Upper Class and 1 Thing Made Me Want to Scream,https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/i-just-flew-virgin-atlantic-upper-class-1-thing-made-me-want-to-scream.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_697885090_2000134920009280307_346702.jpg,,Inc.com,class-1,1
Erik Sherman,"Who could mock the possibility of nuclear war in marketing and get away with it? KFC just did in a single tweet that mocked the ""bigger button"" exchange between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump. Stepping into politics can kill your brand, as many have learned. But KFC's marketing team is not your average collection of strategists, particularly when it comes to humor. From the prom chicken corsage campaign to the 11 Herbs and Spice Girls Twitter follows and literal stratospheric suspension of a chicken burger, these people have shown themselves masters of social media. And this latest tweet was a beauty. Coming from the KFC UK &amp; Ireland Twitter account, it took a couple of tweets between the two heads of state that had many people scared over the escalating tensions between two nuclear powers. But rather than directly address the exchange, the social media team changed the context to something benign. McDonald's leader Ronald just stated he has a ""burger on his desk at all times"". Will someone from his big shoed, red nosed regime inform him that I too have a burger on my desk, but mine is a box meal which is bigger and more powerful than his, and mine has gravy! #nuclearbutton -- KFC UK &amp; Ireland (@KFC_UKI) January 3, 2018 After a couple of days, the message has more than 480,000 likes, nearly 182,000 retweets, and 3,900 responses. And gravy. That is social media savvy. There's a ready Eater named KFC its #Brand of the Year. That wasn't the only clever social media marketing hit the company managed of late. A 15-second YouTube short that plays on the theme of the company hiring a non-celebrity Colonel spokesperson to save money has gained 276,000 views in the last two weeks. Back in September 2017, another video that had the Colonel character showing a split personality arguing with himself over different chicken flavors eventually received more than 10.7 million views. There are some pointers you could glean from carefully watching the KFC accounts: Always use a light self-referential touch when it comes to humor. Even the nuclear tweets were turned on KFC and McDonald's to reduce any sense of threat. Use volume. KFC keeps posting, knowing that little of its work will get the big attention. But that's fine, because the few hits more than make up for it. Make use of multiple social media networks that will let you reuse marketing content and expand your reach and increase the chances that something catch's the public's eye.

THOMAS B. EDSALL,"However often President Trump strays from his favored political strategy, he faithfully returns to it like a dog to a bone: first, polarize the American electorate along racial, cultural and economic lines, then exploit the schisms that have supplanted the class divisions that were once central to both American and European partisan politics.
On one side of the divide are those whom the political scientists Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehartdescribe in a 2016 paper as comfortable with an inexorable cultural escalator moving postindustrial societies steadily in a more progressive direction. This new direction amounts to what the authors call
an intergenerational shift toward post-materialist values, such as cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism, generating rising support for left-libertarian parties such as the Greens and other progressive movements advocating environmental protection, human rights, and gender equality.
On the other side, Norris and Inglehart write, is a counterrevolution, a
retro backlash, especially among the older generation, white men, and less educated sectors, who sense decline and actively reject the rising tide of progressive values, resent the displacement of familiar traditional norms, and provide a pool of supporters potentially vulnerable to populist appeals.
Economic distress, they argue, reinforces cultural alienation to produce fertile terrain for Trump. Fears of economic insecurity, including the individual experience of the loss of secure, well-paid blue-collar jobs, and the collective experience of living in declining communities of the left-behinds combine to make voters
more susceptible to the anti-establishment appeals of authoritarian-populist actors, offering simple slogans blaming Them for stripping prosperity, job opportunities, and public services from Us. 
The collision of these forces has produced the emergence of an American authoritarianism. In their book, Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit and Authoritarian Populism, which comes out later this week, Norris and Inglehart write that Trump has assumed leadership of this authoritarian movement,
defined as a cluster of values prioritizing collective security for the group at the expense of liberal autonomy for the individual. Authoritarian values prioritize three core components: 1) the importance of security against risks of instability and disorder (foreigners stealing our jobs, immigrants attacking our women, terrorists threatening our safety); 2) the value of group conformity to preserve conventional traditions and to guard our way of life (defending Us against threats to European values); and 3) the need for loyal obedience toward strong leaders who protect the group and its customs (I alone can fix it,"" Believe me, Are you on my team?"").
The United States and many European countries, at various points in the last decade, have reached a critical juncture, Norris and Inglehart write: The interwar generation, non-college graduates, the working class, white Europeans, the more religious, men and residents of rural communities have come to feel estranged from the silent revolution in social and moral values, left behind by cultural tides that they deeply reject. These men and women, until recently the politically and socially dominant group in Western cultures, reached
a tipping point at which their hegemonic status, power and privilege is fading. Their values make them potential supporters for parties and leaders promising to restore national sovereignty (Make America Great Again), restrict immigration and multicultural diversity (Build a Wall) and defend traditional religious and conventional moral values.
The debate over whether the rise of right-wing populism is driven by cultural anxiety, racism, ethnocentricity or economic deprivation may be somewhat artificial, Norris and Inglehart contend because
interactive processes may possibly link these factors, if structural changes in the work force and social trends in globalized markets heighten economic insecurity, and if this, in turn, stimulates a negative backlash among traditionalists toward cultural shifts. It may not be an either/or question, but one of relative emphasis with interactive effects.
In this country, the nominally class-based politics of the New Deal fractured when working class non-college whites felt abandoned by a Democratic Party that shed its pre-civil rights, segregationist southern wing and that by the 1970s had adopted a culturally and racially liberal agenda. Over the past five decades, these white voters have formed the core of the populist right. Conversely, minorities, many of whom face the same economic hardships as working class whites, if not worse, are firmly aligned with the party of social and cultural liberalism and racial equality, the Democratic Party.
The new cultural cleavage dividing Populists and Cosmopolitan Liberals, Norris and Inglehart write, is orthogonal to the classic economic class cleavage in other words, the new division cuts across and splits the old economic class solidarity.
Data from a preliminary American National Election Studies survey provided to me by Matthew DeBell, a scholar at Stanfords Institute for Research in the Social Sciences revealed the strength of this new cleavage. The survey asked 2,500 men and women to rank their feelings toward Trump on a feeling thermometer scale of zero, very cold or unfavorable, to 100, very warm or favorable.","Encouraging and exploiting division has worked for Trump, as far as his own electoral prospects are concerned.

Cory Doctorow,"A Vox/Morning Consult poll of 1884 randomly selected US registered voters found that 54% of them would favor a ""political revolution to redistribute wealth"" to the middle class from the super-rich; support for the idea came from across the political spectrum including self-identified members of the Tea Party, as well as ""independents"" and ""white evangelicals."" A redistributive revolution turned out to be popular. Fifty-four percent of registered voters said they either strongly or somewhat agreed that it might be necessary, compared with 30 percent who either strongly or somewhat disagreed. Agreement with the statement was strongest among African Americans (68-12), Hispanics (65-15), Democrats (68-17), and 18- to 29-year-olds (68-20). And support was weakest among Republicans (36-51) and seniors (38-43).

Sam Rutherford,"At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs. But among Acer’s avalanche of metal and silicon, there was one device that felt like an anchor for the company’s growth and success: the new Chromebook Spin 13. For years, Acer has made some of the best Chromebooks you could buy, and with the new 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 13, Acer is keeping the newfound flexibility found on last year’s R13, while upping the ante with a new an all new, more premium feeling design. 1 / 5 Taking a cue from the Google Pixelbook, the Chromebook Spin 13 features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of a traditional 16:9 ldisplay. Then, Acer went and replaced the big long hinge on the R13 with a more standard two-sided setup, before tacking on a new one-piece Gorilla Glass touchpad. And unlike Acer Chromebooks of old couple years ago, the Spin 13 sports a full metal chassis that should give it some added durability and a touch of class. The Chromebook Spin 13 shouldn’t be hurting on power either thanks to your choice of 8th-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 CPUs, up to 16GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage. The Spin 13 even features built-in Wacom stylus support (including an onboard hidey hold for stashing the active pen when its not in use), so you can save handwritten notes or sketches with ease. But perhaps the best thing about the Chromebook Spin 13 is that it looks like its going to cost half the price of Google’s slick, but expensive $1,000 Pixelbook. Prices are going to start at $400 for a non-2-in-1 Chromebook 13, while the the 13 Spin will command a $100 premium on top of that. And just in case you wanted something slightly bigger, Acer is also making 15-inch versions of its new Chromebook, including the new $450 Chromebook Spin 15, which Acer claims is the world’s first 15-inch Chrome OS convertible.","At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs.

Shannon Liao,"Battlefield V is getting a multiplayer battle royale mode that’s been “re-imagined for Battlefield.” Developers are promising to “bring you an experience that you haven’t had before.” For now, there are few details on what the new mode will look like, but DICE developers say more information will come soon, perhaps during the Xbox E3 briefing tomorrow. In addition to battle royale, there are several other tweaks to improve gameplay. Players will now be able to dash and fly through windows, move turrets around with more flexibility, and tanks can now break through buildings. There’s also a bigger emphasis on being able to customize your characters. In its single-player mode, Battlefield V also gets several “War Stories” where players travel to France and Norway during World War II, battling across Rotterdam, and other locations. War Stories, a feature that was first seen in Battlefield 1, is going to highlight smaller battles that haven’t gotten as much attention in history class. Royale is coming to #Battlefield V, reimagined with the core pillars of destruction, team play, and vehicles. It will be unlike anything you’ve played before, and we’ll have more to talk about later this year. Watch the EA PLAY #Battlefield V livestream: https://t.co/heygNXz18W pic.twitter.com/eza6YLRarx — #Battlefield V (@Battlefield) June 9, 2018 In the trailer, we get to see one of the War Stories, called Nordlys, which means Northern Lights in Norwegian. Nordlys highlights a story of a young woman fighting German occupation during 1943. As DICE promised earlier last month, the newest Battlefield game will have several female characters. When DICE initially announced that women would be fighting in the World War II shooter, some fans protested, citing historical “inaccuracies.” Addressing the fan backlash, DICE general manager Oskar Gabrielson said on Twitter, “Player choice and female playable characters are here to stay. We want Battlefield V to represent all those who were a part of the greatest drama in human history, and give players choice to choose and customize the characters they play with.” Battlefield V is set to begin its EA Access Trial on October 11th. A deluxe edition will be released on October 16th, and a standard edition will follow on October 19th.","Battlefield V is getting a multiplayer battle royale mode that’s been “re-imagined for Battlefield.” Developers are promising to “bring you an experience that you haven’t had before.” For now, there are few details on what the new mode will look like, but DIC…",2018-06-09T18:32:25Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Watch the trailer for Battlefield V, now with a battle royale mode",https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/9/17437822/battlefield-5-reveal-trailer-release-date-ea-e3-2018,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MhEr9rKlpxlkMbaMnTuj2bNVNv8=/0x24:1200x652/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11507329/DfRKA00UwAASPF0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-1,1
Ahiza Garcia,"""We were harassed, we were bullied and we were body-shamed for $7.25 an hour,"" said former cheerleader Ainsley Parish, who is among the five who are suing. ""The Houston Texans should not have given us a uniform if they did not want us to become an army."" The lawsuit, which was announced in a press conference on Friday, is being brought by prominent attorney Gloria Allred. ""These women all had the same dream: They all aspired to be an integral part of the Houston Texans. And they looked forward to promoting the team,"" Allred said during a press conference. ""But their dreams were shattered by the reality of their lives as Houston Texans cheerleaders."" Allred said the women were harassed, intimidated and forced to live in fear."" She said they were threatened with being fired if they spoke out. The cheerleaders were also instructed not to speak with players and weren't paid for making public appearances. One of the cheerleaders, Hannah Turnbow, was allegedly assaulted by a fan and was told to ""suck it up and act like nothing had happened,"" according to Allred. She said there are photos of the injury the cheerleader sustained. Turnbow said she and her teammates were expected to attend events where no transportation or security was provided. The five former cheerleaders, who were part of the squad as recently as the 2017 season, are filing individual lawsuits versus pursuing a class action. Last week, three different former cheerleaders filed a lawsuit against the Texans over pay and treatment. Those women are seeking class action status. The Houston Texans responded to both lawsuits with the following statement: ""We are proud of the cheerleader program and have had hundreds of women participate and enjoy their experience while making a positive impact in the local community. We are constantly evaluating our procedures and will continue to make adjustments as needed to make the program enjoyable for everyone."" Related: NFL cheerleader files complaint over 'discriminatory' measures governing conduct The former cheerleaders are the latest to allege that they were unfairly treated and paid while representing NFL teams. In March, a former New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging gender discrimination by the NFL team. In her complaint, Jacalyn Bailey Davis said female cheerleaders and male players were held to different standards of personal conduct. She also said cheerleaders were told not to interact with players, to block them on social media and to leave a restaurant or party if an NFL player was there or showed up after them. An attorney for the Saints said in a statement that the team ""denies that Ms. Davis was discriminated against because she is female."" The statement said the team's ""policies and workplace rules will withstand legal scrutiny."" Cheerleaders for the New York Jets, Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills have also sued their respective NFL teams demanding fair pay. Cheerleaders for the Buccaneers, Raiders, Bengals and Jets reached settlements with the teams. The cheerleaders for the Bills filed a class action suit against the team, the NFL and several intermediary companies. The case, which was initially brought in 2014, currently isn't moving forward because one of the companies being sued went bankrupt. The Bills were not immediately available for comment on Friday about the case.

The high-speed rail system, like the one we are building in California, is modeled after the systems that operate in Japan or China, or France or Germany or Italy.

Credit Scott Olson/Getty Images The end of 2017 in California means farewell to the incandescent light bulb. On Jan. 1, California will be the first state to effectively ban the sale of the bulbs, which were first patented by Thomas Edison in 1879. Out with the incandescents, in with the LEDs, which use 80 percent less energy. Under a deal reached in Congress during the administration of George W. Bush, California agreed to adopt more stringent standards for light bulbs two years ahead of the rest of the nation. There are still an estimated 250 million incandescent bulbs in use in California and replacing them will save $1 billion in electricity costs annually, according to estimates published by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental advocacy group. “There’s been an LED revolution — your computer, the headlight in your car, your flashlight, you name it,” said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the council. “It’s just a superior technology.” There are a few exceptions to the ban. Incandescent bulbs will still be allowed to illuminate the inside of ovens and clothes dryers. Edison’s bulb was inefficient, producing more heat than light, but it stands up much better than LEDs to high temperatures. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Romain Dillet,"Verizon (TechCrunchs parent company) just released its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2018. The company generated $34.3 billion in revenue with an adjusted EPS of $1.12 that excludes special items.
Verizons actual EPS for this quarter is 47 cents. The reason why the company had to adjust its EPS is that the company wrote down $4.6 billion in Q4 2018 for the value of its media division, Verizon Media, formerly known as Oath. The company also took a $2.1 billion charge following a voluntary redundancy program.
Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.09 and $34.44 billion in revenue. In other words, earnings per share are slightly above expectations, revenue is slightly below. Revenue is up 1 percent year over year.
Verizon shares (NYSE:VZ) are currently trading down 0.13 percent in pre-market trading compared to yesterday’s closing price of $55.07.
Growth has been strong on the mobile front in particular. The company added 1.2 million postpaid wireless subscribers during the quarter.
Verizon finished 2018 by delivering solid financial and operational performance, as evidenced by our strong wireless service revenue and earnings growth, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg wrote in the release. 2018 was a remarkable year full of 5G firsts, including being first in the world to commercially deploy 5G with our 5G Home product. As we head into 2019 and the 5G era, were beginning a period of transformational change. We are laser focused on delivering customers a best-in-class and game-changing experience on our networks.
In case Verizon’s priorities aren’t clear, Vestberg managed to say “5G” four times in just one sentence. On the media front, Verizon Media generated $2.1 billion during Q4, down 5.8 percent compared to Q4 2017.

Andrew Freedman,"Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space. However, a new study shows that you're not likely to get the flu from a passenger seated more than 1 meter, or 3.3 feet, away from you. The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, claims to be the first to rigorously test the spread of viruses — specifically influenza — that are transmitted via large droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Researchers from Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Boeing employed teams of observers in pairs, sitting every five rows down in economy class in single-aisle aircraft during 10 transcontinental flights in 2012 and 2013. These observers watched and recorded the movements of passengers during the flight using an iPad app. SEE ALSO: 3 of 4 kids who've died from flu this year weren't vaccinated, say federal doctors The study used the movement of each passenger to simulate the spread of influenza virus from a passenger seated in the mid-cabin (seat 14C, to be exact), and an infectious crew member. The researchers developed a new model of the network of contacts passengers and crew members had with one another, as well as a simulation model of disease spread, to find out how many additional people would get sick while on typical flights that last between 4 and 5 hours. The results were surprising. On average, an infectious passenger seated in the mid-cabin had the potential to infect an additional 0.7 additional people per flight. However, if an infectious crew member chose not to stay home, and did not take medication to limit their coughing, then that infectious crew member would infect an additional 4.6 passengers per flight, the study found. ""Our model simulations yield that an infected flight attendant could infect several passengers, and we quantify this. This provides additional support for the policy of preventing crew members from working when sick,"" said study lead author Vicki Stover Hertzberg, of Emory University. The study found that people sitting in window seats who did not get up to go use the restroom or check the overhead bin had far less exposure to infectious passengers than people sitting at the aisle, or people who spent time in line waiting for the restroom at the back of the cabin, for example. So, come next flu season, you might want to pick a window seat and avoid getting up. ""If they select the window seat to minimize those exposures, they also need to stay there (i.e., don’t move). When they move, they increase their exposures,"" Hertzberg said. The study has some significant limitations. It does not apply to illnesses transmitted via smaller particles known as aerosols, which include tuberculosis, measles, and other dangerous pathogens. ""These tiny particles need not fall within a meter of the infected passenger,"" Hertzberg said. ""They can stay suspended in the cabin air for long periods of time, be taken up by air recirculation systems, etc."" The study also didn't quantify the risk of getting sick from viruses located on air cabin surfaces, such as an armrest or seatbelt. And it doesn’t apply to twin-aisle, larger aircraft used on long-haul flights, or quick shuttle flights, such as from Boston to Washington, D.C. The bottom line, though, said study co-author Howard Weiss, also of Emory, is that ""If you practice good hand hygiene, keep your hands away from your face, and if you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected by influenza during an 4 to 5 hour flight.""","Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space.

Kate Clark,"SurveyMonkey, which helps businesses gather feedback through its survey platform, has submitted paperwork to the SEC for its upcoming NASDAQ public offering. The company plans to raise $100 million in the IPO, per the filing, though that’s likely a placeholder amount. The company, which will list under the symbol SVMK, has yet to price its shares. Most recently, SurveyMonkey brought in $250 million from Tiger Global, ICONIQ Capital and Social+Capital Partnership. The financing valued the company at $2 billion. SurveyMonkey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. At the ripe age of 19, San Mateo, Calif.-based SurveyMonkey has been prepping an IPO for years now, finally filing confidentially with the SEC via the JOBS Act, which lets companies test the waters before they formally release an S-1, in mid-June. Despite its age, the company still isn’t profitable. SurveyMonkey reported a net loss of $27.18 million on $121 million in revenue in the first half of 2018. During the same period last year, it had a $19 million net loss on $106.5 million in revenue. In all of 2017, SurveyMonkey posted a $24 million net loss on $219 million in revenue. The filing lists J.P. Morgan as the lead underwriter for the IPO. The online polling company has raised some $600 million across several rounds of equity funding from investors, including Tiger Global, which owns a 29.3 percent pre-IPO stake. Its board includes Serena Williams and Sheryl Sandberg. Sandberg’s late husband Dave Goldberg was the founder and former CEO of the company; he passed away in 2015. She owns 10,318,577 shares, but plans to “donate all shares beneficially owned by her (or the proceeds from the sale thereof) to the Sheryl Sandberg and Dave Goldberg Family Foundation as part of fulfilling their philanthropic commitment to the Giving Pledge,” the filing states. SurveyMonkey joins a herd of unicorns that have announced plans to transition into the public sphere this year. Eventbrite, for example, submitted its IPO paperwork last week, with plans to raise $200 million from selling Class A shares. Smartsheet, Zuora, Dropbox and DocuSign have all completed their public debuts this year.","SurveyMonkey, which helps businesses gather feedback through its survey platform, has submitted paperwork to the SEC for its upcoming NASDAQ public offering.

Kate Clark,"MasterClass, the website that brings celebrity-taught classes to the public, like tennis lessons from Serena Williams and photography instruction from Annie Leibovitz, has raised $80 million to expand internationally. The Series D funding, led by IVP, will also be used to bring more celebrities to MasterClass. The company currently offers 39 classes, with plans to hit 50 by the end of the year. In the last year, MasterClass has added a writing class with Margaret Atwood, a comedy lesson from Judd Apatow and more. Co-founder and CEO David Rogier told TechCrunch this morning that he hopes to bring Elon Musk, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and JK Rowling on board soon. MasterClass’ sales more than doubled from 2016 to 2017 and are on track to do the same this year. That puts the company on pace to match Udacity and Coursera — a pair of edtech heavyweights — in revenue, according to Rogier, who would not disclose MasterClass’ financials but made the comparison. Udacity has said publicly that it increased revenue to $70 million last year, up from $29 million in 2016. Coursera, for its part, is reportedly “within striking distance of $100 million dollars in annual revenue.” Udacity was founded in 2011 and garnered a $1 billion valuation in 2015. Coursera, founded in 2012, was valued at $800 million last year. Three-year-old MasterClass declined to disclose a valuation. To thrust itself ahead of its competitors, MasterClass also recently rolled out a new subscription model that allows customers to pay an annual fee of $180 for access to all MasterClass lessons, which are otherwise $90 each. It’s been a huge success so far, counting for 80% of the company’s revenue. On top of that, MasterClass released its first-ever mobile app this April. Before that, all the company’s growth came from desktop. “To our investors, that was a shock and a surprise,” Rogier said. “It’s really rare and amazing that you could drive that amount of growth without being on those platforms.” San Francisco-based MasterClass previously raised $54.5 million in venture capital funding. Rogier says they ultimately decided to raise again once they had the data to show how impactful their classes were for customers. “ One-fourth of our students say that taking these classes transformed their life,” he said.","MasterClass, the website that brings celebrity-taught classes to the public, like tennis lessons from Serena Williams and photography instruction from Annie Leibovitz, has raised $80 million to expand internationally.

"AP, AP","SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Chicago Cubs right-hander Yu Darvish lasted just one inning in his rehab start with Class A South Bend on Sunday, casting doubt on his availability for the rest of the year. Darvish, who has been sidelined by triceps and elbow injuries, shook his arm as he left the field after striking out Great Lakes' Romer Cuadrado with a 95-mph fastball for the last out of the first. When Darvish warmed up for the second, he threw six pitches and winced on each one. Miguel Amaya, who caught Darvish's rehab start for South Bend on June 25, walked to the mound and summoned manager Jimmy Gonzalez and a trainer. After a short discussion, Darvish walked to the dugout. Darvish, who turned 32 on Thursday, signed a $126 million, six-year contract with Chicago in February. But he has made just eight starts in his first year with the Cubs, going 1-3 with a 4.95 ERA. The Cubs began the day with an NL-best 71-51 record, but their rotation is looking a little thin. Mike Montgomery was placed on the 10-day disabled list on Friday with left shoulder inflammation, and Tyler Chatwood has struggled in his first year with Chicago after signing a $38 million, three-year contract over the winter. The Cubs were optimistic about a possible return for Darvish after he threw about 55 pitches in a simulated game on Tuesday. But that optimism was likely wiped out by Sunday's rehab appearance. Darvish allowed a first-pitch single and issued a walk to his first two batters, and then retired three in a row. He totaled 19 pitches, 10 for strikes. In his June rehab start for South Bend, Darvish allowed one run and three hits in five innings. His fastball reached 94 mph, but he complained afterward that his arm got tired as the outing went on. ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Kevin Billings,"It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall. For students, that means hearing the three words they fear the most: ""back to school."" Whether it's heading to college at the end of August or high school after labor day, education is going to be the priority again. SEE ALSO: 20 things you need to survive life in a college dorm If there is a silver lining to this time of year, it's all the back to school sales that have or are going to start in the coming weeks. Whether you need basic class supplies or have to load up for a dorm, everything you could possibly need will be on sale. That also means it's the perfect time for anyone looking to get a new laptop. The right laptop is essential. Luckily, finding a good laptop on sale at this time of year is not a difficult task. Here are some of the best deals right now: The best thing about Chromebooks are their simplicity. These are computers designed for some light web surfing and getting work done and not much more than that. The Samsung XE500C13-S03US is the perfect example of that simple and reliable design. It sports 2GB of RAM with a 16GB SSD, which doesn't sound like a lot, but makes it perfect for school work. And with an 11-hour battery life, you'll be ready to go for those long class days and study sessions. If you need something that might be a little bit faster, then the HP Chromebook 11 G5 could be the laptop for you. On the whole, the HP Chromebook isn't much different from the Samsung Chromebook mentioned above, both sporting the Celeron processor and a 16GB SSD for storage. However, you do get 4GB of RAM with this model from HP, which will provide a nice boost in performance for anyone who needs a little extra oomph out the Chromebook. While regular Chromebooks are always useful, sometimes there's a need for a little more flexibility. To that end, the ASUS Chromebook Flip provides that flexibility with a 2-in-1 design. At a technical level, it's on par with the previously mentioned Chromebooks with 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage for reliable performance. But, as the name implies, the screen can flip for anyone who may need a tablet in a pinch. That sort of flexibility can be a welcome addition, especially in the classroom. As reliable as Chromebooks can be, some classes and school needs may demand more out of your computer. Thankfully, there are laptops that can provide that power without breaking the bank, and Lenovo provides that with the 320-15. Under the hood, the Lenovo sports 6GB of RAM for faster performance and a 1TB HDD, so it doesn't skimp on storage. That extra space is especially useful for those semesters where it seems like you have a paper due every week. Dell is one of the biggest in the game. Because of that, there are certainly plenty of choices available under the Dell banner. And for the average student looking for an above average computer, the Inspiron 15 is the laptop to check out. The Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 is perfect for anyone who needs a killer laptop/tablet combination. And with 8GB of RAM and, again, a 1TB HDD, it delivers flexible power on a budget. This is the alternative to the 2-in-1 mentioned above, more suited for anyone looking for a more traditional laptop out of the Dell Inspiron 15. At a technical level, it's nearly identical as the aforementioned Dell 2-in-1. However, while the 2-in-1 sports the IntelR Core i3, this one has the AMD Ryzen 5, which has emerged as a viable alternative to the Intel line of processors that have dominated the market. And given AMD's background in the games space, the Ryzen processor reflects that with an extra bump in power. If you like the Chromebook, but wish it had a little extra power behind it, Google has just the thing to scratch that itch in the Pixelbook. The Pixelbook offers the flexibility of the basic Chromebooks with specs on par with laptops similar to the aforementioned Dell computers. For example, it uses the Chrome OS and sports an Intel Core i5 processor, highlighting the balance between simplicity and power the Pixelbook offers. And with a 2-in-1 design, it's yet another laptop bolstered by some excellent physical flexibility. All that makes for a laptop that, if you're going into your freshman year at college, will provide longevity. Those are just a few of the laptops you can on sale right now. As the start of the year gets closer and closer, more deals will hit and more laptops will be available at excellent prices. Just keep you're ear to the ground and your browsers locked to Amazon, Walmart, and others for more deals.","It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall.

San Francisco State has a highly diverse student body, and Ardila, who just turned 40, is a prominent voice in the mathematics community about how to make students from underrepresented groups— such as women and people of color—feel that they belong. But on this occasion, as he looked around at his students’ demoralized faces, he knew he had missed the mark. “Nadie te quita lo bailado,” Ardila told his students. “I think that’s a very powerful message—that nobody can take away from you the joy that you’ve had doing mathematics,” he told Quanta Magazine in an interview last month. “And people can give you grades, but that’s not going to take away the freedom that you felt and the fulfillment that you felt.” The expression also applies to Ardila’s research, though not always in ways he would have chosen. Four years ago in Portland, Oregon, a thief smashed his car window and made off with a backpack containing, as luck would have it, five years’ worth of work—all of Ardila’s notes from a sweeping new paper he was developing. Proofs, examples, counterexamples and conjectures were all gone. But the thief couldn’t steal the mathematics Ardila had “danced” in his mind. Over the past few years, Ardila and his coauthor, Marcelo Aguiar of Cornell University, have painstakingly reconstructed their work unifying the geometric and algebraic sides of combinatorics—the study of discrete structures like a social network, a sudoku puzzle, or a phylogenetic tree. They finally posted their 113-page paper online in September, and in January Ardila will be presenting their work in an invited address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the biggest annual math conference in the United States. Quanta spoke with Ardila at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, where he is visiting for the fall semester, about the mathematics he has danced and taught. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Your mathematical talent was identified quite early—in fourth grade, you got the highest score in your age group in a national math competition in Colombia. It was actually my sister, Natalia, who first showed great promise in mathematics. I was just the little brother. She and my cousin Ana María, they both performed really, really well in this national math competition. And I think the organizers probably said, “OK, these two women are very good, and then here’s the little brother who’s coming along to the awards ceremony. Maybe he’s OK also.” I feel like from a young age, they were paying attention to me. I never enjoyed mathematics in school very much, but my experience through the Math Olympics was much more creative and much more playful. Federico Ardila as a child in Colombia with his mother, Amparo, and his sister, Natalia. And it turned out that it was, as many of these spaces are, a very male-dominated space, and eventually both my sister and my cousin felt uncomfortable with this space. I mean, they’re doing amazing things now; my cousin is an engineer and my sister is a music pedagogy professor. But I do think it’s kind of interesting—that was a space where I felt very comfortable and that felt very nurturing to me, and it didn’t feel so to other people. It was a space that was very “othering” for them. I think that’s always served to remind me of the role of a mathematician, of an educator, in curating the culture of a place. That’s why that’s been such a theme in my work. You’ve said that you were surprised to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where you did your undergraduate and doctoral studies. What’s the story there? I had never heard of MIT. And it hadn’t crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and apply. At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not like being told, “Read this” or “Think this way.” I just kind of wanted to do things on my own terms. I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have applied with that kind of transcript. I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that we’re not eligible or that we’re not good enough. And especially if you’re somebody who feels “othered” in your discipline or who feels like you’re lacking confidence, it’s easy to close doors on yourself. There’s a lot of people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you can’t do it for yourself. When you came to the United States, as an undergraduate at MIT, it was your turn to feel like the “other.” It’s not that anybody did anything to mistreat me or to doubt me or to explicitly make me feel unwelcome, but I definitely felt very different. I mean, my mathematical education was outstanding and I had fantastic access to professors and really interesting material, but I only realized in retrospect that I was extremely isolated. There’s a system in place that makes certain people comfortable and others uncomfortable, I think just by the nature of who’s in the space. And I say that without wanting to point fingers, because I think you can be critical about the spaces that “other” you, but you also have to be critical about the ways in which you “other” other people. I think because mathematics sees itself as very objective, we think we can just say, “Well, logically, this seems to make sense that we’re doing everything correctly.” I think sometimes we’re a little bit oblivious as to what is the culture of a place, or who feels welcome, or what are we doing to make them feel welcome? So when I try to create mathematical spaces, I try to be very mindful of letting people be their full human selves. And I hope that will give people more access to tools and opportunities. What are some of the ways you do that in your teaching? In a classroom I’m the professor, and so in some sense I’m the culture keeper. And one thing that I try to do—and it’s a little bit scary and it’s not easy—is to really try to shift the power dynamic and make sure that students feel like equally powerful contributors to the place. I try to create spaces where we’re kind of together constructing a mathematical reality. So, for example, I taught a combinatorics class, and in every single class every single student did something active and communicated their mathematical ideas to somebody else. The structure of the class was such that they couldn’t just sit there and be passive. I believe in the power of music, and so I got each one of them to play a song for the rest for us at the beginning of each class. At the beginning it felt like this wild experiment where I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I was really moved by their responses. Some of them would dedicate the song to their mom and talk about how whenever they’re studying math, they’re very aware that their mom worked incredibly hard to give them the opportunity to be the first ones in their family to go to college. Another student played this song in Arabic called “Freedom.” And she was talking about how in this day and age it’s very difficult for her to feel at home and welcome and free in this country, and how mathematics for her is a place where nobody can take her freedom away. That classroom felt like no other classroom that I’ve ever taught in. It was a very human experience, and it was one of the richest math classrooms that I’ve had. I think one worries when you do that, “Are you covering enough mathematics?” But when students are engaged so actively and when you really listen to their ideas, then magic happens that you couldn’t have done by preparing a class and just delivering it. Mathematics has this stereotype of being an emotionless subject, but you describe it in very emotional terms—for instance, in course curricula you promise your students a “joyful” experience. I think doing mathematics is tremendously emotional, and I think that anybody who does mathematics knows this. I just don’t think that we have the emotional awareness or vocabulary to talk about this as a community. But you walk around this building and people are making these discoveries, and there are so many emotions going on—a lot of frustration and a lot of joy. I think one thing that happens is we don’t acknowledge this as a culture—because mathematics is emotional in sometimes very difficult ways. It can really make you feel very bad about yourself sometimes. You can be pushing on something for six months and then have it collapse, and that hurts. I don’t think we talk about that hurt enough. And the joy of discovering something after six months of working on it is really deep. Your own research is in combinatorics. And the paper you’ll be presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings connects two different ways of understanding combinatorial structures, through the lenses of geometry and algebra. How do those two approaches work? When you look at the geometric side of things, suppose, for example, you want to study the permutations (the ways of rearranging a collection of objects). It’s pretty well known that if you have n objects, the number of ways of putting them in a row is n factorial (the product n ( n -1)( n -2)…1). So it’s not a very interesting problem to count how many ways there are. But what is their inherent structure? The three-dimensional permutahedron, a geometric depiction of the ways to rearrange the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Two permutations are connected by an edge if one can be transformed into the other by swapping two consecutive numbers. If you look at when two permutations are related to each other by just swapping two elements, then you start understanding not only how many there are but how are they related to each other. And then, when you say, “OK, let’s take all the permutations, and put an edge between two of them if they’re a swap away,” then you find that you get this beautiful shape that’s a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides). I think it’s completely surprising initially that the inherent relations between permutations are captured in this beautiful polytope called a permutahedron. So all of a sudden you have this geometric model, and you can use tools from polytope theory to try to say new things about permutations. And that polytope has existed for a long time and is very well understood. And then you can also think of permutations algebraically—there’s a natural sort of “multiplication” on permutations, in which the product of two permutations is the permutation you get by doing one permutation after the other. This is one of the most important objects in algebra, this group of permutations. There are these two traditions, to take combinatorial objects and either make them geometric or make them algebraic. This project with Marcelo Aguiar was about trying to bring together these two points of view, and in fact we discovered that polytopes like the permutahedra have an additional related algebraic structure. I think we found a really beautiful connection between the geometric and the algebraic structure of combinatorial objects. We got a dozen results just from building this architecture and then reaping the benefits. For many, though by no means all, mathematicians, teaching takes a back seat to research. But for you, it seems that teaching and research are very much intertwined. You often give your students open-ended problems, and you’ve co-authored many papers with students. I love working with students. And I love sharing the joy of discovery with them. Most of my students are master’s and undergrad students, because San Francisco State doesn’t have a PhD program. I think that has steered my research to things that are more immediately accessible. But still, I need the questions to be very deep. I’m very excited about my research. I think I’m doing the most interesting research of my life right now. People tell you at 40 you start declining, and I feel like I’m getting good now. Federico Ardila DJing at the 2017 Life Is Living Festival in Oakland. Almost a decade ago you founded a DJ collective based in Oakland. How does that tie into your work as a mathematician and teacher? When I DJ I’m really looking for joy, and I’m looking to create an atmosphere where people can build bridges and connect. My professor side comes out a little bit, because I play a lot of stuff that people don’t know, and I try to play music from many places that they haven’t thought about. I also see music as a tool for social change. Some of the events I do are social benefits—it’s about music, but it’s also about feeding the soul and getting ready for the change that you want to make in the world. It feels very similar to the kind of atmosphere that I try to create in a classroom. I see all of these things as being connected.

Jon Russell,"Here’s something I didn’t expect to read today. The U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed Snap for details on its IPO apparently in connection with a lawsuit from disgruntled shareholders who claim the company played down its rivalry with Instagram. Reuters first reported on the subpoenas which Snap has confirmed. Precise details aren’t clear at this point but Snap told Reuters that the probe is likely “ related to the previously disclosed allegations asserted in the class action about our IPO disclosures.” Snap went public last March with sharing popping over 40 percent on its debut to give it a valuation of $30 billion. It’s market cap today is a more modest $8.9 billion due to numerous factors including, most prominently, the efforts of rival Facebook to compete with Instagram, which has rolled out a series of features that mimic Snap’s core user experience. That cloning has taken its toll on Snap’s business. Today, Instagram’s Stories — the feature that closely resembles Snap’s app — has some 400 million users, that’s more than double the users of Snap. But it is far-fetched to claim that Snap played down that threat when it went public, which is what the class action case claims. The writing had been on the wall for some time as Snap noted in its S-1 filing ahead of the IPO: We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally. This includes larger, more established companies such as Apple, Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Google (including YouTube), Twitter, Kakao, LINE, Naver (including Snow), and Tencent, which provide their users with a variety of products, services, content, and online advertising offerings, and smaller companies that offer products and services that may compete with specific Snapchat features. For example, Instagram, a subsidiary of Facebook, recently introduced a stories feature that largely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive. We may also lose users to small companies that offer products and services that compete with specific Snapchat features because of the low cost for our users to switch to a different product or service. Moreover, in emerging international markets, where mobile devices often lack large storage capabilities, we may compete with other applications for the limited space available on a users mobile device. We also face competition from traditional and online media businesses for advertising budgets. We compete broadly with the social media offerings of Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and with other, largely regional, social media platforms that have strong positions in particular countries. But even if an investor something didn’t read that document or reports of it (not advised) there was ample press coverage of the growth of Instagram Stories, and Facebook’s general Snap cloning efforts, since its launch in August 2016. In particular, TechCrunch covered the rivalry and cloning closely ahead of Snap’s IPO with reports that showed Instagram was “stealing” Snap users, that it was responsible for slowing user growth and more. In short, it was fairly clear that Instagram was cloning Snap, which in turn was a key factor for Snap’s growth struggles. Don’t get me wrong there’s certainly a lot to worry about over at Snap — those poor user numbers, a string of executive exits and a strange u-turn on a recent hire — but this lawsuit looks to be little more than sour grapes from investors who either didn’t fully understand the space they invested in, or simply made a poor decision to back Snap at whatever price they did. On that note: anyone who invested at Snap’s peak valuation might have lost more money than betting on Bitcoin during this year’s January hype — that’s saying something — but ultimately they have no-one to blame but themselves.",Here’s something I didn’t expect to read today.

At 32, he is at the peak of a career that has taken him to stardom at Spurs and Real Madrid. He is also Croatia’s top passer, and the team rises and falls on his performance. Denmark vs. Croatia Top Story Lines • Croatia has advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup for the second time in its history. The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark’s first visit to the last 16 since 2002. • Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland. • With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game. • One of Denmark’s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, “What I can say about Eriksen is, he’s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He’s the most important player for Denmark.” The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension. • These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Denmark won theat game, with Peter Schemichel, father of current keeper Kasper Schmeichel, in goal. • Croatia is a comfortable favorite to win, with Denmark 4-1 or so.

"Nick Leggin on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","My family heads to Wisconsin every year for my dad and stepmothers Saturday-after-Thanksgiving dinner. Most of their stepchildren are between families Thursday and Friday, so the Saturday event gets a high turnout. The foods pretty good too, so that may be another reason. Like REO Speedwagon at a casino auditorium, this dinner plays the hits: turkey, gravy, marshmallow-topped sweet potatoes, two kinds of stuffing, and a phalanx of dinner rolls. Occasionally a Jell-O salad or vegetable will make a cameo. For me, the star attraction is the unique spin on mashed potatoes. To be sure: I love potatoes in all forms. Theyre easily my favorite food. Mashed, baked, roasted, chips, refried after mashingbring them all to my plate in endless quantities, thank you. Even to a potato-lover, these mashed potatoes still belong in a class to themselves. They are not a Wisconsin delicacy (Im not aware of other families that do what my stepmom does) but I cannot imagine a recipe like this emanating from another state in the union. What makes these different from standard turkey-day potatoes? Imagine a twice-baked potato without the shell. There are four varieties of dairy in the dish: cream cheese, sour cream, butter, and sharp cheddar cheese (amazingly, no milk!). Theres a generous amount of bacon. When baked, the potatoes get a crispy, caramelized outer crust. This is a departure from traditional mashed potatoes, and I understand any skepticism. But I contest that the dish embodies many traits of a great Thanksgiving side. These potatoes taste awesome with turkey, as well as with gravy, which offers a savory counterbalance to their cheesy tang. Theyre not ruined when the errant cranberry makes their way into the potato pile on your plate. For the leftover fiends among us, they hold up well to reheating the following day. This recipe requires strength. One must have Lincoln Hawk -like forearms to fold in all the ingredients prior to baking. It yields a gallon of potatoes. My stepmom doubles the recipe (two gallons!), which is enough to serve two dozen people and allows for plenty of leftovers. At our Thanksgiving, the double batch of potatoes are served in a container the size of a porch planter. These potatoes also take patience. If youre making these the day ahead, plan for at least 90 minutes of oven time for reheating. Separating into smaller dishes will speed up this process. If you say Thanksgiving in Wisconsin, nothing is probably more on-the-nose than a cheese-heavy side dish. Few things draw my ire like lazy mockery of Wisconsinites and their love of dairy. When it comes to this dish, Ill set the ire aside, and take another scoop of potatoes. 5 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled 10 oz. bacon, sliced into small strips 8 oz. cream cheese 1 1/2 sticks of butter 1 cup sour cream 2 chives, chopped very fine 2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 2 tsp. kosher salt 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper Slice the bacon into 1/4-inch strips, and cook until slightly brown. Drain fat and set aside. Peel the potatoes and cut into quarters. Boil until tender, then drain. Using a ricer, mash potatoes into a thin layer back in a very large mixing bowl. Place about a third of the butter and cream cheese on top of the layer. Alternate layers of riced potatoes with the butter and cream cheese. Use the sturdiest wooden spoon you have to incorporate the cup of sour cream. Then fold in the in the cheddar cheese, bacon, and chives. Grimace occasionally while your hand cramps, then get right back to it. Grease a large, oven-safe pot; I use a 7.5 quart Dutch oven. Pour the potatoes into the cooking vessel. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. About 30 minutes in, check to see if the sides started browning. You can scrape down the sides with a wooden spoon and stir the brown bits into the mix, to avoid burning and introduce more deliciousness. Bake for 30 more minutes.","My family heads to Wisconsin every year for my dad and stepmother’s Saturday-after-Thanksgiving dinner.

We Are The Mighty,"A US sailor watches Spanish Alvaro de Bazan-class frigate ESPS Cristobal Colon sail with Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Laboon (DDG 58), March 11, 2018. US Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kallysta Castillo Let's face it: The littoral combat ship has not exactly lived up to all of the hype. In fact, it has proven to be inadequate in replacing the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided-missile frigates. Now, the United States Navy has started the FFG(X) program to find the next guided-missile frigate, and five shipbuilders are contending. One such shipbuilder is General Dynamics, which intends to iterate on the Spanish Alvaro de Bazan-class guided-missile frigate. This class of frigate has been around for a while — the lead ship was commissioned by the Spanish Navy in 2002. The vessel weighs 5,800 tons and carries a five-inch gun, a 48-cell Mk 41 vertical-launch system, two twin 324mm torpedo tubes, a 20m Meroka close-in weapon system, and, for good measure, an H-60 helicopter. The Bazan also has the SPY-1 radar and the Aegis Combat System. In this sense, it's like a miniature Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer. The Spanish F 100 class frigate Almirante Juan de Borbon (F 102) in the Pacific Ocean during Combat Systems Ship Qualifications Trails at the Pacific Missile Test Center Range off the coast of California. US Navy As the Bazan-class was entering service, the United States Navy had begun to look at replacing the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided-missile frigates. The Perry-class frigates had been initially equipped with a Mk 13 missile launcher that could carry up to 40 missiles (usually a mix of RIM-66 Standard SM-1MR missiles and RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles), a single 76mm gun, two triple 324mm torpedo tube mounts, and a Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system. The littoral combat ship has seen a number of problems. The big issue has been breakdowns that leave the ships stuck pierside. Well, one didn't break down, it got iced in — but the problem persists nonetheless. The other problem is that the littoral combat ships usually enter the fight with just a single 57mm gun, a few.50-caliber machine guns, and a launcher for the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile. The Navy is planning to buy 20 of these new frigates, with the announcement and order of the first ship to be made in 2020. Whether the Bazan makes the cut remains to be seen.","US Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kallysta Castillo Let's face it: The littoral combat ship has not exactly lived up to all of the hype.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren Qatar Airways will feature its award-winning new ""Qsuites"" business class on flights from Chicago starting on April 1. The airline also announced plans to roll out Qsuites on flights from Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The airline currently flies from 10 US cities — plus Las Vegas, later this year — and operates an extensive network throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with connections through Doha, Qatar. Qatar Airways just announced that its new ""Qsuite"" business class product, which was first announced last year, will soon be available on the airline's daily flight from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The airline also announced that it would be replacing the equipment on its flights from Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles later this year. Qsuites will be available on Chicago flights starting on April 1. Qatar hasn't announced timing or other details for Houston, Dallas, or Los Angeles. While rumors have been circulating that Qatar planned to launch Qsuites from Chicago for several weeks, since travel blog One Mile At A Time noticed that the available seat maps on Chicago flights had changed, this is the first time the airline has confirmed the service's Midwest expansion. Qatar Airways won awards in 2017 for best airline and best overall business class from Skytrax, the authoritative airline review and ranking consultancy group. While its older business class product is still comfortable and features fantastic service, Qsuites is a redefinition of business class as ""first class lite."" The new product, which features fully enclosed ""suites"" in the air with seats that can fold into flat beds, and even combine into double-beds in the middle aisle, should be rolled out through Qatar's entire fleet of long-haul aircraft within two years, according to Qatar Airways vice president for the Americas Gunter Saurwein. Until then, it will be launched on one route at a time. Currently, Qatar's New York City and Washington, DC routes feature aircraft equipped with Qsuites. There are 10 US cities that are currently serviced by Qatar Airways : Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. It's also announced plans to launch a route to Las Vegas later this year. Because Qatar is a member of the Oneworld airline alliance, you can book connecting flights on Oneworld partner American Airlines, or non-alliance codeshare partner JetBlue, as part of the same itinerary. Qatar offers routes to around 150 destinations, with connections through its airport hub in Doha, Qatar. Routes throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Africa are all compelling for US-based travelers. I recently had a chance to tour a Qatar Airways 777-300ER plane while it was parked at New York's JFK airport in between trips. I was able to test the seats and the in-flight entertainment, explore the business class and economy cabins, and sample the business class catering and amenities, as well as interact with the cabin crew that would be working on the flight later that evening. While this was a staged media event, which is obviously different than actually flying the airline, it became clear why Qatar won Skytrax's 2017 top honors.

MIKE TIERNEY,"As for Meyer, himself, he departs with a somewhat complicated legacy, with great achievements on the field tarnished to a degree by things that occurred away from it.
He won three national titles one with Ohio State and two with the University of Florida and his winning percentage of .853 is unmatched among active coaches. Yet the school suspended him three games this season, concluding he mishandled the issue of an assistant coach accused of domestic abuse. And at his previous stop, in Florida, there were a considerable number of players involved in off-field misconduct.
So while there is no denying his genius as a coach, to his critics, at least, the reports that he would start his retirement by helping instruct a business class at Ohio State on leadership and character seemed like satire. In fact, he will be doing just that.
Meanwhile, against Washington on Tuesday, Meyers Buckeyes (13-1) corrected this seasons main deficiency yielding long gains on the ground. Coming into the game, Ohio State had allowed six rushing touchdowns of more than 75 yards, the most by any Football Bowl Subdivision defense since 2003.
The Huskies (10-4), however, scrounged out just 3.6 yards per carry, with their lengthiest running play covering 19 yards. They resorted to a tailback pass by Myles Gaskin in the fourth quarter to finally put a touchdown on the scoreboard.","The coach, who served a suspension earlier this season, had already announced his retirement, but he coached his team to a win over Washington in his final game.",2019-01-02T03:20:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Ohio State 28, Washington 23 | Rose Bowl: As His Parting Gift, Urban Meyer Gives Ohio State a Rose Bowl Victory",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/sports/urban-meyer-ohio-state-rose-bowl.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/sports/02rosebowl-web1/02rosebowl-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1
Tom Simonite,"When China’s government said last summer it intends to surpass the US and lead the world in artificial intelligence by 2030, skeptics pointed to a major problem. Despite gobs of data from the world’s largest online population, lightweight privacy rules, and 8 million fresh college graduates in 2017, the country doesn’t have enough people skilled in AI to overtake America. This week Kai-Fu Lee, onetime head of Google’s operations in China, launched a new project to help close the country’s AI talent gap. His helpers include the Chinese government and some of North America’s leading computer scientists. The project is an example of how US and Chinese efforts to progress in AI are entangled, despite recent rhetoric about superpower technology rivalry. Lee was born in Taiwan, studied in the US, and began his career in AI research before stints as an executive at Silicon Graphics, Apple, and Microsoft. He led Google’s expansion in China until 2009, when he left to found an AI-centric investment firm now called Sinovation Ventures. The firm invests in both China and the US, and has its own AI research institute. At Peking University in Beijing Tuesday, Lee addressed 100 professors from Chinese science and engineering schools. Over the next four months the group will learn how to teach machine learning and other AI techniques, in a new annual program supported by Sinovation’s AI Institute, the University of Peking, and China’s Ministry of Education. Some of the newly trained professors will help with a second phase of the program this summer, in which 300 top students will get special training in AI from Lee and other experts. Cornell professor John Hopcroft, second from left, lectured at the opening day of a new AI training program backed by China's government at Peking University. Despite the program’s connection to China’s government, some of the experts helping Lee work for American institutions. Cornell Professor John Hopcroft joined Lee to teach on opening day this week. He received the Turing Award, considered the Nobel of computing in 1986, and now does research on machine learning. Google’s leading AI researcher Geoff Hinton is slated to give a class via videolink this summer. In his four-hour lecture Tuesday, Hopcroft summarized for the assembled professors the contents of a machine learning course at a top US university. He’s made frequent trips to China over the past decade trying to help the country improve the quality of its university education, which he describes as a humanitarian project. “The opportunity in China is to make the world better for millions of people,” he says. Lee says his program will quickly expand the nation’s supply of programmers with AI experience. “If these professors each teach a class of 400 students in fall and spring, that would graduate thousands of students for employment in 2019,” he says. That could help Chinese companies competing to hire AI engineers—including startups in Lee’s investment portfolio. It also aligns with a key strand of China’s Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan announced last July. The plan envisions China’s economy, military, and society invigorated and empowered by artificial intelligence. The government is seeking to build on a recent surge in AI investments from China’s internet companies and others, which has created several startups worth over $1 billion in areas including facial recognition and new types of computer chips. Government support for AI in China includes new funding, government contracts, and access to some state data troves. Growing China’s AI talent base has also become a major theme, with the government supporting new programs from colleges and companies. Given that background, and recent friction between the US and China over technology and trade, Sinovation’s project might add fuel to concerns in Washington about an “ AI arms race ” between the countries. The US Trade Representative’s report justifying this week’s sanctions on $50 billion of Chinese imports said that one part of China’s AI plan is to use venture investments and other engagements with the US to draw technology back home. One hundred college professors from around China joined the program to improve how they teach AI skills to their students. Lee calls that framing “narrow minded.” He says companies and academics in both China and the US openly publish AI research papers and software. Google opened an AI research lab in China in December, saying it wants to collaborate more with the Chinese AI community. “This is not a weapons race, AI is more an enabler,” says Lee. That argument is somewhat shared by some in Washington. Bob Work, previously deputy secretary of defense in both the Obama and Trump administrations, chairs a new task force on AI at think tank the Center for a New American Security. At the launch event last month, he pushed back on use of the term “arms race” and said America’s greatest priority should be backing commercial development of AI. Elsa Kania, a researcher on the CNAS task force, says that could include taking pointers from Sinovation’s government-sponsored program in Beijing. “I would argue the United States should be doing the same,” she says. In 2016, the Obama White House produced a pair of reports on the potential of artificial intelligence that recommended investment in AI education and research. Nvidia, Intel, and several academics made similar pleas at congressional hearings on AI in February and March. So far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in the technology. Getting Smarter Despite protests from some American officials, it's too late to stop China from becoming a power in artificial intelligence. The victory by an artificial-intelligence program from Chinese tech giant Tencent over a Go champion shows the country's gains in AI. As part of a national strategy, China is challenging Nvidia's dominance in chips used for artificial intelligence.","Kai-Fu Lee, head of the investment firm Sinovation Ventures, is training Chinese professors to teach artificial-intelligence techniques.",2018-04-05T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Ex-Google Executive Opens a School for AI, With China's Help",https://www.wired.com/story/ex-google-executive-opens-a-school-for-ai-with-chinas-help/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac53fb24ef2b00b5a181596/191:100/pass/KaiFuLee-836071602.jpg,wired,Wired,class-1,1
Josh Constine,"Coinbase has some serious competition. Today Robinhood starts rolling out its no-commission cryptocurrency trading feature in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire. Users can buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum with no extra fees, and track those and 14 other coins in its sleek app. That’s compared to paying 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US on Coinbase. Users can sign up on the Robinhood Crypto site to waitlist for access. Robinhood has a chance to usurp Coinbase as the defacto crypto trading site app by vastly undercutting its fees. When people are buying thousands of dollars of cryptocurrencies at a time, Coinbase’s 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US can quickly add up. But Robinhood sees giving away the service for free as a powerful way to gain users for its existing service that lets people trade stocks, ETFs, and options without additional charges. It’s stylish, retro-future Tron interface is also a super easy way to check on pricing and news about 16 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Stellar, Qtum, Bitcoin Gold, OmiseGo, NEO, Lisk, and Dogecoin. Robinhood Crypto first announced the feature last month, with one million people signing up in just the first four days. That interest has driven Robinhood’s total registered user count to over 4 million, up from 3 million in November. Those users have transacted over $100 billion to date, saving $1 billion in commission fees. On most stock trading services like E*Trade and Scottrade, customers pay around $7 per trade to cover these companies’ marketing, physical branches, and sales reps. Founded in 2013, Robinhood ditches those fees by running a lean operation centered around engineers and its app. It makes money on the interest of cash its customers keep with it, or by selling monthly Robinhood Gold subscriptions that let users borrow money to trade with. That business has allowed the startup to raise $176 million, most recently at a $1.3 billion valuation. And with its free crypto trading, it may have found a way to luring in a fresh class of amateur investors. Keeping security locked tight will be critical, especially given disastrous breaches at other crypto companies.

Ron Miller,"Whenever you are doing something online that requires you to present an official ID like a passport or driver’s license to complete the transaction, it presents risk to both parties. Consumers want to know they are secure and brands want to know the person is using valid credentials. That’s where Veriff comes in. Kaarel Kotkas, CEO and founder of the company, says the goal is to be “the Stripe of identity.” What he means is he wants to provide developers with the ability to embed identity verification into any application or website, as easily as you can use Stripe to add payments. The company, which was originally launched in Estonia in 2015, is a recent graduate of the Y Combinator winter class. When you undertake any activity on the web or a mobile app that requires a valid ID, if Veriff is running under the hood, you can submit an ID such as a driver’s license. It uses a secret sauce to determine that the ID being presented is an officially issued one and that it belongs to the person in question. When you consider that there were over 15 million identity thefts in the US in 2016 alone, you know it’s not a simple matter to identify a forgery. Fake IDs can be quite good and it’s often difficult to identify fraudulent ones with the naked eye. It’s hard to tell the difference between the real and fake IDs in this shot. Photo: Veriff If you want to open a bank account online for instance, you have to provide proof of identity for the bank. With Veriff, you take a picture of yourself, then submit a picture of your official ID and Veriff analyzes it to make sure it’s valid. The idea is to make the ID process easy and quick for the consumer, while providing an accurate way for the brand to check IDs online.

Jaime Green,"The start of a new year is, of course, the perfect time for a fresh start. There’s the metaphorical power, plus the numerical ease of counting days and months of success from Jan 1. But balanced against the celebratory excess and indulgence of the holiday season, New Year’s resolutions can, sadly, tend towards abstinence. This year I’ll stop smoking. This year I’ll lose weight. This year I’ll quit Diet Coke. This year I’ll be the better, purer, stronger version of myself. Better and stronger is awesome, but here’s a proposition: get there without having to tell yourself “no.” (All you aspiring smoking-quitters, hang tight, this can work for even you, too.) Deprivation is nasty stuff. It’s woven into the Puritan work ethic that’s woven into so much of American culture—the idea that abstinence is virtue, that willpower is spiritual strength. Sure, there are bad things in life, and it’s best to stay away from them, but an ethic of deprivation is a slippery slope to a life of empty asceticism. I’m on the fence about New Year’s resolutions. I understand the appeal—new year, new me—but I also… Read more Read Deprivation is also often a recipe for nasty relapses. Willpower, to the extent that it exists, is a finite resource. When you assign yourself a new zone of self-control, unless you’re doing work to replenish your mental energy, you will run out of “strength.” Think of a rubber band pulled and pulled until it snaps. That snap is your slip, and the tighter you’ve pulled yourself, the more it’s going to hurt. (If you’ve ever gone on a restrictive diet and, after hours or weeks, found yourself bingeing in a way you never would’ve before the diet, you know this feeling well.) Okay, so: how can you achieve your goals without telling yourself “no”? Most of the time, it’s a simple flip: Stop eating junk food. → Eat more vegetables. Lose weight. → Do Couch to 5k or Go to yoga class once a week. Stop overcommitting socially. → Reserve one night a week to stay in. Quit Diet Coke → Drink more water. Stop looking at Twitter in bed. → Read a book for ten minutes before bed every night. (Or: Start using Freedom.) They’re not one-to-one matches—you can eat junk food and vegetables, and running won’t necessarily make you lose weight. But these positively framed resolutions get at the core value you’re trying to develop in yourself by focusing on adding a new habit instead of subtracting an old one, whether it’s fitness, peacefulness, or hydration. The most frustrating thing about a phone addiction is that unlike actual substance abuse, the… Read more Read Even if your resolution is truly, at its heart, about stopping a bad behavior, it’s hugely useful to couple stopping the bad thing with the addition of a new, positive habit—a yes in addition to the no. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself at your 3pm smoke break just looking around with nothing to do and an awful craving. It’s easier to replace a habit than to erase one. Think about where, when, and how your old habit happened, and be prepared with a replacement—a thing you will do to replace the thing you won’t. Remember that resolutions of any kind take energy to turn into long-lasting and secure patterns. Be gentle with yourself, and you’ll be able to do great things.","The start of a new year is, of course, the perfect time for a fresh start.

Emily Price,"During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does. At some point during the conversation, it came out that I had never had a true Irish coffee. Seconds later they made sure I had one in my hand and I was hooked. In the United States, an “Irish Coffee” can mean anything from a cup of coffee with a shot of whiskey in it to the real deal, but more often than not it falls somewhere in between. A traditional Irish coffee will typically be served in a small glass cup identical to the one in the photo above. It’s most often made with Jameson and sweetened coffee, and topped with chilled double cream (liquid cream, not whipped cream from a can) which can be tricky to get just right. I spent the past week in Ireland and my Irish Coffee dojo Martin demoed how to make the magic happen at one of the bars we stopped in at. You can check out my video of the demo below: Video: E.Price Given that I shot it in a crowded bar in not the most ideal way, I’ve also included a demo from Jameson proper which is a little different than what Martin showed me but is a little different. My written directions below are what I was taught and I think lead to a more authentic and tastier coffee, but you do you and adjust as needed. How to do it You want to start by warming your class up by pouring in hot water. If you’re using one of those fancy coffee glasses like I have above, you want to put a spoon inside the cup when you do this so you don’t break it. After you dump the water, fill the glass roughly 2/3 of the way full of coffee and then add some sugar. Jameson says to use 2 parts Demerara sugar and 1 part Muscovado sugar, Martin just used three spoonfuls of brown sugar. Yes, it’s a lot of sugar, but you need that amount not only to get the flavor right but also to ensure that your cream will float. Once you add the sugar give it a serious stir and make sure all of it dissolves, then add your whiskey. For a glass the size above, I used a shot of whiskey and a little extra for “good luck.” If you’re using a larger glass, by all means use more whiskey. Give the coffee another stir and then you’re ready for your cream. This was the most interesting detail for me. At home when I’ve tried to do this before I pour the cream in and it sinks to the bottom. Not what you want. That can happen when you don’t have enough sugar, but it’s also an issue if you screw up the pouring. For that, you want to rest your spoon right on the top of the coffee in your glass, so close that the bottom of the spoon is getting wet, but there isn’t any coffee inside the spoon. Then you slowly pour the cream into the spoon, allowing it to disperse across the top of your drink. The Jameson video above spoons a heavier cream over the top which also works, but doesn’t look as good in my opinion. If you want to go suuuuper easy you can also use canned whipped cream, but that’s pretty far from authentic and definitely not as tasty. If you have your spoon in the wrong spot, which is easy to do, then you just end up with cream throughout your glass. It’s still delicious, but definitely not as pretty. If you’re looking for a delicious treat this St. Patrick’s Day I definitely recommend giving an Irish coffee a try. You’ll thank me later.","During a trip to Dublin a few years ago I befriended a group of older Irish women at a bar one afternoon, as one does.

"ANUPAM B. JENA, MICHAEL BARNETT and TIMOTHY J. LAYTON","These arbitrary entry-age cutoffs have important implications for the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, we found that among several hundred thousand children who were born between 2007 and 2009 and followed until 2016, rates of A.D.H.D. diagnosis and treatment were 34 percent higher among children born in August than among children born in September in states with a Sept. 1 school entry-age cutoff. No such difference was found among children in states with different cutoff dates. The effects were largest among boys. We believe these findings reveal just how subjective the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. can be. In any given class, inattentive behavior among younger, August-born children may be perceived, in some instances, to reflect symptoms of A.D.H.D., rather than the relative immaturity that is biologically determined and to be expected among children who are nearly one year younger than September-born classmates. The stakes of additional, potentially inappropriate diagnoses are high, particularly when diagnoses are accompanied by medical treatment, which has side effects. In cases where A.D.H.D. is appropriately diagnosed, we know that behavioral and medical treatments can improve concentration, school performance and other outcomes. And in these instances, the harms of medical treatments are, on average, outweighed by the benefits. But when the disease is improperly diagnosed, the clinical harms and dollar costs of treatment may not be met with commensurate benefits. Unlike other diseases such as asthma and diabetes, whose diagnosis is more objective and is not based on peer-to-peer comparisons, the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. appears heavily influenced by how children behave in school relative to peers and how those differences in behavior are interpreted by school personnel, parents and ultimately, physicians. Indeed, some evidence suggests that teachers and other school personnel are more likely than physicians or parents to first suggest that a child may have A.D.H.D. Our findings arent new, but they suggest a continuing problem. Several older studies, both within and outside the United States, analyze rates of A.D.H.D. diagnosis among children born just before versus just after school entry-age cutoffs, similar in design to our study. Nearly all of these studies suggest that younger children within a grade are more likely to be diagnosed with A.D.H.D. than older children in the same grade. One study found that the relative age of a child in a class strongly affects teachers assessments of whether a child demonstrates A.D.H.D. symptoms but does not affect parents assessments, which suggests that many diagnoses may stem from teachers perceptions of students that are based on a childs age relative to peers.","Posters about feelings, learning and empathy in a second-grade class in Minneapolis.",2018-11-28T22:12:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Link Between August Birthdays and A.D.H.D.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/opinion/august-birthdays-adhd.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/28/opinion/28ANUPAM/28ANUPAM-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Dianne Grossman Image caption Mallory had faced months of cyber-bullying from her classmates The parents of a 12-year-old girl in the US state of New Jersey who took her own life are suing the school district, saying it failed to prevent bullying. Dianne and Seth Grossman say the school ignored repeated complaints that their daughter was being targeted. According to the lawsuit, Mallory was sent text and Snapchat messages calling her a ""loser"", making fun of her looks, and prompting her to end her life. The Rockaway Township school district declined to comment on the legal action. Filed on Tuesday, nearly a year after Mallory's death on 14 June 2017, the lawsuit accuses Copeland Middle School of failing to take significant action to prevent bullying. It alleges that the school's response was to force Mallory to hug one of her alleged bullies, in lieu of disciplinary action, and accuses the school district of discouraging her parents from making a formal complaint. Image copyright Dianne Grossman/Facebook Image caption Mallory's mother Dianne said the school dismissed her concerns Administrators also suggested she avoid her harassers by eating in an office instead of the lunchroom, the lawsuit alleges. The school district issued a statement in August of last year saying ""the allegation that the Rockaway Township School District ignored the Grossman family and failed to address bullying in general, is categorically false"". The statement also said that school officials had been directed not to comment further on the case. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, the Grossmans' attorney, Bruce Nagel, said complaints to the school had been ""terribly ignored"" and called smart phones ""a lethal weapon in the hands of the wrong child"". ""We are hopeful that the filing of this lawsuit will bring national awareness to the epidemic of cyber-bullying and that we do not have to attend any more funerals of students who have been the victims,"" Mr Nagel said. Mrs Grossman told News 12 she wanted the school to ""care less about test scores and care about the emotional intelligence"" of children. ""Instead of removing Mallory from choir class,"" she said, ""I wanted the girls that were tapping her chair every other day and calling her a [expletive] - I wanted those children removed from class. Not Mallory."" The lawsuit is the first cyber-bullying suicide case filed in New Jersey. The families of the group of girls accused of bullying Mallory have been notified that they could face legal action, Mr Nagel said. School personnel and the township as a whole were also named in the lawsuit for failing to ensure children's safety in a local school. In a letter posted on the school's website in April, the town's board of education said school superintendent Greg McGann, who is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, would be ""commencing a leave of absence"" through 30 June 2018.

AISHA HARRIS,"He’s candid to a fault, a trait that clashes deliciously with his tendency to condescend to everyone around him, especially his teammates. “I look down at people with love,” he reveals, matter-of-factly. DeMarcus is like the student who is constantly disrupting the class to say something wildly inappropriate, and is admonished by the teacher — who is simultaneously trying to stifle a laugh. You can’t help but be drawn to him. The show’s creators, Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, and its showrunner, Dan Lagana, use the character to interrogate a crossroads of social issues: class, race, the corrosive nature of the sports industrial complex within academic institutions. In one clever subplot, the wannabe-detectives Sam and Peter turn to DeMarcus’s texts to try to suss out his guilt or innocence; as they compare his language to that of the Turd Burglar’s cryptic messages on social media, the subject turns to the matters of code switching. DeMarcus unashamedly shifts his slang when around his mostly white classmates at St. Bernardine versus his friends back home in Rainier Beach, a less affluent and less white town 40 minutes away. “It is what it is,” one of those “city friends,” as Peter describes them, tells the filmmakers resignedly. “We all gotta do it.” This flippant response is emblematic of how “American Vandal” presents these issues — instead of signposting the complicated, often icky politics that typically underscore the narrative of a black athlete at a predominantly white school in real life, they are seamlessly embedded in the storytelling. Sometimes they are brought right to the surface, as with the code switching comment, but more often it’s subtle. In a later episode, DeMarcus reveals that underneath his happy-go-lucky exterior is a teenager who finds his success “alienating.” Mr. Gregg plays this moment of self-reflection just as confidently as he does DeMarcus’s boastful swagger. He pinpoints the pressures of being an athlete, but one can also infer that his blackness plays a part in it, too. “All of those people, they might act like they love me, and sometimes I feel like they do,” he tells Peter and Sam, as images of DeMarcus interacting with his mostly white classmates, appear on the screen. “It just don’t feel real. It don’t feel genuine.” The character of DeMarcus does feel real, and genuine. Not unlike Dylan Maxwell (Jimmy Tatro), the dimwitted prankster at the center of Season 1’s mystery, or “American Vandal” itself, he ultimately turns out to contain a bit more substance than initially meets the eye. That’s what elevates him above a one-dimensional, one-trick source of comic relief — DeMarcus is absurd, but grounded; conceited, thanks to his singular abilities, yet just as desperate for authentic human connection as the rest of us.","DeMarcus (Melvin Gregg), a prime suspect in the true crime satire, has the ego of Kobe Bryant and the goofball charm of the Fresh Prince.

In all, there are seven returning exotics that we know of. SEE ALSO: 'Destiny 2' gets Warmind and a major update this week. Here's the deal. Because I'm a monster, I decided to rank them.

All of which is to say: Please enjoy my 100 percent scientific, completely official, and impossible to argue ranking of Warmind 's returning Destiny exotics.

It's the only weapon in this lineup, for one. But more than that: It's freaking Suros Regime. One of the best weapons in the original game.

Suros gets the bottom-rung nod mostly because it's the only weapon here, and it's always fun to start these dumb lists with a curveball. Or hey, let's say it's because the gun is blue now. Sure. That works. Suros is blue and that's bad. 6. Claws of Ahamkara Image: bungie As we've already discussed, Warlocks are trash. They're better in Destiny 2, sure, but their jump still sucks. The Claws of Ahamkara are a Warlock exotic, so instant demerit there. They also come with a fairly useless ability, which is a real problem for a class of gear that's supposed to make you feel powerful. Equip the Claws and you can charge up to two melee attacks instead of the usual one. It's the height of meh. Let's also not overlook the physical makeup of this thing you've willingly chosen to equip. It's basically a bunch of golden feathers protruding from your wrist, with all of them held in place by what appears to be a snap-on leather BDSM restraint. It's... different! But it's not going to up your Destiny 2 game. Sorry Claws of Ahamkara, you lose. 5. Apotheosis Veil Image: bungie Oh hey, look at that. Another Warlock exotic. Woopity scoop. Apotheosis Veil is somehow less useful than Claws of Ahamkara. It's got an exotic perk fully heals you and recharges your melee/grenade attacks whenever you activate your super. That's... nice. You really shouldn't be popping your super when you're at low health, though. Not unless you're wearing Apotheosis Veil, I guess. But why would you? There are better options. Looks alone give this one the edge over Claws of Ahamkara. What the hell is going on in there? Can our Warlock friend breathe? Is there some kind of cool space gas in there that activates your so-so exotic perk? Apotheosis Veil gives good screenshot, but little more than that. 4. Sealed Ahamkara Grasps Image: bungie Visually, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are a step up from the Claws' BDSM feathers. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these Hunter gauntlets. It's like someone polished and shaped a pile of fossils and glued it onto a sci-fi gauntlet. These rank higher than the Claws of Ahamkara largely because Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are not a Warlock exotic. The perk is also just provably better: You still get to charge up to two melee attacks, but you also have a chance of automatically reloading your weapon whenever you deal melee damage. It's almost as if Destiny itself is out to troll Warlocks. 3. Eternal Warrior Image: Bungie Eternal Warrior has one edge here over all the other exotics: It looks the coolest. It's a helmet that has its own face. What more do you need to know? It's also useful! Assuming it works the way its predecessor did, Titans get added damage resistance whenever their Fist of Havoc super is active. Eternal Warrior also makes Fist of Havoc last even longer. Most of all: It's not Warlock gear. Huge bonus for this (or any other) helmet. 2. Armamentarium Image: Bungie Armamentarium is what the Punisher would wear if he existed in the Destiny universe. Look at this thing. Those rows of bullets. The two breast grenades. A pair of Liefeld-ian pouches. This is an exotic for the Titan that is ready to go to war. It also happens to come with one of the most useful exotic perks in the game: Two grenades. It may not be as flashy as some of the others, but being able to store up as many as two grenade charges is never not useful in Destiny, especially for Titans, one of the most powerful grenade classes in the game. There are always things worth chucking grenades at in Destiny 2. 1. Fr0st-EE5 Image: bungie The Hunter is Destiny 2 's forgotten class, and that's a real shame for me, self-professed Hunter 4 Lyfe. But with the Fr0st-EE5 (pronounced ""frosteez"") coming back, that's all going to change. See all the tubes coming out of the boots in the image above? Those things charge up with power when you're sprinting around. That power then feeds into your abilities, speeding up your melee and grenade regeneration while you're running (you can also turn faster). Hey, you know what's terrible in Destiny 2 ? The recharge time on melee attacks and grenades. Bring on the Fr0st-EE5, baby. To lightly paraphrase what a wise Star Wars man once said: They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts. You can buy Destiny 2 here.","There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news.

Beth Skwarecki,"Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain. But AIs aren’t all run by mega-corporations and governments; you can download some algorithms and play with them yourself, with often hilarious results. There’s the faux Coachella poster full of fake band names, created by feeding a bunch of real band names into a neural network and asking it to come up with some of its own. There are the recipes created in a similar way, where “barbecue beef” calls for “1 beer - cut into cubes.” And then there’s my favorite, Janelle Shane’s AI-generated paint colors (tag yourself, I’m Dorkwood). Humans aren’t nearly as creative as we think. Craft brewers, for example, have run out of fun names … Read more Read These were all made with neural networks, a type of AI modeled on the network-like nature of our own brains. You train a neural network by giving it input: recipes, for example. The network strengthens some of the connections between its neurons (imitation brain cells) more than others as it learns. The idea is that it’s figuring out the rules of how the input works: which letters tend to follow others, for example. Once the network is trained, you can ask it to generate its own output, or to give it a partial input and ask it to fill in the rest. But the computer doesn’t actually understand the rules of, say, making recipes. It knows that beer can be an ingredient, and that things can be cut into cubes, but nobody has ever told it that beer is not one of those things. The outputs that look almost right, but misunderstand some fundamental rule, are often the most hilarious. I was happy to just watch these antics from afar, until Shane mentioned on Twitter that a middle school coding class had generated better ice cream names than she had. And I thought, if kids can do this, I can do this. How to Train Your First Neural Net I started with the same toolkit Shane used for ice cream flavors: a python module called textgenrnn, by Max Woolf of Buzzfeed. You’ll need a basic knowledge of the command line to work with it, but it works on any system (Mac, Linux, Windows) where you’ve installed the programming language/interpreter python. Before you can train your own neural net, you’ll need some input to start with. The middle school class started with a list of thousands of ice cream flavors, for example. Whatever you choose, you’ll want at least a few hundred examples; thousands would be better. Maybe you’d like to download all your tweets, and ask the network to generate you some new tweets. Or check out Wikipedia’s list of lists of lists for ideas. Whatever you choose, get it into a text file with one item per line. This may take some creative copy-and-paste or spreadsheet work, or if you’re an old hand at coding, you can write some ugly perl scripts to munge the data into submission. I’m an ugly perl script kind of girl, but when I ended up wanting Lifehacker headlines for one of my data sets, I just asked our analytics team for a big list of headlines and they emailed me exactly what I needed. Asking nicely is an underrated coding skill. (If you’d like to feed Lifehacker headlines into your own neural net, here is that list. It’s about 10,000 of them.) Create a folder for your new project, and write two scripts. First, one called train.py: from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn() t.train_from_file(‘input.txt’, num_epochs=5); This script will get the neural net reading your input and thinking about what its rules must be. The script has a couple things you can modify: t = textgenrnn() is fine the first time you run the script, but if you’d like to come back to it later, enter the name of the.hdf5 file that magically appeared in the folder when you ran it. In that case, the line should look like this: t=textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5’) ‘input.txt’ is the name of your file with one headline/recipe/tweet/etc per line. num_epochs is how many times you’d like to process the file. The neural network gets better the longer you let it study, so start with 2 or 5 to see how long that takes, and then go up from there. It takes a while to train the network. If you’re running your scripts on a laptop, one epoch might take 10 or 15 minutes (bigger data sets will take longer). If you have access to a beefy desktop, maybe your or a friend’s gaming computer, things will go faster. If you’ve got a big data set, you may want to ask it for a few dozen or even hundreds of epochs, and let it run overnight. Next, write another script called spit_out_stuff.py (you’re free to give these better names than I did): from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5') t.generate(20, temperature=0.5) This is the fun part! The script above will give you 20 fun new things to look at. The important parts of that last line are: The number of things to generate: here, 20. The temperature, which is like a creativity dial. At 0.1, you’ll get very basic output that’s probably even more boring than what you fed in. At 1.0, the output will get so creative that often what comes out isn’t even real words. You can go higher than 1.0, if you dare. When you ran the training script, you’ll have noticed that it shows you sample output at different temperatures, so you can use that to guide how many epochs you run, and what temperature you’d like to use to generate your final output. Not every idea your neural network comes up with will be comedy gold. You’ll have to pick out the best ones yourself. Here are some of the better Lifehacker headlines that my AI came up with: The Best Way to Make a Baby Laptop How to Survive a Backspace Drinking Game The Best Way to Buy a Job Interview How to Get the Best Bonfire of Your Life With This Handy Graphic How to Make Your Own Podcast Bar How to Get a New iPhone X If You’re an Arduino How to Clean Up Your Own Measurements in a Museum How to Get Started With Your Stories and Anxiety The Best Way to Make Your Own Ink Out of the Winter How to Keep Your Relationship With an Imaginary Concept The Best Way to Make a Perfect Cup of Wine With a Raspberry Pi The Best Way to Eat a Toilet Strawberry How to Get a Better Job on Your Vacation The Best Way to Eat a Stubborn Jar I got these by playing with the temperature and the number of training epochs, and every time I saw something I liked I copied it into a text file of my favorites. I also experimented with the word-by-word version of the algorithm; the scripts above use the default character-by-character model. My final list of headlines includes results from both. If you’re curious about some of the rejects, here’s what I get with a 0.1 temperature: The Best Way to Stay Streaming to Stop More Alternative to Make Your Phone The Best Way to Stream the Best Power When You Don’t Need to Know About the World The Best Way to Stay Started to Stay Started to Your Common Ways to Stop Anyone How to Get the Best Way to See the Best Popular Posts The Best Way to Stay Started to Make Your Phone And if I crank it up to 1.5 (dangerously creative): Remains of the Day: How to Ad-Finger the Unsubual Renew Qakeuage to Travel History, Ovenchime, or “Contreiting Passfled The Risk-Idelecady’t Two-Copyns, Focusing Zoomitas Ifo Went Vape Texts Battery Oro crediblacy Supremee Buldsweoapotties DIY Grilling Can Now Edt My Hises Uniti to Spread Your Words Clearly, human help is needed. Become Your AI’s Buddy Even though neural nets can learn from data sets, they don’t truly understand what’s going on. That’s why some of the best results come from partnerships between people and machines. “I know it is a tool that I use,” says Janelle Shane, “but it is hard not to think of it as—‘come on little neural network, you can do it’ and ‘Oh, that was clever’ or ‘You’re getting confused, poor little thing.’ To make the most of your relationship, you’ll have to guide your AI buddy. Sometimes it might get so good at guessing the rules of your data set that it just recreates the same things you fed it—the AI version of plagiarism. You’ll have to check that its funny output is truly original. Botnik studios pairs people with machines by training predictive-text keyboards. Imagine if you picked up your friend’s phone, and typed messages by just using the predictive text on their keyboard. You’d end up writing your own message, but in a style that reads like your friend’s. In the same way, you can train a Botnik keyboard with any data source you’d like, and then write with the words supplied by the keyboard. That’s where this amazing advice column duel came from: two Botnik keyboards trained on Savage Love and Dear Abby. If you’d prefer to work against, rather than with, your algorithmic buddy, check out how Janelle Shane pranked a neural net that at first appeared to be good at recognizing sheep grazing in a meadow. She photoshopped out the sheep, and realized the AI was just looking for white blobs in grass. If she colored the sheep orange, the AI thought they were flowers. So she asked her Twitter followers for sheep in unusual places and found that the AI thinks a sheep in a car must be a dog, goats in a tree must be birds, and a sheep in a kitchen must be a cat. Serious AIs can have similar problems, and playing with algorithms for fun can help us understand why they’re so error-prone. For example, one early skin-cancer-detecting AI accidentally learned the wrong rules for telling the difference between cancerous and benign skin lesions. When a doctor finds a large lesion, they often photograph it next to a ruler to show the size. The AI accidentally taught itself that it’s easy to spot cancerous tumors: just look for rulers. Another lesson we can learn is that an algorithm’s output is only as good as the data you feed in. ProPublica found that one algorithm used in sentencing was harsher on black defendants than white ones. It didn’t consider race as a factor, but its input led it to believe, incorrectly, that the crimes and backgrounds common to black defendants were stronger predictors of repeat offenses than the crimes and backgrounds associated with white defendants. This computer had no idea of the concept of race, but if your input data reflects a bias, the computer can end up perpetuating that bias. It’s best that we understand this limitation of algorithms, and not assume that because they aren’t human they must be impartial. (Good luck with your hate speech AI, Facebook!) Mix Up Your Data Sets There’s no need to stop at one data set; you can mix up two of them and see what results. (I combined the product listings from the Goop and Infowars stores, for example. Slightly NSFW.) You can also train a classifying algorithm. Shane says she already had a list of metal bands and a list of My Little Pony names, so she trained a classifier to tell the difference. (Pinky Doom: 99 percent metal.) Once you have a classifier trained, you can feed anything into it and get a reading. Benedict Cumberbatch: 96 percent metal. You can also feed anything you like into a trained textgenrnn network. When you specify how many items you want and what temperature (creativity) the network should use, you can also give it a prefix. It will then try to come up with words that should follow that prefix. After I trained the Lifehacker headlines, I asked the AI to give me headlines beginning with “3 Ingredient Happy Hour.” It responded with some wonderful fictional cocktails (again, these are my picks out of a longer list): 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Herb Stressful Upgrade 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Cake’s Strawbreak 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Darkled Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Pizza and Beverage For They Are Trader Wings 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Ferrent Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Throat Into a Refreshing 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Bar Order 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Leftover Party Controci 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Summer Rum Cutting 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Coconati 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Beautiful Shicline 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Cheekey Candy Don’t be surprised if you see these in a future Lifehacker post; Claire Lower, our food and beverage editor, says she wants to attempt making some of these. But instead of waiting for her expert recipes, I decided to feed these into a neural network as well. I gathered some cocktail recipes from Chris Lowder’s cocktail guide and the WikiBooks cocktails glossary, and arranged them so that each cocktail took up one line of a text file, with the title of the cocktail as the first few words. That means I could choose a cocktail name and ask my cocktail-trained neural net to provide the recipe that follows. Here are a few of the results: The Best Coconati - oz. Benedictine e. 1 dash Aromatic b. &lt;1 oz. Cranberry d..5 oz. Lemon c..75 oz. Iteloun d. 2 dashes Juponged Slipes i. Stir/Strain/Coupe/No garnish The Cheekey Candy i. 1 oz. Blendey Sherry b. 1.5 oz.

Egg White in large rocks glass with dets 1934 or makes Babbino﻿ The Lifehacker c. 14 Vodka Martini i..75 oz. Campari i. Shake/Fine strain/Coupe/Lemon twist The input data was only a few hundred cocktail recipes, so I had to turn the temperature way up to get anything interesting. And at a high temperature (1.0, in this case), sometimes you get words that aren’t really words. Good luck finding any Lonstine Brandy or Blendey Sherry in a store—but if you do, my pet AI will be very happy.","Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain.

Richard V. Reeves,"Focusing on the top 1 percent is a mistake. The real class divide is between the upper middle class and the rest of America.
In January 2015, Barack Obama suffered an acute political embarrassment. A proposal from the budget he’d sent to Congress was dead on arrival—but it was the president himself who killed it.
The idea was sensible, simple, and progressive. Remove the tax benefits from 529 college saving plans, which disproportionately help affluent families, and use the money to help fund a broader, fairer system of tax credits. It was, in policy terms, a no-brainer. You can easily see how the professorial president would have proposed it. But he had underestimated the wrath of the American upper middle class.
As the 2016 election helped us see, the real class divide is between the upper middle class and everyone else.
As soon as the administration unveiled the plan, Democrats started to quietly mobilize against it. Representative Chris Van Hollen from Maryland (now a senator) called his colleague, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi happened to be traveling with Obama from India to Saudi Arabia on Air Force One. As they flew across the Arabian Sea, she persuaded the president to drop the reform. The next day, White House spokesman Eric Schultz declared that the 529 plan had become “a distraction” from the president’s ambitious plans to reform college financing.
The episode was a brutal reminder that sensible policy is not always easy politics, particularly when almost every person writing about, analyzing, or commenting on a proposal is a beneficiary of the current system. Pelosi and Van Hollen both represent liberal, affluent, well-educated districts. Almost half of their constituents are in households with six-figure incomes. I should know: Van Hollen was my congressman at the time. My neighbors and I are the very people saving into our 529 plans. More than 90 percent of the tax advantage goes to families with incomes in the top quarter of the distribution.
As Paul Waldman noted in the Washington Post, the proposal “was targeted at what may be the single most dangerous constituency to anger: the upper middle class—wealthy enough to have influence, and numerous enough to be a significant voting bloc.” Like the flash of an X-ray, the controversy revealed the most important fracture in American society: the one between the upper middle class, broadly defined as the top fifth of society, and the rest.
The triumph of Donald Trump also exposed some dangerous fault lines in America’s class structure. It is a mistake to attribute the result of the November 2016 election to a single cause. Years of work lie ahead for social and political scientists picking over the data and trends. But it is pretty clear that Trump attracted the support of many middle-class and working-class voters, especially whites, who feel left out or left behind.
Race played a significant role here, with whites reacting (almost entirely incorrectly) to a sense that Americans of color were overtaking them. But inequality in general has become a lively political issue—indeed, the “defining challenge of our time,” according to Obama. Too often , however, the rhetoric of inequality points to a “top 1 percent” problem, as if the “bottom” 99 percent is in a similarly dire situation. In fact, it is the Americans in the top fifth of the income distribution—broadly, households with incomes above the $112,000 mark—that are separating from the rest. This separation is economic, visible in bank balances and salaries. But it can also be seen in education, family structure, health and longevity, even in civic and community life.
Trump’s success among middle-class whites might seem surprising, given his own wealth. But his supporters have no problem with the rich. In fact, they admire them.  His movement was about class, not money, and he exuded the blue-collar culture. For his supporters, the enemy is upper middle-class professionals: journalists, scholars, technocrats, managers, bureaucrats, the people with letters after their names. You and me.
The glass floor protecting affluent children from falling is also a glass ceiling, blocking upward mobility for those born on a lower rung of the ladder.
And here is the difficult part. The popular obsession with the top 1 percent allows the upper middle class to convince ourselves we are in the same boat as the rest of America; but it is not true.  However messily it is expressed, much of the criticism of our class is true. We proclaim the “net” benefits of free trade, technological advances, and immigration, safe in the knowledge that we will be among the beneficiaries. Equipped with high levels of human capital, we can flourish in a global economy. The cities we live in are zoned to protect our wealth, but deter the unskilled from sharing in it. Professional licensing and an immigration policy tilted toward the low-skilled shield us from the intense market competition faced by those in nonprofessional occupations. We proclaim the benefits of free markets but are largely insulated from the risks they can pose. Small wonder other folks can get angry.
The upper middle class has been having it pretty good. It is about time those of us in the favored fifth recognized our privileged position. Some humility and generosity is required. But there is clearly some work to do in terms of raising awareness. Right now, there is something of a culture of entitlement among America’s upper middle class. Partly this is because of a natural tendency to compare ourselves to those even better off than us. This is the “we are the 99 percent” problem. But it is also because we feel entitled to our position since it results from our own merit: our education, brains, and hard work.
These problems were illuminated by the 529 furor. Veteran tax scholar Howard Gleckman noted sadly that the demise of Obama’s plan “reflected the lack of serious interest in reform by most lawmakers today.” I think it reflected something much worse. The lawmakers were fairly honestly reflecting the views of their constituents and reacting to commentary in the media. But there was a lack of interest in self-reflection by the upper middle class. Those of you who don’t follow tax history closely may not recall that it was George W. Bush who, in 2001, gave us the chance to grow capital tax free in 529 plans. When Republicans proposed it during Bill Clinton’s second term, he promptly vetoed it. Look how a regressive, Bush-era tax cut can become so precious to the upper middle class, including its most liberal members.

I am British by birth, but I have lived in the United States since 2012 and became a citizen in late 2016. There are lots of reasons I have made America my home, but one of them is the American ideal of opportunity. I always hated the walls created by social class distinctions in the United Kingdom. The American ideal of a classless society is, to me, a deeply attractive one. It has been disheartening to learn that the class structure of my new homeland is, if anything, more rigid than the one I left behind and especially so at the top.
Indeed, the American upper middle class is leaving everyone else in the dust. The top fifth of U.S. households saw a $4 trillion increase in pretax income in the years between 1979 and 2013.  The combined rise for the bottom 80 percent, by comparison, was just over $3 trillion. The gap between the bottom fifth and the middle fifth has not widened at all. In fact, there has been no increase in inequality below the eightieth percentile. All the inequality action is above that line.
Income growth has not been uniform within the top fifth, of course: a third of the income rise went to the top 1 percent alone. But that still left $2.7 trillion for the 19 percent just beneath them. Failing to join the ranks of the plutocrats does not mean life as a pauper. It is not just the “upper class” that has been flourishing. A much broader swath of American society is doing well—and detaching themselves.
These facts can cause some discomfort. Few of us want to be associated with the hated super-rich. Very often it seems to be those quite near the top of the distribution who are most angry with those at the very top: more than a third of the demonstrators on the May Day “Occupy” march in 2011 had annual earnings of more than $100,000.  But, rather than looking up in envy and resentment, the upper middle class would do well to look at their own position compared to those falling further and further behind.
Even the most liberal pundits don’t want to make us look in the mirror. In his book Twilight of the Elites, the liberal broadcaster and writer Chris Hayes positions the upper middle class as losing out: “The upper middle class [are] people with graduate school degrees, homes, second homes, kids in good colleges, and six-figure incomes. This frustrated, discontented class has spent a decade with their noses pressed up against the glass, watching the winners grab more and more for themselves, seemingly at the upper middle class’s expense.”
Trump's supporters have no problem with the rich. Their real enemy is the upper middle class.
Hayes may be right about the frustration and discontent. Much of the political energy behind both the Bernie Sanders left and the Tea Party right came from the upper middle class. But Hayes is wrong to imply that the frustration is warranted, or that the very rich are gaining “at the upper middle class’s expense.” As the 2016 election helped us to see, the real class divide is not between the upper class and the upper middle class: it is between the upper middle class and everyone else.
Politicians don’t help much, either. Democrats took fright at the plans to remove precious 529 upper middle-class tax breaks. Some elected officials also seem to have a warped view of the income distribution. According to Representative Marlin Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, the 529 plan beneficiaries are “as middle class as it gets.” Really? Most of the tax benefit from 529 plans goes to households with incomes over $200,000. Congressman, that’s not the middle: median household income at the time was just under $54,000.
None of this is to say we should disregard the growing inequality at the very top. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the amassing of extreme wealth and, specifically, how it is distorting the political process. But the upper middle class has outsized political power, too. An individual billionaire can have a disproportionate influence on an individual politician (in Donald Trump’s case, by becoming one). But the size and strength of the upper middle class means that it can reshape cities, dominate the education system, and transform the labor market. The upper middle class also has a huge influence on public discourse, counting among its members most journalists, think-tank scholars, TV editors, professors, and pundits in the land.
• • •
Compounding this problem is the fact that upper middle-class children are advantaged from birth. In particular, their upbringing ensures they develop the skills, attributes, and credentials valued in the labor market. By the time Americans are old enough to drink alcohol, their place in the class system is clear.
Upper middle-class parents obviously have more money to spend on their children, but there is also a social fracture. Class is not only defined in dollars, but by education, attitude, and zip code, by its way of life. America, warns Robert Putnam in Our Kids, faces “an incipient class apartheid.”
The typical child born and raised in the American upper middle class is raised in a stable home by well-educated, married parents, lives in a great neighborhood, and attends the area’s best schools. They develop a wide range of skills and gain an impressive array of credentials. Upper middle-class children luck out right from the start, even though this country was founded on antihereditary principles.
As part of the process of naturalization, I had to sign part 12, question 4 of Form N-400, which reads as follows: “Are you willing to give up any inherited title(s) or order(s) of nobility that you have in a foreign country?” I had none to give up, sadly, but very much enjoyed this question. Inheriting a particular position is un-American, after all. But while the inheritance of titles or positions remains forbidden, the persistence of class status across generations in the United States is very strong. Too strong, in fact, for a society that prides itself on social mobility.
The obsession with the top 1 percent allows the upper middle class to believe they are in the same boat as the rest of America. They are not.
There is a lot of concern among politicians and scholars about the lack of relative social mobility in the United States. But what is really striking is that the greatest class persistence is at the top. Gary Solon, the godfather of mobility studies, describes U.S. mobility like this: “[Rather than] a poverty trap, there seems instead to be more stickiness at the other end: a ‘wealth trap’ if you will. There are probably more rags to riches cases than the other way around . . . there seems to be better safety nets for the offspring of the wealthy.”
There is clear danger of a vicious cycle developing here. As inequality between the upper middle class and the rest grows, parents will become more determined to ensure their children stay near the top. We will work hard to put a “glass floor” under them, to prevent them from falling down the chutes. Inequality and immobility thus become self-reinforcing.
Downward mobility is not a wildly popular idea, to say the least. But it is a stubborn mathematical fact that, at any given time, the top fifth of the income distribution can accommodate only 20 percent of the population. Relative intergenerational mobility is necessarily a zero-sum game. For one person to move up the ladder, somebody else must move down. Sometimes that will have to be one of our own children. Otherwise the glass floor protecting affluent kids from falling acts also as a glass ceiling, blocking upward mobility for those born on a lower rung of the ladder. The problem we face is not just class separation, but class perpetuation.
• • •
There are two factors driving class perpetuation at the top: the unequal development of “market merit” and some unfair “opportunity hoarding.”
In a market economy, the people who develop the skills and attributes valued in the market will have better outcomes. That probably sounds kind of obvious. But it has important implications. It means, for example, that we can have a meritocratic market in a deeply unfair society, if “merit” is developed highly unequally and largely as a result of the lottery of birth.
Human capital has become more important in the labor market, a trend that Brink Lindsey describes as “the cephalization of economic life.”13 Education has therefore become the main mechanism for the reproduction of upper middle-class status across generations. This helps to explain the virulent reactions to the 529 reforms. By targeting a tax break for education, specifically college education, the president threatened something sacred to the upper middle-class tribe. (The Obamas included: in 2007 alone they put $240,000 in the 529 plans for their daughters.)
Americans have historically lauded education as the great equalizer, allowing individuals to determine their own path in life regardless of background. But if this was ever true, it certainly is not today. Postsecondary education in particular has become an “inequality machine.” As more ordinary people have earned college degrees, upper middle-class families have simply upped the ante. Postgraduate qualifications are now the key to maintaining upper middle-class status. The upper middle class gains most of its status not by exploiting others but by exploiting its own skills. But when the income gap of one generation is converted into an opportunity gap for the next, economic inequality hardens into class stratification.
Class rigidities of this kind may blunt market dynamism by reducing the upward flow of talent and leaving human capital underutilized among the less fortunate. To take just one narrow example, fund managers from poor backgrounds perform better than those from more affluent families, controlling for a range of institutional factors, according to one study. It seems likely that this is because they have to be smarter in the first place in order to make it into financial services.
Increasing the number of smart, poor kids making it to the top of the labor market is likely to mean an improvement in quality and therefore productivity. Market competition is not only essential for growth and prosperity; it also provides an opportunity for meritocratic social mobility, but only if there are fair chances to acquire the kind of merit that is being rewarded. Right now we have meritocracy without mobility.
We can’t say we weren’t warned. The Rise of the Meritocracy, Michael Young’s 1959 book that coined the term, describes a dystopia in which “those who are judged to have merit of a certain kind harden into a new social class without room in it for others.”
• • •
Not all upper middle-class advantage results from an open contest, however. We also engage in some opportunity hoarding, accessing valuable, finite opportunities by unfair means. This amounts to rigging the market in our favor.
When we hoard opportunities, we help our own children but hurt others by reducing their chances of securing those opportunities. Every college place or internship that goes to one of our kids because of a legacy bias or personal connection is one less available to others. We may prefer not to dwell on the unfairness here, but that’s simply a moral failing on our part. Too many upper middle-class Americans still insist that their success, or the success of their children, stems entirely from brilliance and tenacity; “born on third base, thinking they hit a triple,” in football coach Barry Switzer’s vivid phrase.
Dream hoarders flourish in a global economy. They proclaim the benefits of free markets but are insulated from the risks they pose.
Three opportunity hoarding mechanisms stand out in particular: exclusionary zoning in residential areas; unfair mechanisms influencing college admissions, including legacy preferences; and the informal allocation of internships. Each of these tilts the playing field in favor of upper middle-class children. Brink Lindsey and Steven Teles see these as evidence of a “captured economy.” Reihan Salam dubs it “incumbent protection.” I call it a glass floor, which protects the upper middle class against the risk of downward mobility.
There is one point that I probably can’t stress enough: being an opportunity hoarder is not the same thing as being a good parent. Many of the things we do for our kids—reading stories, helping with homework, providing good food, supporting their sports and extracurricular activities—will equip them to be more successful in the world and increase their chances of remaining in the upper middle class. All of this is great—indeed, laudable. Much of what the upper middle class does ought to be emulated. The problem comes when we use our power to distort competition.
Opportunity hoarding is bad for society in the same way that commercial market rigging is bad for the economy. It is good that parents want the best for their kids, just as it is good that company directors want to make profits. But companies should make their profits by competing fairly in the marketplace. That’s why we stop them from forming cartels. In just the same way, we need to stop parents from rigging the market to benefit their own kids. Right now, the markets that shape opportunity, especially in housing and education, are rigged in our favor.
• • •
There is much that can be done to equalize chances to acquire education and skills as well as to curb opportunity hoarding. The first priorities focus on equalizing human capital development so that the distribution of “market merit” is more even. Specifically, I propose reducing unintended pregnancy rates by expanding access to better contraception; narrowing the parenting gap by investing in home visiting; paying the best teachers to work in poorer schools; and making college funding more equal (including, yes, those 529 plans).
But we also need to take aim at reducing opportunity hoarding by curbing exclusionary zoning through fairer land use regulation; widening the doors into postsecondary education (entailing the abolition of legacy admissions); and opening up internships. Here the goal is largely to reduce anticompetitive behaviors, to make the contest itself a little fairer.
This is not a comprehensive list, but my goal is to show that there is much that can be done if the political will and money can be found. There will be price tags attached to some of these policies, of course, but the upper middle class can be asked and can afford to pay.
The problem is that many of these efforts are likely to run into the solid wall of upper middle-class resistance, even those that simply require a slightly higher tax bill. A change of heart is needed: a recognition of privilege among the upper middle class, the ability to hold up a mirror. Some of us in the upper middle class already feel a degree of cognitive dissonance about the advantages we pile up for our own kids, compared to the truncated opportunities we know exist for others. We want our children to do well, but also want to live in a fairer society. My friend and colleague E. J. Dionne put it to me this way: “I spend my weekdays decrying the problem of inequality, but then I spend my evenings and weekends adding to it.”
We are all guilty, on some level, of taking actions on our children’s behalf that conferred an unfair advantage. If more of us start to feel Dionne’s cognitive dissonance, some political space might open up for reforms. The big question is then whether we are willing to make some modest sacrifices in order to expand opportunities for others or whether, deep down, we would rather pull up the ladder.

As he put the final touches to a book, the historian James Truslow Adams was pleased with his idea for the title: The American Dream. But his publishers told him not to be silly. Americans were a practical people. They would never buy a book about a dream. (It was published in 1931 as The Epic of America.) But his phrase, nonetheless, jumped off the page and into common use. The American dream, according to Adams, is “a dream of being able to grow to the fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in older civilizations . . . for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being.”
The American dream is not about superwealth or celebrity. The American dream is of a decent home in a pleasant neighborhood, good schools for our kids, a steadily rising income, and enough money put aside for an enjoyable retirement. It is about sustaining a strong family and seeing your children off to a good college.
It has become a staple of politicians to declare the American dream dying or dead. But it is not dead. It is alive and well; but it is being hoarded by those of us in the upper middle class.

Chaim Gartenberg,"As is practically tradition, HMD Global has come to Mobile World Congress with a new lineup of Nokia phones, and this years group includes budget devices with some clever new features.
That starts with the Nokia 4.2, a new class of phone for the company designed to slot in between the pricier Nokia 5 line and the cheaper Nokia 3. The 4.2 is meant to offer an affordable flagship experience, with premium features like a notched 5.71-inch display, glass front and back design, dual camera system, and a fingerprint sensor without breaking the $200 mark.
The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 processor, so its definitely not the fastest device around. Its rounded out by a 3,000 mAh battery and either 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage or 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage. 
But the most interesting part of the Nokia 4 is its buttons. Theres a dedicated Google Assistant button, which Nokia is loading with a few tricks: press it once to trigger the Assistant, twice to bring up Googles Visual Snapshot view, and press and hold to keep the mic open for a conversational, always listening mode like on a full smart speaker. 
Theres also a breathing notification light integrated into the power button. If the device is face down, the light will gently glow when you have new notifications, which is a clever feature. The Nokia 4 will cost either $169 or $199 depending on the storage configuration, although Nokia isnt sure yet which configurations will come to the US when the phone launches in April. 
Nokia 3.2
Next is the Nokia 3.2, an updated version of the 3.1 thats getting the same dedicated Google Assistant and glowing power buttons, a larger 6.26-inch notched display, and a beefy 4,000 mAh battery. 
The 3.2 has the same Snapdragon 439 processor and 2GB RAM / 16GB storage and 3GB RAM / 32GB storage options as the 4.2. But the 3.2 does lack a few of the 4.2s nicer features, like the glass back (its plastic, instead) and the fingerprint sensor. It is a bit cheaper though, set to cost $169 and $139, depending on the storage/RAM option. Like the Nokia 4.2, the Nokia 3.2 will also launch in April. 
Nokia 1
HMD is also announcing the $99 Nokia 1 Plus, which is meant to improve upon last years Nokia 1 as a sort of entry-level smartphone for folks looking to upgrade from a feature phone for the first time. 
It features a 5.45-inch 18:9 display, removable back cover with replaceable battery, and is thinner than last years model. Crucially, itll also run Android 9 Pie Go, instead of the larger Android 9 Pie, and will be available in early March.
Nokia 210
Lastly, theres the Nokia 210, a proper, classic Nokia feature phone. As you might expect, the specs here are nothing to be amazed by: a 2.4-inch QVGA display and 16MB of memory. But, it also does have Snake, physical keys, a removable 1,020mAh battery, an FM radio, and even an app store (for apps designed for Nokias proprietary, Java-based feature phone OS). Itll cost $35 when it comes out later this year.","As is practically tradition, HMD Global is at MWC 2019 with a new lineup of its Nokia phones, spanning the range from budget Android options to featurephones that are designed to offer new options along the company’s entire range.",2019-02-24T15:30:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Nokia bets big on buttons with its new budget phones,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18236618/nokia-4-3-1-plus-210-buttons-google-assistant-mwc-2019,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkHBj4MrmrUtyaSdIig3Rm0viJI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130573/bfarsace_190210_3229_0029.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-1,1
Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s dominant ride-hailing company, is continuing its international expansion after it announced plans to launch in Australia this month. The company — which bought Uber’s China business in 2016 — said it will begin serving customers in Melbourne from June 25 following a month-long trial period in Geelong, a neighboring city that’s 75km away. The business will be run by a Didi subsidiary in Australia and it plans to offer “a series of welcome packages to both drivers and riders” — aka discounts and promotions, no doubt. It began signing up drivers on June 1, the company added. The Australia launch will again put Didi in direct competition with Uber, but that is becoming increasingly common, and also Ola which counts Didi as an investor — more on that below. This move follows forays into Taiwan, Mexico and Brazil this year as Didi has finally expanded beyond its China-based empire. Didi raised $4 billion in December to develop AI, general technology and to fund international expansion and it has taken a variety of routes to doing the latter. This Australia launch is organic, with Didi developing its own team, while in Taiwan it has used a franchise model and it went into Brazil via acquisition, snapping up local Uber-rival 99 at a valuation of $1 billion. It is also set to enter Japan where it has teamed up with investor SoftBank on a joint-venture. “In 2018, Didi will continue to cultivate markets in Latin America, Australia and Japan. We are confident a combination of world-class transportation AI technology and deep local expertise will bring a better experience to overseas markets,” the company added in a statement. This international expansion has also brought a new level of confusion since Didi has cultivated relationships with other ride-hailing companies across the world while also expanding its own presence internationally. The Uber deal brought with it a stock swap — turning Didi and Uber from competitors into stakeholders — and the Chinese company has also backed Grab in Southeast Asia, Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India, Careem in the Middle East and — most recently — Taxify, which covers Europe and Africa. In the case of Australia, Didi will come up against both Uber and Ola, with the India firm currently present in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney via an expansion made earlier this year. Uber vs Didi is to be expected — that’s a complicated relationship — but in taking on Ola (so soon after it came to Australia), Didi is competing directly with a company that it funded via an investment deal for the first time. That might be a small insight into Didi’s relationship with Ola. Unlike Grab, which has seen Didi follow-on its investments, the Chinese firm sat out Ola’s most recent fundraising last year despite making an investment in the company back in 2015. Ola declined to comment. Didi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its new rivalry with Ola Down Under. The move into Australia comes at a time when Didi is under intense pressure following the death of a passenger uses its ‘Hitch’ service last month. The company suspended the Hitch service — which allows groups people who are headed in the same direction together — and removed a number of features while limiting its operations to day-time only. This week, it said it would resume night-time rides but only for drivers picking up passengers of the sex.","Didi Chuxing, China’s dominant ride-hailing company, is continuing its international expansion after it announced plans to launch in Australia this month.

Nitasha Tiku,"Oracle allegedly paid some female employees more than $13,000 less per year, on average, than male employees in similar roles, according an analysis of Oracles own pay data revealed Friday as part of a gender bias lawsuit against the company. The analysis was performed by economist David Neumark, a professor at University of California, Irvine, who claims the likelihood of such a disparity occuring by chance is less than one in 1 billion.
Neumarks analysis was submitted in support of a motion to pursue the case against Oracle, filed in 2017, as a class action on behalf of 4,200 female employees who worked in the companys product development, information technology, and support functions since 2013. The analysis shows that women are paid less even after controlling for career level, performance review scores, office location, tenure at Oracle, and overall work experience, in violation of Californias Equal Pay Act. The analysis excluded employees hired directly after college. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The analysis found that most of the difference in earnings between men and women stemmed from bonuses and stock grants, rather than base pay. Womens base pay was 3.8 percent less than comparable men, according to the analysis. But womens bonuses, on average, were 13.2 percent less than men in the same job codes; for stock grants, the disparity was 33.1 percent.
The disparity in base pay arose largely from Oracles practice until October 2017 of relying on an employees prior pay when setting initial salaries, according to Neumarks analysis. For lateral hires, the company required recruiters to ask about a workers current pay level. All six of the named plaintiffs in the case have left Oracle. Three of them joined Oracle when the company acquired PeopleSoft in 2004.
Oracle stopped the practice of looking at prior pay in October 2017, when then-Governor Jerry Brown signed a law prohibiting employers from asking applicants about their salary histories. However, the plaintiffs argue that Oracle should have known and rectified the disparity earlier because of a prior change to state law, which took effect January 1, 2017, prohibiting employers from justifying unlawful pay differences based on an applicants prior salary alone, in order to avoid perpetuating discrimination.
Oracles median pay is significantly lower than other software companies such as Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The gender bias allegations in the ongoing lawsuit are not unique to Oracle. James Finberg, an attorney with Altshuler Berzon representing the female Oracle employees, is also representing female Google employees in a suit alleging systemic bias in pay and promotion. Unequal pay is one facet of widespread institutional discrimination in Silicon Valley against women, who also face sexual harassment, less access to venture capital funding, and lack of representation in the industrys upper echelons.
Finberg says he became interested in potential bias at Oracle after the US Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Oracle, a government contractor, in January 2017, alleging systemic pay discrimination against female, African-American, and Asian employees, as well as systemic hiring discrimination against non-Asian applicants in product development and other technical roles. Earlier this month, a judge denied an Oracle request to dismiss that suit.
Oracle tried to block the release of federally mandated diversity reports (submitted annually to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) for more than a year, arguing that the information was a trade secret, according to report earlier this month by Reveal, which found that fewer than 13 percent of Oracles executives were women in 2015.

Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders: The global oligarchy is growing while millions live in dire poverty To curb this inequality, we need a fair, transparent taxation system, Sanders writes Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a former presidential candidate, is serving his second term in the US Senate. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) One of the major, untold stories of our time is the rapid movement toward global oligarchy, in which just a handful of billionaires now own and control a significant part of the world economy. Here in the United States, the top one-tenth of 1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Incredibly, according to a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies, three of the richest people in America -- Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett -- now own more wealth than bottom 160 million people in our country. But this is clearly not just an American issue. It is a global issue. While millions of people throughout the world live in dire poverty, without clean drinking water, adequate health care, decent housing, or education for their kids, the six wealthiest people in the world as ranked by Forbes Magazine own more wealth, according to Oxfam, than the bottom half of the world's population, 3.6 billion people. This massive level of wealth and income inequality, and the political power associated with that wealth, is an issue that cannot continue be ignored. We must fight back. Thanks to the so-called Paradise Papers, a trove of millions of documents analyzed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and its collaborating news outlets, we now have a better understanding of how the largest corporations and wealthiest people in the world avoid paying their taxes and hide ownership of assets. Needless to say, these billionaires are all strong supporters of our military, our veterans, our infrastructure, our schools and other government services. They would just prefer that you pay for those activities, not them. According to the ICIJ's investigative reporting, the Americans listed as having offshore accounts in the Paradise Papers, (which have not been independently reviewed by CNN), are a who's who of billionaires, some of whom are the very same officials who have led the effort to promote the Republican tax plan, which would provide even more tax-avoiding opportunities to the very rich. Even before these revelations, we knew that tax dodging by the wealthy and large corporations, not just in the US but globally, was taking place on a massive scale. In 2012, the Tax Justice Network, a British advocacy group, estimated that at least $21 trillion was stashed in offshore tax havens around the world. In other words, while governments enact austerity budgets, which lower the standard of living of working people, the super-rich avoid their taxes. According to Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, individuals in the US are avoiding $36 billion through offshore tax schemes and US corporations are avoiding more than $130 billion through these schemes. The situation has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Caymans is now the "" home "" of nearly 20,000 corporations -- and that is just one of many tax havens operating across the globe. The essence of oligarchy is that the billionaire class is never satisfied with what they have. They want more, more and more -- no matter what impact their efforts have on working people, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor. Greed is their religion. While the oligarchs are avoiding their taxes, Trump and his Republican colleagues, ostensibly in order to save federal dollars, have been trying to throw tens of millions of Americans off of their health insurance, and make massive cuts in education, nutrition assistance and affordable housing. As a candidate for president, Trump promised that he would stand up for the working class of this country. Needless to say, that was a lie. Almost half of the benefits in the Trump/Republican tax plan would go to the top 1%, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Additionally, they want to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, even though in 2012 one out of every five large, profitable corporations in the US paid no federal income taxes at all and between 2008 and 2015, 18 corporations had a tax rate lower than 0%. Republicans also want to make it easier for companies to shelter their profits overseas and pay zero taxes. The ""territorial tax system"" they are proposing, which means companies would be taxed only on income earned within our country's borders, would exempt the offshore profits of American corporations from US taxes and allow for a one-time 12% tax on their offshore cash profits when brought back into the United States. Meanwhile, while the wealthy and large corporations are receiving huge tax breaks, nearly half of middle-class families would actually see their taxes go up by the end of the decade by eliminating deductions for medical expenses, student loan interest rates, state and local income and sales taxes, and the cost of health insurance for the self-employed. The Paradise Papers make it clearer than ever that we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent. Now is the time, in the United States and internationally, for people to come together to take on the greed of the oligarchs. We can and must create a global economy that works for all, not just a handful of billionaires.","Bernie Sanders says the Paradise Papers make it clearer than ever that the US and the world need tax systems which are fair, progressive, and transparent.",2017-11-13T12:56:10Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Bernie Sanders: We must end global oligarchy,http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/opinions/oligarchy-paradise-papers-bernie-sanders-opinion/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171018223921-bernie-sanders-10-18-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-1,1
"USA TODAY Sports, Lindsay Schnell, USA TODAY Sports","Tyson Campbell of American Heritage High School puts on a Georgia hat after announcing his is signing with the Bulldogs. (Photo: Taimy Alvarez, Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) National signing day lost a little bit of the glitz, glamour and drama this year after the first-ever early signing period in college football last December. But now that the 2018 recruiting period is really over, let’s catch up on what happened this cycle, and which teams had good — and bad — days. Georgia: The sting of losing a national championship should be lessened just a bit after Wednesday, when the Bulldogs flipped yet another four-star originally committed to Alabama. This is becoming a trend for UGA. Quay Walker is a 6-foot-3, 218-pound linebacker who endeared himself to Georgia fans not just by picking the Bulldogs but also by picking up a Tennessee hat — was he about to head to Knoxville?!—then flinging it to the side. Overall it was a tremendous day for the Bulldogs. They finished with the top-ranked class in the country, and signed a staggering seven five-star prospects, including No. 2 cornerback Tyson Campbell. Though head coach Kirby Smart said the ranking itself, “really does not float my boat, or this staff’s boat,” there is no doubt Georgia’s dominance on the recruiting trail will be a topic for months. TOP CLASSES: Ranking the schools that did the best on signing day BEHIND SCENES: What it is like to be a football recruit making signing decision TWITTER TROUBLE: College teams have accounts suspended on signing day Alabama: The Tide finished out of the top five in class composite rankings, which is unusual, and lost a couple big-time prospects, from Walker to four-star receiver Justyn Ross (he picked Clemson). The Tide were ranked No. 7 in 247sports.com’s composite class rankings; the last seven seasons, they’ve finished with the No. 1 class. But Alabama still managed to lock up one of the top players in the 2018 class: 6-2, 198-pound Patrick Surtain, Jr., of Plantation, Fla., is the highest rated cornerback prospect in the modern recruiting era, and he’s headed to Tuscaloosa. Yes, his dad is the former NFL cornerback of the same name. Florida State: What a way to close. The Seminoles, under new coach Willie Taggart, were ranked around No. 70 in the class composite rankings after the early signing period, but a strong last few weeks — including commits from four-stars receiver Warren Thompson, defensive end Malcolm Lamar and defensive tackle Dennis Briggs — vaulted FSU all the way to No. 11. Southern California: As always, it’s tough to lure kids away from the sunshine of Southern California. The Trojans signed five of the top six players from the state of California, and on Wednesday received commitments from five-star cornerbacks Olaijah Griffin and Isaac Taylor-Stuart, four-star receiver Devon Williams (who many believed was headed to Oregon) and four-star linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu. The flurry of late commits brought the Trojans up to No. 4 in 247sports.com composite class rankings. Arizona State: It seems that new coach Herm Edwards, an unconventional hire by the Sun Devils, has been mostly bewildered by recruiting and all the hoopla that comes with it. As such, ASU’s 2018 class was near the middle of the pack with the benefit of a nice finish. So far the Edwards Experiment is not going well in Tempe. Among the other top classes, Ohio State (No. 2), Texas (No. 3) and Penn State (No. 5) all had big days. Clemson also was solidly in the top 10 despite a small, yet talented class. It went the opposite way for Michigan. The Wolverines finished with the fifth and eighth ranked classes in 2017 and 2016, respectively, but dropped all the way to No. 21 this year. They were hurt by the last-minute defection of top linebacker Otis Reese to Georgia and missing out on offensive lineman Nicholas Petit-Frere to Ohio State. The low ranking also was partially due to signing fewer players. The Wolverines only signed 19 this year, compared with 30 and 28 the previous two years. Like most signing days, there was no shortage of drama. The memorable moment of the day came during the commitment ceremony of Jacob Copeland, one of the best receivers in the 2018 class. On live television, Copeland picked Florida over Alabama and Tennessee. His mom, who was wearing an Alabama sweater and Tennessee, got up from the table and walked away as soon as he put a Gators cap on his head. The story did have a happy ending as they hugged shortly afterward.

"Ralph Ellis, CNN","(CNN)The Los Angeles teachers' union rejected the school district's latest offer on Friday, meaning the union is ready to go on strike Monday morning, union leaders said at a news conference.
""At the end of today's session, we declared impasse,"" said Arlene Inouye, co-chair of the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) bargaining team.
Inouye said the school district's proposal was inadequate and that the district has made insufficient movement in their 21 months of bargaining.
The Los Angeles Unified School District issued this statement Friday night:
""We are extremely disappointed that United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) has rejected Los Angeles Unified's revised offer without proposing any counter offer. UTLA has refused to continue contract negotiations. More than 48 hours remain until Monday when UTLA plans to strike, and we implore UTLA to reconsider.""
In a tweet, the school district said it presented an offer that would ""significantly reduce class size and ensure no increase in any class size, increase nurses, counselors and librarians at all schools, along with a 6% salary increase and back pay for the 2017-2018 school year.""
But union president Alex Caputo-Pearl, speaking at the news conference, said the offer was good for only one year. He called it ""a woefully inadequate proposal"" and that a strike was imminent if another offer isn't made over the weekend.
If approximately 32,000 teachers and staff members do strike Monday, classes will continue at all schools.
About 600,000 students could be taught by more than 2,000 reassigned administrators and about 400 substitute teachers, the school district said. Exactly how that would work out logistically remains uncertain.
Union members say they want LAUSD to pull from its $1.86 billion in reserves to increase school staffing and to boost teachers' salaries by 6.5%.
But the school district says it doesn't have nearly as much money as the teachers' union thinks. The school district said it might not even have enough money to meet a required 1% reserve by the 2021-2022 school year.
Friday, Inouye said LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner did not show up to the bargaining. She said Beutner announced the school district's proposal to media before presenting it to UTLA.
""We are disrespected when we experienced this from the superintendent of LAUSD,"" Inouye said.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","I have a friend who took kindergarten prep very seriously. When her son began getting homework in preschool (homework and preschool being two words that should never go together) and he couldnt properly identify on the homework that car started with the letter C, she freaked out.
The poor kid was practically homeschooled over the summer, she later told me. I got a bunch of activity books and we worked on them. I think we did sight words, adding and subtracting, letter sounds and opposites. Pretty much all the stuff we did in kindergarten.
Since her son has a September birthday and would be among the youngest in his class, she felt sure she had to catch him up to where she imagined the other kids would be at the start of the year. But it backfired on her.
When he went to school, he knew it all, she told me. I got phone calls that he did his work and then went around the class and corrected the other kids.
Before Ryan started kindergarten a few years ago, and I worried that he wasnt yet reading at all, her advice to me was simple: Dont push it. Hell learn what he needs to learn in kindergarten. 
There is a lot of talk about how preschool is the new kindergarten and kindergarten is the new first grade, but does that mean our kids need to be more academically knowledgeable at that age than we were?
Most experts say no. What they need to start learning before kindergarten is more about life skills and less about whether they know that two plus two equals four. 
Marcy Guddemi, former executive director of the Gesell Institute of Child Development in New Haven, Conn., told Today.com that concepts that foster independence in kids should be introducedbut not necessarily masteredbefore they start kindergarten.
Guddemi insists that learning happens at different rates for different kids, and the best thing you can do for your child at this age is to encourage a love of learning. Hint: Its all about cultivating confidence and independence at this point.
So what should they be able to do before kindergarten?
They should be able to use books
Do kids need to learn to read before kindergarten? Definitely not. But they should know how books work. They should know how to hold a book and which way to turn the pages, and they should start to grasp that the story is told through the words, rather than simply with the pictures. 
You can get this point across by tracing the words with your fingers or pointing out specific words within the story. Reading to kids regularlyand having them see you readis the best way to guarantee theyll be lifelong readers, and thats more important than whether they can sound out words at five years old.
They should know some letters and numbers
If they recognize most letters and can count from 1-10, theyre right on track for kindergarten. They dont necessarily have to know what sound each letter makes, but recognizing letters and understanding that they are grouped together to make words is the first step to being able to read. They should also be able to identify some basic colors and shapes.
They should be able to write their first name
By kindergarten, kids should be getting pretty adept at writing their own name with the letters arranged in the correct order from left to right and, ideally, with a capital letter at the beginning (no need to panic about that last part, though). Their penmanship doesnt have to be perfect but clear enough for the teacher to be able to read it. 
They should have a little bit of independence
By kindergarten, kids should be able to mostly dress themselves, use the restroom on their own, pack up their own backpack and, in general, be able to ask for what they need. They should be able to use basic art supplies like crayons, glue sticks and safety scissors. And they should be able to separate from their parents without too much distress (this is something that is harder for some kids at the beginning of the year but should get easier over time).
They should be getting pretty good at cooperation
Kindergarteners should be able to share, take turns and be able to (mostly) listen and follow simple directions. This will obviously continue to be a work in progress for some time, but the concept of having to wait in a line or raise a hand before speaking should not be super new. (Ive also read some advice about how to teach them to sit still practice playing school at homebut I dont know... good luck with that.)
They should know some basic personal information
At five years old, kids should be able to state their first and last nameand if you can get them to memorize their address and phone number, thats even better. When I picked my son up from preschool one afternoon and he told me he had an assignment to memorize his address by the end of the week, I almost laughed in response. Learn his address? How on Earth was he going to memorize HIS ADDRESS?? But, I started reciting it to him over and over in a special sing-songy voice; to this day, hell still repeat it with the same cadence. Same with my cell phone number, which I taught him around the same time in case he ever got separated from me and needed to use someones phone to call me.
So, while kindergarten may be the new first grade in terms of length of the day and how quickly they progress academically during the year, theres no need to push the prep too much before theyre ready.",I have a friend who took kindergarten prep very seriously.

"kcorcoran@businessinsider.com (Kieran Corcoran), Kieran Corcoran","The Radcliffe Camera, part of Oxford University's campus. Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui, 39, said that his failure to get a first-class Oxford degree held him back. He attempted to sue the university for damages over his missed career opportunities. The judge said his lacklustre career was his own fault, and suggested that he ""lower his expectations."" An Oxford graduate, who tried to sue the university for £1 million ($1.4 million) because it gave him a lower degree result than he thinks he deserves, has had his case thrown out of court. Faiz Siddiqui, 39, missed his goal of getting a first-class degree after studying law at Brasenose College in 2000. He said he missed out on a glittering and lucrative career as a result, and tried to take Oxford to court, claiming that it was their poor teaching which denied him the qualification he allegedly deserved. But, despite the case reaching the High Court in London, the judge threw out the case on Wednesday, according to legal documents reviewed by Business Insider. Mr Justice Foksett said Siddiqui had failed to prove his case, and was essentially responsible for his own poor academic performance. News outlets including The Times newspaper pictured Siddiqui at a hearing earlier in the trial: Siddiqui was offered a training contract with law firm Clifford Chance after graduating and worked for a string of other law firms. He also had a spell at Ernst and Young, though he was later dismissed and is now unemployed. It fell far short of the career he desired: Siddiqui wanted a post-graduate qualification from Harvard, and envisioned making large sums of money from subsequent employment. Earlier in the trial, Siddiqui's lawyer described his client's 2:1 grade (an ""upper second-class"" degree, one below first-class) as an ""inexplicable failure"" which was cited as a reason he failed to get accepted as prestigious schools. However, the judge ruled that there were other factors at play. Oxford admitted that there were some flaws in its teaching during the time Siddiqui was a student, but argued that it wasn't reasonable to conclude that these faults were legally responsible for a students' lacklustre career 17 years later. Foksett agreed. In the conclusion to his judgment, he noted that Siddiqui has ""a firmly entrenched belief that all his post-Oxford problems lie with what occurred there. I have been unable to accept that this is so."" He suggested instead that he ""lower his expectations at least for the time being and start using his undoubted intelligence to create a worthwhile future for himself.""","Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui, 39, said that his failure to get a first-class Oxford degree held him back.

Sunday is my favorite day of the week, said Ms. Love, who lives in Chelsea. Its just really nice to be in places that arent too overwhelmed. Im always running, on the go, the city is always busy, so to feel the city when its less busy means a lot to me.
TEA, NEWS AND PREP When I wake up at 7, the city is quiet. You almost feel like the only one up, and I like that feeling. I am not a breakfast person, so Ill have a cup of tea and catch up on news, engage with the social media community; Ill go over my Nets scripts to prepare for games that week.

GET PUMPED I go to the 9:30 service at Redeemer Downtown on 14th Street, and I love hearing the sermon. It grounds me, reminds me how great God has been to me, my family and friends, and I leave more knowledgeable. Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer in Manhattan, is a well-known author, so I knew I wanted to check out his teaching when I came to New York. I found Redeemer and fell in love with the Bible-based teaching. Thats a priority to me. We can all preach on feelings, but teaching on truth is what I live for, and learn from.

SPIRIT AND BODY Right after church, I walk to 23rd Street and teach a 12:45 class at Peloton. Its a live class that is broadcast to all bikes and app members. Its literally my Feel Good Ride the name of the class as it allows me to bridge the gap of how great I feel from church and being on the bike, working out with thousands of riders at the same time, inspiring them through uplifting and encouraging language. I love Peloton because of its community. Its not only the leader in the hybrid of technology and fitness, but we are able to build social relationships that are magnified both on the bike, which uses a leader board that syncs with other riders, and off the bike, through real friendships across the country.
A LITTLE BUSINESS Ill get off my bike around 1:30 and meet with Faye Farrales, who helps me run Love Squad. Its really informal on Sundays, but were a small business, so its important to work in those off-peak hours and get ahead of the game so we know what were doing and build a strategy for the upcoming week.

HANG I meet my friends around 2:30 or 3 for afternoon brunch. My favorite place is Joseph Leonard on Waverly Place in the West Village. Theres usually a wait, so we have some drinks at the bar before sitting down. And it really depends on how much fun were having, but brunch can end anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30. When its over, Ill go home to change and meet my boyfriend, Andrew.

THE BOYFRIEND Andrew and I see each other every day. I start my mornings with him, and sometimes on Sundays he joins for church, and he often comes to class, as well, but we always meet up for comedy and dinner. At 8 we go to the stand-up show at the Village Underground on Third Street. We love to laugh, so comedy is perfect we thoroughly enjoy and respect those who can get up, live, and make people laugh. Making people laugh on the spot is real talent. Anyone can tell one good joke, but very few people can thread jokes together to tell a story, be impactful, and just make it super funny. My favorite comics include Hasan Minhaj, Stephen Colbert, Kevin James. After the show, we always go around the corner to Mint Masala on Macdougal Street for amazing Indian food. We love the curry chicken and lamb rogan josh.

"USA TODAY, Mike Jones, USA TODAY","Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) talks with defensive coordinator Gregg Williams before the game between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens at FirstEnergy Stadium. (Photo: Ken Blaze, USA TODAY Sports) Baker Mayfield wanted the challenge. Months before the Cleveland Browns made him the first pick of the 2018 NFL draft, he didn’t flinch at the prospect of joining the long-suffering franchise, which prior to his arrival had notoriously rotated through 28 starting quarterbacks since 1999. Mayfield made it known back in January at the Senior Bowl that he believed if anyone could end the Browns’ run of futility, it was him. He reiterated this belief a month later at the NFL scouting combine. Now, having played in just three games and taken the reins of Cleveland’s offense, the former Oklahoma star is making a believer out of his teammates, coaches and fans. On Sunday, Mayfield directed the Browns to a gutsy 12-9 overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens. The triumph not only gave the Browns their second of the season, but also their first against a divisional opponent since 2015. And once again, Mayfield impressed those closest to him. “I ain't been around you a long time, but one thing I know about you: you don't flinch,” Cleveland coach Hue Jackson told Mayfield in front of the rest of the team in his post-game locker room speech. “You keep playing and you keep bringing the guys in.” More: NFL Week 5 winners, losers: Baker Mayfield lifts Browns, Blake Bortles has brutal game More: 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2018 NFL season As is evident by the final score, points were difficult to come by for Cleveland. Mayfield threw for 342 yards and only one touchdown. He also threw an interception and completed just 25 of his 43 throws. However, when the pressure peaked, he displayed remarkable poise. Mayfield led his team all the way from its own 2-yard line and into range for the game-winning field goal. A 13-yard scramble and a 39-yard completion proved critical on the drive. During that performance, Jackson and Browns players witnessed another display of Mayfield's resilience and determination. But this wasn’t new news to everyone within the organization. Mayfield’s mental makeup drew the Browns to him, and it was what separated him from all of the other talented quarterback prospects. When general manager John Dorsey and his staff evaluated passers leading up to the draft, they chose not to put great stock in Mayfield’s physical attributes. They didn’t care that he’s considered undersized at just under 6-1 and 215 pounds. They didn’t worry that he didn’t have the same pure arm strength that some of the other quarterbacks available did. The confidence with which Mayfield carried himself both on the field and during pre-draft interviews made Browns leadership fall in love. During their talks with people from Oklahoma, they learned that Mayfield possesses a knack for getting his teammates to rally around him. Some of it stems from his communication skills and his ability to find ways to identify with teammates regardless of their differing backgrounds. His body language and presence in the huddle are also factors. The Browns learned that Oklahoma teammates found Mayfield’s swagger contagious. They also found his refusal to hang his head after mistakes or losses inspiring and motivating. No moment seemed too big for Mayfield in college, and the Browns thought the same would apply in the NFL. Jackson and his assistants still planned to groom the rookie gradually, but once he shined in place of an injured Tyrod Taylor in Week 3 and directed Cleveland to their first win since 2016, they realized it was impossible to keep him on the bench any longer. After flying high in that comeback victory, Mayfield came back to earth last week at Oakland. He threw for 295 yards and two touchdowns, but he also tossed two interceptions and lost two fumbles in a 45-42 overtime defeat. Mayfield blamed himself for the loss and vowed to do better. SportsPulse: Our top NFL reporters breakdown the top storylines from Week 5, including the continued confusion and outrage over the roughing the passer calls. USA TODAY Despite the disappointing result for a re-invigorated Cleveland team, some close to Mayfield saw the benefits of the rookie having endured such an outing. The narrow margin of defeat served as a valuable lesson on the importance of ball security. As Mayfield took the field against Baltimore, he was determined to show he could rebound from the previous week's disappointment. And he delivered. Now, Browns teammates are learning that Mayfield is the same guy they heard about and observed from a far at Oklahoma. They’re talking about him the same way his Sooners teammates and coaches did. “When I first saw the video of him dancing when he was in college at OU, that is when I knew that Baker was a different breed,” Browns running back Carlos Hyde said on a conference call with reporters on Monday. “He is not like most quarterbacks. He has some swag to him. I love it, especially from the quarterback position. I say that because of the way he plays and the way he carries himself – a guy who has been here and done it before like it is nothing new to him.” Said wide receiver Jarvis Landry on Sunday: “It’s his attitude and charisma. Like I said, he didn’t budge. He didn’t flinch. He continued to find ways to get the ball in people’s hands and let them make plays, and that’s the biggest thing. It shows the amount of trust he has in everybody.” Now 2-2-1, the Browns find themselves squarely in the race for the AFC North. Yes, there are still 11 games left. But Mayfield has given the Browns reason to believe that their rebuild may proceed at a quicker-than-anticipated pace. Follow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.

NELLIE BOWLES,"Every morning is dance awake, a chakra meditation and guitar class where Esalen guests dance across the large hardwood floor. Down in the kitchen, Mr. Kallayil’s assistant collected a large bag of raisins for eating during meditation. “I just sold my start-up and needed a place to reflect,” said Sam McBride, 31, from Chicago. “To give me some perspective.” Esalen’s hot springs are good all day but are famous for the night scene, when they open to the public between 1 and 3 a.m. A weekend stay for a couple at Esalen can cost $2,890, so budget travelers stay nearby and come wandering in with towels a little after midnight. The dirt path to the baths leads to a concrete corridor and a changing room. Around a corner, it was pitch black with an overpowering smell of sulfur. As the eyes adjusted to starlight, big steaming concrete hot tubs, claw-foot personal tubs and a couple of dozen quiet naked bodies could be seen. The space cannot be photographed. “I was tired of my life,” said Marina Kurikhina, 32, who lives on a ranch nearby. “I represented Latin American art at a gallery in London. Now I teach creative subconscious painting.” She said people visited Esalen “for transformation.” Soon, she plans to open a health bar on site serving raw desserts, cold-pressed juices and high-end coffee. Photo Esalen also holds art classes at the art barn. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times Photo Cortlan Robertson had intentions of his children attending Esalen’s Gazebo preschool program before it was recently canceled. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times With the focus on the emotional life of executives, Esalen plans to close Gazebo, its preschool of 40 years. “It was the soul of the institution of Esalen — all those little babies and what they’re going to be,” said Zoe Garcia, a guest and nearby resident, who has been going to Esalen for 30 years. The closing is partly a sign of the region’s changing demographics. As more of Big Sur’s homes are bought by tech executives as second homes, there are not as many young children, so the class of 30 had dwindled to 15 before the floods shut it down. “It’s incredibly sad,” said Cortlan Robertson, whose daughter attended Gazebo and who said the Big Sur community had offered to pay for the preschool to continue. “Ben is always saying it’s just child care. But it was so much more.” Closing Gazebo was also a sign of a shifting culture and new rules. “Back then, we could go topless in the lodge,” Ms. Garcia said. “More conservative people started to come, so they started to make rules. Now next is mindfulness and technology. Who knows?” Mr. Tauber was a surprising pick to head a retreat center. He had previously founded a real - time celebrity geo-stalking service called JustSpotted when Google hired him and his team in 2011. Soon after, he vacationed in Big Sur and decided his work was causing harm, he said. “I realized I was addicting people to their phones,” Mr. Tauber said. “It’s a crisis that everyone’s in the culture of killing it, and inside they’re dying.” In the hot spring one night, he ran into an Esalen leader who invited him to a conscious business event. Mr. Tauber quit Google to open a business coaching start-up founders and developed Esalen’s technology strategy, joining the board in 2015. During the springtime flooding, as Esalen cut its staff to 50 from 330, Mr. Tauber took over. His plan is to aim programming at top executives. “How do we scale our impact as an organization?” he asked. “We do it through impacting the influencers.” His house is a wood-and-stone half circle built into the hillside, looking out through the cypress onto the water. He wanted a better view so had the cypress pruned. He has a ukulele, a prayer bowl and various massage tools by the sofa. By the dying embers of a fire that he makes every morning, he was reading a history of Esalen and a Summer of Love coffee table book. Upstairs, the Inner-Net class was doing a compassion exercise. Everyone spent 10 minutes looking into a stranger’s eyes and silently repeating phrases like “this person has emotions just like me,” “this person has experienced pain and suffering just like me,” “this person will die just like me.” They were barefoot.

WINNIE HU,"“It’s not fair, it’s not equitable,” she said. “All kids should have access to all the schools — and not because you live in a certain neighborhood and your parents have access to certain resources.” At the request of parents and local elected officials, the city education department spent $150,000 to hire an urban planning firm, WXY Studio, to lead a community process to come up with a way to integrate the middle schools. Hundreds of parents and educators have worked collaboratively over the past year — largely avoiding the drama of District 3 — on a plan that will be presented this summer. In District 3, a battle erupted two years ago when school zones were redrawn to reduce crowding and increase diversity at elementary schools. One of the schools involved was Public School 199, a high-performing elementary school on the Upper West Side where parents hire tutors to ensure their children excel on state tests, and where the angry meeting caught on video took place. The district’s middle-school effort has drawn a variety of criticisms from parents. Some say it is unfair, since there are not enough seats for all the qualified applicants at the top schools, and that it could lower the quality of education. Others say it doesn’t do enough to help lower-performing middle schools. Robin Aronow, a school consultant, said that she had received a flood of calls from parents who are anxious about the plan and are considering applying to private schools in addition to public schools. City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Democrat from the Upper West Side, said the goal should be to increase the academic and economic diversity in every school, though she also understood the concerns raised by some white, middle-class parents. “This is about, ‘I don’t want to lose a spot for my kid,’” she said. Under the plan that was initially unveiled, every District 3 school would offer 10 percent of its sixth-grade seats to students who average a 1 on state tests — the lowest grade on a 1-to-4 scale — and another 15 percent to those who average a 2. For the current school year, only 11 percent of Booker T. Washington’s 299 admission offers went to these students.","At the Booker T.

Kellen Beck,"You may remember that the Pokémon Go Fest that happened last summer did not go so well. Well, on top of giving attendees refunds and bonus in-game currency to make up for the terrible event, developer Niantic is paying out over $1 million to disappointed visitors. After getting hit with a class action lawsuit over the disastrous Pokémon Go Fest, Niantic is settling with attendees and shelling out $1.6 million to cover the costs of travel and lodging to make up for the event, TechCrunch reported Friday. SEE ALSO: Supercut of the disastrous 'Pokémon Go' Fest is here to make you cringe Players who went to the first-ever Pokémon Go Fest in Chicago last year expected to get into the event without a hitch and be able to play the game that everyone came to celebrate. Unfortunately, there were very long lines that stretched for blocks and attendees were having trouble connecting to Pokémon Go 's servers, kind of ruining the whole point of the event. Throughout the day, Niantic was trying to put out fires, but the whole thing was being live streamed and live Tweeted so the world was well-aware of how poorly the event was going. To make up for it, Niantic offered attendees ticket refunds ($20) and in-game items (valued at $100), but many people traveled to Chicago specifically for the event, which meant they had added costs like airfare, hotels, and more.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Waterways across the Carolinas and beyond swelled to record-breaking levels this week, with several rising more than 20 feet above their averages, according to National Weather Service data. The Cape Fear and Lumber Rivers were forecast to rise as high or even higher than they did during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, North Carolina officials said. Christian Dreyer has seen this kind of flooding before, and he knows that the worst is yet to come. As a volunteer member of a New Jersey search-and-rescue team, he helped pull people from rushing floodwaters in this part of North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew. Now he’s back with the same group, New Jersey Task Force 1, helping rescue people from their flooded homes in Washington, N.C., just north of New Bern. The crew got some people out in vehicles, but in other cases, they had to drive boats up to their front doors. The flooding right now is caused mostly by storm surge, as the swollen ocean pushes rivers over their banks. It’s slow moving, Mr. Dreyer said, especially compared to the rushing floodwaters that will soon come from the opposite direction, down the rivers, as up to 40 inches of rain falls inland. “A surge is like a bathtub flooding,” said Mr. Dreyer, who is also a sergeant first class with the New Jersey State Police, as tornado warnings went off in the background. “When it comes down from the mountains, it’s all gravity. It’s going to be much faster and more dangerous.” Several deaths have been reported Continue reading the main story","Fierce rains were likely to produce “catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the National Hurricane Center said.",2018-09-15T09:45:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence Live Updates: Heavy Rains Drenching the Carolinas,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/us/hurricane-florence-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664-facebookJumbo-v33.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-1,1
George Dvorsky,"Using a computer powered by an off-the-shelf Intel Core i5-6600 processor, a FedEx employee from Tennessee has discovered the largest prime number known to humanity. At 23,249,425 digits long, it’s nearly a million digits longer than the previous record holder. For those of you who failed or have long forgotten grade 3 math class, a prime number is any number that can only be divided by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.). It’s a freaky quirk of the Universe that has captivated mathematicians for centuries, as their appearance in the roll call of all integers defies prediction ( though biases have been detected in the distribution of consecutive primes ). Finding prime numbers thus requires a bit of trial-and-error, patience, and a lot of computing power. The new record-holding prime number, dubbed “M77232917,” was discovered by Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, on December 26, 2017. It was discovered as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a group that does exactly what its name implies. Mersenne primes—named after the 17th century French monk Marin Mersenne—are a rare class of primes that are one integer less than a number that’s been multiplied by itself, expressed as M n =2 n -1. In this case, the new prime was calculated by multiplying 77,232,917 by 77,232,917 and then subtracting one (2 77,232,917 -1). The new prime is the 50th known Mersenne prime. M77232917 contains 23,249,425 digits, which is practically impossible for the human brain to comprehend. You can download a zip file of the number here, which busts open into a simple text file nearly 24 MB in size. Here’s an itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny glimpse of the first few digits of the number: 467333183359231099988335585561115521251321102817714495798582338593567923480521177207484311099740208849621368090038049317248367442513519144365249220286787499224923639633038619305951170770522850356011779638644050954128274109548519743273551014325753249976993808191641040774990607027085131780854431482719287927051574760059182501122426493901177524147020112211388180246357120385256971031180861489618892584067750976814954567907442159253928086043451513107052318572800622535173305043931545049276946896285268869674944342112985792233732337801754241421827174125670264416644353313890442672256181107628062641550510992384203991225537857049225867450478199850186985188395719963008038717965906943698446227245769048442624077040456516926390008651726462990593760595429486791654633562139216744557672746497884434353520456556797052450980481438931349795938877105350614496693489409255155953306872814733490045565082856578190868933327141046378794972655266893887595979641316331028806592177529769834152124115913323365268166706644473143310974520823513974885636253719301950406605722095718079173467784212323941225708492276162678848504240175619575042958633387070067162448853074807881260125089824549619209919961134580250514604063519606634978181198613503051581163463555633566319896615827604388690329796011984096270537383579630874681056843649818067678103424096859574594387122476571828072557344394780380024201783548667495179746696190843622986643959450031252516686566594252074345358101581042723707992427571828820948849065861590065859074391377828173034683701925114789618787309101887004289046129873028746416386957443644028588809312429908860884297613860386816910586542216739001402734982971907272987483662107236827512472738409809578930670626153249685719278922751692157130896802807496462527584643633045876649970923366331569812027362273631245871521356011614860439988085178768763757860732625585115457092087848043258257876286498706458088135038948822247351807130888403164645794446319243717913259933477001220994458815795663730102285010141814663265537150923894600650386095599714691658518044760943228485293103850039495787904594766307709643249139518714435912361386106141359015789488893140142052513122486651646114701666701676143140750087224603889234655205528086110973730635187042131130393016253362794058251836128055518549678930658366455272915511811952058888392595313861166137697724678782720586680474567342842176857469092018559835324800004598444782456084485904576297338813661199170205858652099033435737405594286587479579072034591348880491778480562894857788046177321792968258171597503720079791566992083055824866579012557180722751078462924794248439652077467237403658550061799279956704411031254567465451105499362798947781210188466981867175415780089815289984924792655784203471522023573618649847743212240495339397953595778060553510296261735673554034489108685389266344608133903535814448582274184496823988891485433908407138755118440965780608756502239030483891349117815030583034147983474364473410786162232983781676844315610390028354503758000566280031377558992067117024880997033717503400673301922738074511864300037419291160271133918403435581992793701952141372100135595457599485254674121618690682674413645774237169049255424728665357996103997069776243968010876776475830443576635739972027953438424843103674054245431824410173440025375378765370235220916664367509996157398715673180804853549565098667607871303308044944405283848532769455954881164266322865068561846182186079278726212101078949803932341590437977436216839406044542808714268030063768857675412060494935032858614372477002463478278523399030686898768798513296184049579718910789231320899515797161738788846785311885... You get the point. According to GIMP, that’s big enough to fill an entire shelf of books totalling 9,000 pages. Or put another way, “If every second you were to write five digits to an inch then 54 days later you’d have a number stretching over 73 miles (118 km)—almost 3 miles (5 km) longer than the previous record prime,” writes GIMP. Pace, a long-time math enthusiast and a current employee at FedEx, does charity work as a SysAdmin, running Prime95 on all his PCs and servers; Pace is one of thousands of volunteers who are using free GIMPS software in the effort to continually find larger and larger prime numbers. The PC that Pace used to find the prime number required six straight days of computation on a quad-core Intel i5-6600 CPU to verify it. Indeed, the discovery of new primes is no small task; every candidate prime must go through the time-consuming and rigorous process of being cut-up by any potential divisors. Once a candidate prime is discovered, it has to be verified by outside sources. In this case, the prime was independently verified by four different programs running on different hardware configurations: Aaron Blosser verified it using Prime95 on an Intel Xeon server in 37 hours. David Stanfill verified it using gpuOwL on an AMD RX Vega 64 GPU in 34 hours Andreas Höglund verified the prime using CUDALucas running on NVidia Titan Black GPU in 73 hours Ernst Mayer also verified it using his own program Mlucas on 32-core Xeon server in 82 hours. Andreas Höglund also confirmed using Mlucas running on an Amazon AWS instance in 65 hours. The quest to find more prime numbers may seem frivolous, but they hold practical applications as well, such as the generation of public key cryptography algorithms, hash tables, and as random number generators. Further work into primes could also tell us a bit more about mathematics and why it’s so damned good at describing the universe. And as Carl Sagan speculated in Cosmos, transmitting streams of consecutive primes could also be used as a way of saying “hello” to an alien civilization. As exciting as this discovery is, the Holy Grail of primes is yet to be found: a prime number containing 100 million digits. The first person to find this elusive number will be awarded $150,000 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Good luck!

Devin Coldewey,"It’s finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy’s first mission, and SpaceX’s heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time. The launch will take a major communications satellite into orbit, and as an encore all three of the first stages will attempt to return to Earth and make soft landings. Success means the inauguration of a new era in spaceflight.
Falcon Heavy was first tested last February, with a dummy payload of a Tesla Roadster and a mannequin dubbed “Starman,” now somewhere past the orbit of Mars. Since then the rocket has gained a few improvements, including a reinforced center core that should help enable it to return safely.
In addition to taking an enormous satellite to orbit, SpaceX will be attempting to recover all three first stages and the fairing that covers the payload as well. The side stages will be guiding themselves to Landing Zone 1 and 2 nearby the launch complex, while the center core, having traveled much further, will land on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship Of Course I Still Love You. Other boats will attempt to catch both pieces of the falling fairing.
It bears mentioning here that not only are there essentially no launch vehicles in Falcon Heavy’s class, but certainly none that can autonomously return to Earth and be used again. SpaceX is very far out ahead of the competition here, though the next few years will see new entrants in the field. But this will be a first for several reasons.
The 230-foot assembly, all brand new rockets (rather than reused), is currently standing up at Launch Complex 39A, the site of many historic launches, from Apollo to Space Shuttle. T-0 is this evening at 6:35 local time in Cape Canaveral. You can watch it live below or at the SpaceX webcast site.
The important events we’ll be on the watch for will occur roughly as follows, in approximate minutes and seconds after takeoff:
1:09 after launch: Max-Q, the point at which the launch vehicle is under the most strain. As reliable as rockets have become, every launch is a white-knuckler until after this point.
2:30: BECO, or booster engine cutoff, when the side cores shut off and detach.
3:31: MECO, or main engine cutoff, when the central core shuts down and detaches from the second stage, which ignites a few seconds afterwards. The fairings will detach about 30 seconds later.
7:51: Side cores descend at LZ for landing.
8:48: Second stage first burn concludes and cruise phase begins.
9:48: Main core descends at drone ship for landing.
???: Fairing descends over ocean to be caught. Timing is unclear on this, but it probably will be a few minutes after the main core lands.
27:34: Second stage second burn begins, lasting 1:26.
34:02: Arabsat-6A detaches from launch vehicle and continues under its own power. At this point SpaceX will have completed its mission, though it will take some time for the satellite to arrive at its geosynchronous orbit.
We’ll be watching too, and will update this post with any relevant new info.","It's finally launch day for the Falcon Heavy's first mission, and SpaceX's heavy-duty rocket platform is due to take off at 3:35 Pacific time.

Andrew Krok,"Plug-in hybrids have been making some steady gains in EV range as battery and motor tech improves. To that end, Mercedes-Benz's newest plug-in hybrid could sport some impressive electric-only range. The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class plug-in hybrid is aiming for a 62-mile (100-kilometer) EV range, Automotive News reports, citing an interview with Ola Källenius, head of Mercedes-Benz R&amp;D and the successor to current Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche. It would be the first combustion-engine vehicle to offer such a range -- most vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz's current PHEVs, target a 31-mile (50-km) range, which is the minimum required to count toward an upcoming EV-credit program in China, currently the market hungriest for electrified vehicles. The GLE-Class also grew a third row for the 2020 model year, because the small-planet-sized GLS-Class isn't for everyone. Steven Ewing/Roadshow Don't get too hung up on that single number, though. Källenius told Automotive News that this range estimate is by Europe's new WLTP testing standard. While it's closer to the figures that the EPA puts together in the US, there's still a disparity between the two, with EPA measurements usually coming in below WLTP estimates. But still, even if the EPA-estimated range is 50 miles, it's still a commendable figure. It might hold the crown when it goes on sale, but that reign may not last very long. As Automotive News notes, BMW is working on a 100-km system for its plug-in hybrids, as well, and it's expected to debut before 2020. There's also the matter of the Polestar 1, a 600-plus-horsepower PHEV that it believed to have a range closer to 90 miles. But with a MSRP of $155,000, it's not exactly on the same playing field (or even playing the same sport) as the GLE. Some GLE-Class variants that aren't plug-in hybrids will still benefit from electrification. When the 2020 GLE-Class debuted, Mercedes-Benz announced that the GLE350 4Matic will wield its new EQ Boost 48-volt mild hybrid system, which improves both performance and efficiency, depending on how it's used. The new Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is expected to go on sale next year. 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class : See what else Mercedes has in store for the new GLE. 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class : Electrification is everywhere, and it's not just for efficiency anymore.","Even if the EPA rates it lower, that range is still remarkable.",2018-10-12T15:18:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Mercedes GLE-Class plug-in hybrid could rock 62 miles of EV range - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/mercedes-gle-class-plug-in-hybrid-range-report/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/hUg-mSXPLetS0Nd0486bR7ZVpms=/2018/10/02/9ed4a5f7-c521-438d-99ad-5a57e7ea3a71/mercedes-gle-gallery-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,class-1,1

Janaki Jitchotvisut,"If you travel frequently for business, you've probably wished for the convenience and luxury of a private jet at least once. The allure of ample legroom, gourmet meals, and top-flight spirits — along with strong WiFi — is powerful in the extreme. Now imagine you could have an experience like this — but at prices closer to what you'd pay for first-class commercial aviation. That's the experience that Aura plans to launch in 2019. Initially, flights will go between six major US cities: NYC, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Denver, and Los Angeles. Aura is using specially redesigned Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft to seat just 29 passengers per flight — 21 in the lower-tier First class and just eight in the higher tier Wave class. They're streamlining the airport experience. Aura is contracting with private airports in the cities it serves — which will translate to passengers needing to arrive a mere 20 minutes before boarding. If you're a frequent air traveler, the time savings alone could be worth it to you. Aura has two ticket tiers. The seats in First allow plenty of room to stretch. AURA Currently, Aura plans to launch with both member and non-member pricing schemes — and like any similar service, subscribers will pay less for tickets. Subscribers — known as Keyholders — will pay $100 per month, which allows unlimited flight access at fixed fares that are, at most, half the cost of what non-subscribers will pay. Since non-member flight prices will fluctuate with demand, Keyholders may actually pay less than half that price. The First seats fully recline, too. Fly Aura Customers purchasing seats in First will find an experience similar to first class on a commercial flight — only on a smaller, more luxurious plane. Seats are placed in a 2 to 1 configuration with legroom at a 44 inch pitch. If that's not luxe enough, Wave class will allow you to fully recline on special AÏANAWAVE zero-gravity seats that were designed in consultation with sleep psychologists and aero-medical scientists. Food, drink, and other amenities will give you a sense of home while flying A seasonal rotating menu of what Aura calls ""fusion tapas"" and sushi will be available to all passengers. A full bar including both soft and alcoholic beverages will also be available to all passengers. There are plenty of amenities. AURA Wave class passengers will also have full dining service available from Aura's Meatlocker. This service allows passengers to choose their protein and have it cooked to their exact specifications sous-vide by a chef on the plane — and the proteins are fresh, never frozen. All passengers can access high-speed WiFi — and also use a provided iPad Pro in-flight if you like. Additional flight schedules to events like Coachella, Sundance, and Art Basel are planned — as well as ski destinations including Aspen and Vail when seasonally appropriate. Aura intends to publish flight schedules 90 days in advance. Pricing varies depending on the flight route. If you're an Aura Keyholder, a one-way flight between Chicago and Atlanta starts at $280 for First class and $600 for Wave class. That same flight will cost at least $560 for First class and at least $1200 for Wave class for the general public, without a subscription — and those fares may increase at any time if you aren't a Keyholder.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips of our favorite experts. This week, we’re going behind the scenes at Lifehacker. I’m Alicia Adamczyk, and this is how I work. Location: New York City Current Gig: Staff writer, Lifehacker Current mobile device: iPhone 7 Current computer: Macbook Air One word that best describes how you work: Evolving First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. As a young Michigander with too much time on her hands, I declared myself the neighborhood reporter and walked around with a notebook, interviewing my friends after roller hockey games. I never actually wrote any articles, but I did take those reporting skills with me to the college paper at the University of Michigan, where my writing was, in fact, published and occasionally read by people other than my parents. Reporting and writing was always the dream, and I never really had a backup (for any aspiring writers: I recommend having a backup). I landed an internship at Forbes during my senior year, so I moved to NYC after graduation and have been here since. Take us through a recent workday. My work days are pretty standard: I usually get into the office around 8:30 a.m. and read emails, go through Feedly and scan Reddit and other sites I’ve bookmarked for story ideas. I have a long list of evergreens I might pull from, or tackle the news of the day, depending. Being in the office with no one else around helps me focus, structure my day and get my to-do lists in order. I’ll also never skip breakfast: usually a bagel with cream cheese and tomato, though I occasionally eat something healthy. I like to schedule any interviews I have in the morning if I can help it, and then I’ll write my morning story. I’m very much of the mind that you should knock out your “hardest” and/or most tedious tasks first, so I try to do all of that first thing, and around noon or 1 p.m. I’ll break for lunch and a walk. After that, I’ll write my afternoon story and prep longer-term/reported stories for future days. I usually leave around 6 p.m., or a bit earlier if I have a workout class. What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without? There are so many! My number one is a journal. Nothing beats handwriting your notes and thoughts in the moment. I carry it everywhere. That said, I use Microsoft OneNote to keep track of pretty much everything electronically (it’s also where I house my to-do lists, shopping lists, etc. So many lists). The program itself can be a bit slow but I like it more than any comparable service I’ve tried. AirPods are my newest favorite toy—they’re a bit scifi-y but they’re much more suitable for commuting and running than my older earphones, and I have a pair of decent over-ear, noise-cancelling headphones when I want to tune everyone out. I listen to my own pre-made playlists on Spotify Premium (which is worth every penny) and I use the Overcast app for podcasts. The final “gadget” I need is a water bottle. I drink a bottle of water while I’m getting ready for work, a few throughout the day, and more when I get home. Gotta stay hydrated! What’s your workspace setup like? In our office I have a pretty basic setup at the communal desk: laptop, books, water bottle, small plant. I got rid of my standing desk because I never used it and it took up too much of the small amount of space that I had. I also need to switch my seat up once or twice a day to focus, so I’ll move to one of the privacy rooms or the phone booths we have, or a coffee shop. For that reason, I prefer interviewing people from my tiny NYC studio rather than in the office, though that can’t always be helped. If I’m working from home I like to spread out, which means working on the ground on my yoga mat or walking up and down the hallway. Occasionally I’ll work from my couch or bed, with an old laptop playing HGTV for some background noise. What’s your best shortcut or life hack? Automate as much as you can so you can spend time on and enjoy the things that you really care about. A second: Put your phone in airplane mode. At work, at home, at yoga—just do it. If you have nothing pressing to worry about (or kids, I would imagine), give yourself a break! Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work. Nothing too finicky or unusual, except that if everything isn’t organized—for example, emails read, Feedly lists combed through, two stories for the day selected—my thoughts will jump to everything else I need to do instead of engaging with a single task. So I like to get all of that addressed first thing in the morning. Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them? My friends and family continually inspire and encourage me, I feel very lucky for all of them. More generally, our readers, because that’s who we’re all doing this for, and my coworkers, who are so kind, smart and creative. How do you keep track of what you have to do? I use Microsoft OneNote for pretty much everything, and a reporter’s notepad specifically for daily work tasks, reminders and meeting notes. We use Trello to track all of our stories, so I rely on that quite a bit, and I have a Google doc of stories and general topics I’d like to address at some point, as well as potential sources. I’m also big on Post-its for reminders. How do you recharge or take a break? As I mentioned, I take walks fairly regularly. Even if it’s just a circle around the office, it helps me get out of one mindset (or attitude, as Caroline Bingley would say) and ready for something else. I’ll also call my dad or scroll through Instagram or Tumblr, to get some types of stimuli outside of Twitter and the news. Outside of work, running, spin class, cooking, watching 30 Rock or taking an afternoon/day to myself to do nothing helps me recharge. What’s your favorite side project? Currently, it’s my money newsletter, though I’m working on a new writing project (not money related) that I’m excited about! What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend? The best book I read recently was Educated by Tara Westover, and I’m currently reading Debt: The First 5,000 Years by David Graeber, a book so long I expect to be reading it for the next 5,000 years. Who else would you like to see answer these questions? Karen and Georgia from the My Favorite Murder podcast! They have so many projects going on at one time. And Ann Friedman, who seems to have the freelance life figured out. What’s the best advice you’ve ever received? It’s not necessarily “advice” in the traditional sense, but, “You’re doing ok.” It’s good to remind yourself sometimes that you’re doing just fine, that you’re where you need to be, and that the best things take time. What’s a problem you’re still trying to solve? There are so many. In terms of being a personal finance writer, it’s making money topics approachable and interesting to as wide a range of people as possible while still providing solid advice, especially to those who need it most. I doubt I’ll ever crack it completely, but I’m trying.","Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips of our favorite experts.

PTI,"In-form Australian pacer Pat Cummins on Tuesday could not help but praise another fast bowler on the top of his game - Jasprit Bumrah, saying the Indian’s pace and accuracy has made him a serious threat in all three formats. Cummins has been Australia’s standout fast bowler over the last 12 months and has even made some useful contributions with the bat, including in the first T20 against India in Vizag on Sunday, when he got a crucial four and a double on the final two balls to pull off a three wicket win for his team. Bumrah, on the other hand, brought back India into the game by taking two wickets in the 19th over in which he conceded just two runs. In his comeback game, he showed how invaluable he has become for India in all three formats.
“He is obviously a class act. Two of the basics he does really well is that he bowls fast and he bowls accurately. Anyone who does that in world cricket will pose a real challenge for the batsmen. He has got a great slower ball, seems to have a great cricketing brain, executes his skills really well,” Cummins said.
“He has done really well in all three formats and the one to watch out for,added the Auusie speedster ahead of the second and final T20 here Wednesday.

The 25-year-old from Sydney himself has become invaluable for his team after maintaining his fitness over the past two seasons. He did well in the home Test series against India though the hosts lost before blowing away Sri Lanka.
“I haven’t seen too many memes (of myself on social media) but really happy with how my game is going at the moment. So many things have fallen into place. Playing quite consistent cricket has helped,” Cummins said.
“I have not played too much white ball cricket, so looking forward to more of it. It is a bigger challenge with the ball not swinging as much as the red ball.” He has also been involved with some tense finishes including the one in the last game. Though he doesn’t consider himself as a proper batsman yet, Cummins relishes the challenge of closing out games.
“I am pretty happy batting down at 8 or 9. I think my role in the team is just to survive and bat extra time. Hopefully, I have got a batsman at the other end who can really cash in, especially in Tests. I might have big shots like a lot of other batsmen, and I have really enjoyed it,” he said.

“Anyway, you can’t just prepare for a game as a bowler, you got to prepare for everything.” Talking about thriving in tense moments, Cummins said: “You play international sport because you want to be in moments where you can win a game. T20 is a great format, almost feels like every second or third, you are either in a position to win a game or the game is on the line.
“A lot of players off the field get terribly nervous watching but once you are out on the field, you know you are in control, you have done that in the past. I am more relaxed when I am out there, when I am in the moment.” Australia are a game away from a series win in India and if that happens, “it will be a huge result”, feels Cummins.
“It (leading a series) has not happened for us in a while in an overseas series. Especially in a place like India which is so foreign to Australian conditions, against one of the best sides in the world. It will be a huge result for us, yeah. But we know will have to really play well to beat them tomorrow.” Cummins loved the bowler friendly conditions in Vizag but is expecting more runs from the surface at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.
“It has been a funny wicket in the last couple of years. First time I came to Bangalore 7-8 years ago during the IPL, it was a 220 wicket. Over the years, it has slowed down,” he said.
“Vizag was low scoring but a great game. Loved the surface there. In T20s you prepare for yorkers, slower balls, but over there you knew good balls were going to be good enough. The ball felt like swinging a little bit in the end,” he added.

JIM TANKERSLEY and BEN CASSELMAN,"Those losses included a drubbing in the districts where the SALT deduction is most heavily claimed. Democrats won 10 of the 20 Republican-held districts where the largest proportion of taxpayers claim the deduction, including seats in California, Virginia and New Jersey. Some Democratic challengers in those districts criticized the SALT limit on the campaign trail. Still, there is little evidence to suggest that SALT alone tipped those districts toward Democrats, who largely focused on health care in their policy pitch to voters. The SALT provision appears to have gone largely unmentioned in Democratic attack ads: Researchers at the Wesleyan Media Project compiled a full report on mentions of tax issues in House campaigns, and SALT did not appear anywhere in their findings. Democrats dont have much chance of repealing the cap in the next two years, because Republicans still hold the Senate and the White House. Even if they controlled the whole government, Democrats might struggle to repeal the caps because they would be, in effect, reversing a tax increase on well-off Americans. Simply reinstating the unlimited cap, without also reversing the changes to the alternative minimum tax, would deliver no benefit to low-income and middle-class Americans, according to a new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank. More than 85 percent of the benefits would go to the top 5 percent of American income earners. The top 1 percent of income earners would see an average tax cut of $35,000 each. That math may be difficult to sell to a Democratic base that spent the past year calling the Trump tax cuts a giveaway to the rich.",President Trump signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut into law last December.

Any successful TV series soon spawns one or two others that are of suspect quality and have a vague connection to the original.

Udaloy-class vessels carried two 100mm guns, two quad SS-N-14 Silex launchers, 64 SA-N-9 Gauntlet point-defense surface-to-air missiles in eight eight-round launchers, four quad 53mm torpedo tube mounts, and four AK-630 close-in weapon systems. The destroyer could also operate two Ka-27 Helix anti-ship helicopters. That's some serious firepower — a submarine captain would have some trepidation having to take those on. But the Udaloy was a little weak in one crucial area: fighting surface ships. The SS-N-14 and the 533mm torpedoes could be used against ships, but they were primarily intended to hunt subs. In short, the Udaloy was out-ranged by the RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, which was in service with U.S. Navy three years before the first Udaloy was commissioned. So, in 1989, the Soviet Union laid down what they hoped would be the answer to this shortcoming. Despite plans to build several, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union would leave this vessel as the only one of its kind. The Admiral Chabanenko underwent a lengthy construction process — it took ten years to be commissioned. For this ship, the Soviets turned to the Udaloy's contemporary, the Sovremennyy, as a baseline. The Admiral Chabanenko replaced the two 100mm guns with a twin 130mm gun mount, the quad SS-N-14 mounts were replaced with quad SS-N-22 Sunburn launchers, and the four AK-630s were replaced with CADS-N-1 close-in weapon systems. Today, this unique vessel is still in service with the Russian Navy. Two planned sister ships were never finished.

Jess Joho,"Season 1 of The Handmaid's Tale left viewers in total suspense, with a final shot of Offred gliding away from the camera and into the darkness of a van promising an unknown future. Season 2's April premiere is still far away, but new photos released by Hulu show off more of the show's gorgeous cinematography, finding vibrant beauty in the bleakest of worlds. SEE ALSO: 2017 was the year women took back their own narratives If anyone wondered why Handmaid's Tale has been sweeping at every awards show — taking home almost everything it was nominated for at the Emmys, Golden Globes, and Critics' Choice awards — then here's definitive proof that you need to pay attention to this show. Details on the plot for the upcoming season are hard to predict, since we're in largely uncharted territory when it comes to Margaret Atwood's original source material. But we can glean a few things, with the new photos depicting imagery that feels both new and hauntingly familiar. The illusions to religious imagery is only getting sharper Image: TAKE FIVE/Hulu One reveals what we can only assume are ""The Colonies"" often referenced to in Season 1, as the horrible place that troublemakers in Gilead's society get taken. What happens in ""The Colonies?"" Even the citizen's of Gilead only have rumors, so we'll have to wait and see. Elizabeth Moss' Offred (or June) — who ended the last season discovering she was pregnant — can be seen giving a steely look while covered in blood. Judging from all of last season's cutaways to sharp objects and Offred's growing need for violence, we imagine she'll only become more radicalized in Season 2. Offred is in red again, but not the kind we're used to seeing Image: Take Five/Hulu Another shot shows a line of women that appear much like the Handmaids, but dressed in black garb and red masks that cover their face — a stark contrast to the strict red and white dress code that previously signified their status in Gilead's society. Is this a new look for the handmaids — or a totally new, different class? Image: Take five/Hulu Well, leave it to Handmaid's Tale to speak volumes with only a few powerful, poignant images. Consider us loyal soldiers of the Handmaid Army, waiting at the ready to join the May Day rebellion the minute Season 2 hits Hulu on April 26.","Season 1 of The Handmaid's Tale left viewers in total suspense, with a final shot of Offred gliding away from the camera and into the darkness of a van promising an unknown future.

Stefan Etienne,"The way it should be done Dell’s latest 15-inch XPS 2-in-1 is a high-end laptop that appeals to creative users: people who need power and portability, and might also appreciate a touchscreen and a stylus. It plays in the same field as HP’s Spectre x360 15, Microsoft’s Surface Book 2, and Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Pro. Right out of the box, Dell gets most things right with the XPS 15 2-in-1, with a just few areas that need improvement. Its build quality, attention to detail, power, and flexibility add up to a high-end experience that matches its premium price. It’s fair to say you get what you pay for with the XPS 15 2-in-1. It starts at $1,299, but the model I’ve been testing costs nearly a grand more at $2,199. That price gets a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB of storage, a 4K touchscreen, and AMD’s integrated Radeon Vega M graphics. The most costly part of that is the 4K screen, so you can save quite a bit by opting for the 1080p panel. No matter which model you buy, the Vega M graphics come along for the ride. It’s a solid package that I’ve been able to live and work with — mostly in harmony. Looking at the XPS 15 2-in-1’s chassis is well, an unimpressive viewing — Dell’s XPS laptops have been using the same basic design language for years now and it looks dated. Most of the laptop is covered in metal topped with a silver finish, and when opened up, a faux carbon fiber palm rest. It has a rubberized, smooth texture that makes it by far one of the most comfortable palm rests I’ve used and despite being prone to fingerprints, it’s easy to clean. Dell’s build quality is unmatched Overall, the design might be boring, but the XPS makes up for that with excellent build quality. The palm rest, display, touchpad, and keyboard hardly exhibit any noticeable give — there are no wobbly underside or clicking fans here. However, the Dell XPS 2-in-1 isn’t a lightweight, weighing in at almost 4.5 pounds. That’s more than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, Surface Book 2, and even some full-fledged gaming laptops. I don’t think anyone wants to walk around with a four-plus pound tablet, because it’s cumbersome and awkward to use, but since the XPS is a convertible, you can do that if you want. No one wants a four pound tablet The 360-degree hinge also lets you use the XPS in an easel or movie-watching mode, both of which are probably more practical than as a tablet. The hinge is quite sturdy and doesn’t have the horrible screen wobble so many 2-in-1s are plagued by. On the flip side, it’s very hard to open the XPS 15 2-in-1 with one hand, thanks to that stiff hinge and no cut out to slip your finger into. When it comes to ports, the XPS 2-in-1 reminds me of the not-so-loved 15-inch MacBook Pro: two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB-C 3.1 ports with DisplayPort, an audio jack, microSD card slot (I’m not sure what to do with it), lock slot, and a battery level indicator. There’s no full-size USB-A port — which is a travesty — and while I appreciate the forward-thinking of including USB-C, user adoption still isn’t high enough for me to swear it off, then have to buy a dongle. Dell does get your dongle collection started by including a USB-C to A adapter in the box, but I’d much rather just have the port built into the machine itself. Fortunately, you can charge the laptop using any one of the four USB-C ports. The screen on the Dell measures 15.6 inches (with a 16:9 ratio), has thin bezels, and supports Dell’s included stylus. It’s the highlight of this XPS 15 2-in-1 unit, because this 4K display pops. By default, Dell sets Windows 10’s display scaling to 250 percent, which makes everything comically large — moving it down to something like 225 or 200 percent lets you better take advantage of the screen’s real estate. It’s a gorgeous 4K screen Colors are bright, with tons of pop and contrast without too much image sharpening. The 4K option has 100 precent Adobe RGB certification (with some variance between displays), which is useful if you’re planning to do any serious image editing with it. Dell advertises 400 nits of brightness and while eyeballing it next to the Spectre 15-inch x360, the Dell definitely appears to be the brighter and better looking 4K experience. Dell deserves credit for including a capable stylus with the XPS 15 2-in-1, unlike HP, which throws in a basic one, or Microsoft that doesn’t give you any stylus at all. The included pen has 4,096 levels of pressure and is the closest equivalent to the Surface Pen I’ve tested. It’s a great stylus, has good weighting, and draws with precision. It also supports angle input for shading. The XPS 15 2-in-1’s keyboard is nearly as shallow as the MacBook Pro 15-inch, but other than that, there isn’t anything like it. It’s clickier, has better tactile response, and I find it more enjoyable to type on, overall. Also, it’s hopefully more reliable than Apple’s issue-prone keyboard. However, the backlight brightness is not as bright as I hoped and the Page Up and Page Down keys are unceremoniously located above the left and right directional keys — it’s just asking for an incorrect entry. Shallow keys, but they’re okay The trackpad is Precision-enabled, but is a tad small considering the overall real estate on the palm rest. Regardless, it has a fast, accurate input with support for all of Windows 10’s gestures, and the results are exactly what I look for: smooth. Dell makes it very easy to log in to the computer by supporting both fingerprint sign-in — via the power button — and facial recognition via the IR camera, located at the bottom of the display, under the “Dell” logo. The webcam placement is a sacrifice made for the thin bezel design, but as I’ve found out before ( and more than once ) it’s entirely possible to have thin bezels and place the webcam where it belongs — at the top of the screen. It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again: Dell’s camera placement means that all of your video calls will have horribly unflattering up-the-nose angles and your fingers will block the camera when you type. “This Dell rips,” are words that I’d rarely ever say, but they are true about this XPS 15 2-in-1. Processor-wise, the Core i7-8750G is a speedy quad-core processor — that part is well-known — but there is little (if any) crapware installed upon first booting the XPS 15 2-in-1. So your first few times using the system is clear-headed and uncluttered, as it should be. Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, and other Adobe suite apps should have no issue running in large batch operations here. Didn’t expect light gaming performance Where the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me in terms of performance was with graphically intensive apps, or rather, games. League of Legends can run at a consistent 60 fps and full 4K resolution. Counter Strike: Global Offensive runs just as well, but a graphics-intense title like Rainbow Six: Siege requires some settings tweaks, to a lower resolution with less eye candy. It won’t hold a candle next to a purpose-built gaming laptop, but it’s still impressive because the XPS 15 2-in-1 wasn’t designed for gaming to being with. I’m used to seeing just five hours of battery life with 2-in-1 computers that have 4K touchscreens, but the XPS 15 2-in-1 surprised me with seven hours of use between charges. It’s not as long as you’ll get with an ultrabook or Microsoft’s Surface Book 2, but it’s on par with the 15-inch MacBook Pro and other powerful laptops. The light-up battery gauge on the left side offers limited info as to how much battery is left, but it is useful for eyeballing it. Dell has established the XPS 15 2-in-1 as one of the best laptops in its class. The XPS 15 2-in-1 blends all the benefits of having a 4K display, powerful chipset, and aesthetic integrity, without the user having to sacrifice too much battery life, excessive heat, or poor build quality. While the design choices of Dell still seem a bit dated, everything else about the XPS 15 2-in-1 performs as you’d expect… which is the right way. The 4K screen is an expensive upgrade The biggest issue might be the XPS 15 2-in-1’s price, which isn’t as high as a MacBook Pro or Surface Book 2, but still a significant cost. You can skip the 4K screen for a 1080 panel and save quite a few hundred dollars, while still maintaining many of the other qualities that make this XPS so good to use. You might even get better battery life and performance with the lower-resolution screen, but 4K just makes it that much better because of the Adobe RGB support and resolution. Although the XPS 15 2-in-1 is a very expensive laptop with a boring design, it does most everything it’s supposed to well, which might be enough to make you forget about its cost and sleepy styling.

Anthony Ha,"While it may not have the name recognition of some other live TV streaming services, fuboTV says it’s been growing quickly it was “approaching” 250,000 paid subscribers in September, more than doubling the 100,000 subscribers it had a year ago. For the entire third quarter, fuboTV says it saw a net addition of 30,000 subscribers. The company is also sharing details about its revenue, with an annualized revenue rate run rate of $102 million in September 2018, compared to $28 million September 2017. Plus, time spent per subscriber has grown 364 percent, to 51 hours. The service first launched in 2015 as a soccer-focused streaming service, but it has expanded so that it’s not just offering live games from the NFL, MLB, NCAA, NBA and many others, but also carrying networks like AMC, CBS, NBC and FX. Co-founder and CEO David Gandler said it’s now “a sports-first cable replacement product.” “People come in through the sports and they stay for the entertainment,” he said. Gandler acknowledged that there’s one big, missing piece ESPN. But he added, “As a startup, we obviously are talking to everybody … At some point in time, when it makes sense for both sides, that deal will come to fruition.” Competing services have been making growth announcements with bigger numbers Dish’s Sling TV and AT&amp;T’s DirecTV now seem to be in competition for the top spot, while Hulu’s live TV service recently topped 1 million subscribers. However, Gandler said fuboTV is doing quite well “relative to our brand penetration” in other words, when you compare how many people have heard of Sling or DirecTV, versus how many people have heard of fuboTV, the startup’s numbers are “just remarkable.” He also argued that fuboTV has been punching above its weight class in other ways. With a team of fewer than 150 employees, “We built a cable platform in 18 to 24 months,” he said. It hasn’t experienced significant downtime, it recently launched a live recommendations product and this summer, it was the first live TV streaming service to launch a 4K HDR feature in a beta program that included NCAA college football, MLB playoffs and English Premier League soccer. “Were as a small startup, but we execute very well,” Gandler said. “The reason why, I believe, is that this is our only product. It’s not being used to sell other products. We have to be very good at what we do.”","While it may not have the name recognition of some other live TV streaming services, fuboTV says it’s been growing quickly — it was “approaching” 250,000 paid subscribers in September, more than doubling the 100,000 subscribers it had a year ago.

Catherine Shu,"A federal judge denied Teslas motion to dismiss charges in a lawsuit claiming that it mistreated foreign workers. This means the automaker will have to defend itself at trial against allegations that foreign workers at its Fremont factory worked shifts that violated forced labor laws and were threatened with deportation if they reported injuries. The ruling comes just a few days after Elon Musk agreed to resign as Teslas chairman (while staying on as its CEO) to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC filed a complaint in federal district court last week charging Musk with fraud related to his tweets in August that he planned to take Tesla private at $420 a share. In a ruling made on Monday, Judge Lucy Koh of California Northern District Court in San Jose dismissed five out of seven claims in the lawsuit, Lesnik v. Eisenmann SE (case number 5:16-cv-01120), and denied motions to dismiss from Tesla subcontractors Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem. Other vehicle makers (Mercedes-Benz, Deere, REHAU, LaX, Volkswagen, Dicastal, and BMW) were also named as defendants, but dismissed because they arent included in the two claims that will go to trial. The class action lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Gregor Lesnik, from Slovenia, and Stjepan Papes, from Croatia, on behalf of foreign workers covered by B-1 visas. Both Lesnik and Papes were hired by ISM Vuzem and sent to the U.S. to work at Teslas Fremont facility. The suit alleges that foreign workers were paid far below minimum wage and worked extreme hours. Lesnik claims that he typically worked 12 hours a day and never less than 10 hours, over 80 hours a week, adding up to more than 240 hours a month, but only received one day off every two weeks, in violation of forced labor laws. When Lesnik was too sick to work or reported a job injury, the suit alleges Vuzem threatened to withhold pay or visa and immigration benefits. Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann are not liable for abuses by ISM Vuzem because they benefitted financially. Teslas auto manufacturing plant in Fremont was scrutinized last year after complaints by employee Jose Moran, which were denied by CEO Elon Musk in a staff email. Earlier this year, Californias Division of Occupational Safety and Health said it would look into conditions at the factory after R eveal reported that Tesla did not accurately report work injuries, as required by state and federal law (charges Tesla also denied ). While its labor and safety practices were being criticized, other workers also filed several lawsuits alleging racial discrimination and harassment at the Fremont plant.

Frederic Lardinois,"Google today launched version 1.2 of its Flutter cross-platform UI framework at MWC Barcelona. With this, Flutter now features support for Android App Bundles, Google’s latest technology for packaging Android apps more efficiently and for creating instant apps, too. In addition, the framework lays the groundwork for helping developers accept in-app payments and adds a number of new web-based tools, too.
It’s only been a couple of months since the Flutter team shipped version 1.0. In case you are wondering what happened to version 1.1: that was last month’s beta release and the team plans to ship roughly one 1.x update every month.
Unsurprisingly, this update comes with the usual stability and performance updates, as well as the latest Dart 2.2 SDK (by default, Flutter apps are written in Google’s Dart language), but the team also notes that it worked hard to improve iOS support, too, with support for floating cursor text editing, for example.
While Flutter always focused on mobile, the team also recently started talking about building desktop apps with the framework. To prepare for that, version 1.2 now features new keyboard events and mouse hover support. Project Hummingbird, the Flutter team’s project for bringing Flutter to the web, will also become available as a technical preview in the next few months.
As far as the new dev tools go, it’s worth noting that Google already built Flutter support into Android Studio and added tools for Microsoft’s increasingly popular Visual Studio Code. Now, it’s also building new web-based programming tools, the Dart DevTools. These run locally and include a widget inspector, a timeline view, a source-level debugger and a logging view.
For now, these tools are officially in preview and are available for installation alongside the existing VS Code and Android Studio extensions and add-ins.
“We plan to invest further in Dart DevTools as a first-class unified tool for Flutter developers, and as integration for web-based experiences improves, we plan to build these services directly into tools like Visual Studio Code,” the team notes in today’s updates.
In addition to today’s launch, the Flutter team also announced a new contest: Flutter Create, which challenges developers to build something “interesting, inspiring and beautiful” with Flutter using 5K or less of Dart code. Among the prizes is a $10,000 iMac Pro, which, at 128 GB of RAM, isn’t likely to struggle with that 5K code base.","Google today launched version 1.2 of its Flutter cross-platform UI framework at MWC Barcelona.

Kieran Corcoran,"All Souls College at Oxford University. Oli Scarff/Getty Images Faiz Siddiqui got a 2:1 from Oxford in 2000, which he claims is too low. Siddiqui said the grade amounts to a failure and harmed his career. He is suing Oxford in the High Court for £1 million in damages. A lawyer who says his career failed to live up to his full potential is suing Oxford University for not giving him a good enough grade. Faiz Siddiqui, a 39-year-old graduate of Brasenose College, Oxford, is currently fighting the university in Britain's High Court, where he hopes to extract £1 million ($1.32 million) in damages. According to The Times newspaper, Siddiqui's lawyer described his client's 2:1 grade (an ""upper second-class"" degree, one below a first-class) as an ""inexplicable failure"" which scuppered his career. At the opening of the trial, he claimed that inadequate teaching, and the university's failure to adjust for his poor health during exam season, led to him missing the first-class degree he would otherwise have achieved. The court reportedly heard that Siddiqui was offered a training contract with Clifford Chance, one of the top London law firms, after he graduated. He then worked for three other law firms, and later for EY, before being dismissed ""essentially for poor performance"" in 2011, since which time he has been unemployed. Siddiqui's lawyer reportedly said this fell significantly short of the career his client had hoped for: A postgrad degree from an Ivy League university followed by a high-flying legal career either in the UK or US. A lawyer for Oxford dismissed Siddiqui's alternative career trajectory as ""fanciful,"" The Times said, and maintains that he, not the university, was responsible for his lacklustre career. The university asked last year for his case to be struck down, but a judge ruled that a trial should take place. It is not clear how Siddiqui funded his degree, but standard undergraduate tuition in England when he was studying cost £1,000 a year, less than one ninth of current levels.","Faiz Siddiqui got a 2:1 from Oxford in 2000, which he claims is too low.

Brian Heater,"The road to consumer robots is littered with the remains of failed startups. Jibo and Kuri mark two recent examples of just how hard it is bringing such a device to market. In fact, with the exception of the single-minded Roomba line, youd be hard-pressed to name a product that has truly hit mainstream acceptance. 
Its with that in mind, that Misty has given its substantial runway. The startup has long term goals of bringing a truly accessible mainstream robotic to market but its going to take a few years and a lot of baby steps. 
Things started with last years Misty I, a handmade version of the companys modular robotics platform. CEO Tim Enwall tells me the company ultimately sold dozens of the machines, with the express plan to eventually phase the product out in favor of the more polished Misty II. The second robot is set to arrive in April, following a successful crowd funding campaign in whcih the company raised just short of $1 million.
At $2,399, the new Misty isnt cheap (thanks, in part, to the current administrations trade tariffs). But, then, mainstream accessibility was never really the point. Misty II may be reasonably adorable, but its a platform first. The company is current software and hardware developers and the maker community in an attempt to build a robust catalog of skills. Think of it something akin to the app store approach to creating robots. 
The plan here is to have a full selection of skills in place before the company targets consumers, while having third-party developers do much of the heavy software lifting. Developers, meanwhile, get a reasonably accessible hardware platform on which to test their programs. By the time company eventually comes to market, the theory goes, Misty will have a robust feature set thats been lacking in just about every consumer robot that has preceded it.
That means that Misty II is less personality driven that, say, Cosmo. The on-board sensors and data collection is far more important to the products appeal that Pixar-animated eyes. 
Of course, the products success will hinge entirely on that adoption, and its hard to say how large the potential market is, especially at that price point. Misty II is reasonably sophisticated and could have appeal for educators, among others, but its not really the same class of product as, say, those developed by the now-defunct Willow Garage.","The road to consumer robots is littered with the remains of failed startups.

Sarah Perez,"Apple today opened registration for thousands of free “Hour of Code” sessions taking place at its Apple Store locations around the world from December 1st through the 14th. The sessions are one of several programs the company has underway focused on helping more people learn to code both inside and outside the classroom. For the sixth year, Apple says it will host daily Hour of Code sessions through “Today at Apple.” These take place during the first two weeks of December and will focus on teaching aspiring coders core concepts. For those ages 6 to 12, the sessions will involve coding with robots, while attendees 12 and up will use the educational app Swift Playgrounds to learn coding basics. Apple today also introduced new material for teachers participating in Computer Science Education Week – the educational campaign held in early December which aims to introduce computer science and coding to K through 12 students. The company created an Hour of Code Facilitator Guide that helps educators host sessions where students learn to use Swift Playgrounds along with other iPad apps. Related to this, Apple also introduced a new Swift Coding Club kit for teachers and students that provides the materials needed for them to start their own coding clubs at school. This kit is designed for students ages 8 and up, and will see them collaborating, prototyping and learning about how to code an app. The Swift Playgrounds educational app, launched just over two years ago, is today available in 15 languages, including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Japanese, Apple noted. The app has been expanded since launch to include more courses, like those for programming toy robots or building apps that use AR, for example. Now, Apple is turning mastery of the app into an AP (Advanced Placement) high school course, too. The company says it will launch a free AP Computer Science Principles course syllabus and curriculum for the next school year, which will give students the chance to earn AP credit for learning to code in Swift. Students will also be able to take a certification exam – the App Development with Swift Level 1 exam – following their completion of the class. These will be held by Certiport Authorized Testing Centers worldwide, and will test students’ knowledge of Swift, app developer tools and core components of apps. Swift Playgrounds has been a significant part of Apple’s educational efforts over the past couple of years. In 2016, the company launched Everyone Can Code, which teaching coding to students from kindergarten to college and beyond.

Ingrid Lunden,"In 2012, Cisco made one of its biggest-ever acquisitions — and a major step into the Israeli tech world — when it acquired video and security specialist NDS for $5 billion. Now, the company is selling part of that business to one of its previous owners, the private equity firm Permira, as it looks to refocus itself and boost growth in networking, multi-cloud, security, data, and collaboration services. Permira says it is acquiring selected video technology assets, along with other cloud technology services, which it plans to launch as a new, standalone business. The new, rebranded company will be “focused on developing and delivering video solutions for the Pay-TV industry,” and it will unveil its new name and more details after the transaction is closed. The board of Cisco has already approved the deal, and it is expected to close in Q1 of the 2019 fiscal year. Abe Peled, the former chairman and CEO of NDS and a Permira advisor, will be leading the new company (the CEO as yet is unnamed). He said in a statement that the business had been profitable under Cisco. “We are proud of our innovation in video and the customer momentum that the Service Provider Video group has built,” said Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO, Cisco, in a statement. “With the leadership team and Abe as Chairman, the new company is well-positioned to drive this work forward and continue to deliver the solutions that meet the current and future needs of service provider video customers. Service providers remain a key customer segment for Cisco, and we look forward to continuing to partner with them to deliver new revenue-generating services and experiences.” More from Cisco on the divestment here, and there may be yet more detail when the company reports its quarterly earnings in two weeks. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. There are reports in the Israeli press of a $1 billion price tag, but I’ve been told by a source that this is “way off.” I’ll add more detail as and when I get it. There have been reports swirling since November 2017 that Cisco was looking to divest its Videoscape business and that Permira would be the buyer. From what we understand, the assets represent a significant chunk of Cisco’s service provider video business. The include the following: Among the assets that were part of the original NDS business, Permira is buying Cisco’s video security services, including smartcards and software solutions associated with conditional access security; video middleware, or software solutions that provide advanced user experiences on any underlying set-top box hardware; and software for video services. Among the assets that were a part of Cisco’s Infinite Video Platform (IVP), Permira is acquiring Cisco’s cloud video recording solutions for managing, storing, and playing recordings; cloud platform solutions for video consumption on any device on any network; and video processing solutions covering encryption, management and distribution of live and on-demand content. Permira is not acquiring video and media technology that Cisco is using related to its existing networking, multi-cloud, security, data and collaboration services. In other words, WebEx and things like that are not a part of this deal. The divestment is key development for Cisco. Across much of 2017, the company reported little growth in its major segments and has more generally been facing a lot of pricing pressure around its hardware and networking businesses. “Other products”, meanwhile, have seen their revenues shrinking (see here and here ). In that context, the NDS business and related solutions may have been seen by some as legacy assets that needed to be cut away so that Cisco could focus more on trying to grow other parts of its business. Those that were called out in a blog post by Yvette Kanouff, SVP of Cisco’s service provider business, include mass-scale networking, automation, optical, optics, cable access, and mobility, security, collaboration, IoT, and professional services. Created to serve Pay-TV companies as they existed in the late 80s-2000s — it was originally founded in 1988 — NDS at one point was even co-owned by one of them, News Corp, which had a 49 percent stake in NDS, with Permira holding 51 percent, when it was sold to Cisco for $5 billion in 2012. (For some extra context, News Corp and Permira originally paid $3.7 billion for NDS when they took it private in 2009.) Times have moved on, though. The development of cloud-based video and streaming have led to a different class of set-top boxes. And more importantly, a growing number of consumers now choose to bypass traditional PayTV providers altogether, either opting for something like an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV solution, or going the direct to Internet route and using YouTube and other services. That also means a lot of pricing pressure for those who are still working with these providers. The theory behind divesting the Cisco assets and rebuilding them is that many of these Pay-TV providers are still very much in business and want to stay that way, so there is an opportunity to both service them as is, but also come up with new products and services to help bring them into the 21st century. “This is a unique opportunity to lead and shape the video industry during its transition with the flexibility as a private company,” said Dr. Peled in a statement. “The new company will have the scale, technology innovation, and world-class team to deliver outstanding go-to-market execution, customer engagement, and new end-user experiences. Cisco has built a profitable business in the video space with innovations to capitalize on IP distribution and cloud-based services. These combined assets provide a significant new opportunity for the new company. I am thrilled to be working again in this area with Permira who is committed to innovation and support for our Pay-TV customers, and look forward to the ongoing working relationship with Cisco in support of our mutual customers.”","In 2012, Cisco made one of its biggest-ever acquisitions — and a major step into the Israeli tech world — when it acquired video and security specialist NDS for $5 billion.

Sam Rutherford,"The Essential Phone was supposed to be the one. Envisioned by Andy Rubin, the father of Android itself, and expertly crafted from a luxurious combo of ceramic, titanium, and Gorilla Glass, the PH-1 had the kind of pedigree you rarely see from a startup, let alone one that was trying to put out its first phone. But when you look back, aided by the gift of hindsight, it’s clear there was no way Essential could have ever delivered on the hype, especially after a launch plagued by repeated delays, difficulty delivering orders, and unfinished software. And with a price of $700 at launch, when I said the PH-1 was too expensive to have a camera that bad, that wasn’t an opinion, it was fact. But now, six months later, things have changed. After multiple price drops have brought it down to $500 and ample time to update its software, the PH-1 is, essentially, a different phone now. In the time following its launch, our PH-1 review unit spent much of its time sitting in a drawer. In the fall, Essential was quickly forgotten due to phones like the iPhone X, Google’s second Pixel, and the return of the original big-ass phablet after a two year hiatus. The PH-1 wasn’t really in the same class as those other flagships, to the point that using it as a comparison device didn’t make much sense. But when I pulled it out about a week ago, I couldn’t help but think that the Essential still looks like a dime. Even when viewed side by side with the iPhone X, the PH-1 makes Apple’s ridiculously priced phone look clunky. There’s no awkward camera hump protruding from its back or even a logo to take away from its clean, elegant lines. And in front, the cutout for the PH-1 8-MP selfie cam is both more stylish and less distracting than the iPhone X’s bloated notch—all while delivering a higher screen-to-body ratio than Apple’s handset too. There’s no doubt Essential nailed the design, and I appreciate it more now than I did before. Inside, the PH-1's UI is also spotless, running an unadulterated version of stock Android, which unfortunately remains on Android 7.1 instead of Android 8 Oreo. But the real test is in the phone’s camera app. At launch, on top of delivering soft images with a noticeable lack of detail, the phone often struggled to focus or even snap pics back-to-back in a timely manner. However, over the course of several repeated camera updates, Essential has made some marked improvements. Shutter response is faster, though you’ll still run into a bit of lag every now and then, and focusing speeds are quicker too. But the most important change is an overall improvement to image quality. After digging up a shot I took with the PH-1 at launch, I went and grabbed the exact same shot now that the phone has had six months of tinkering done to its camera. Even just a passing glance shows how much better the phone has gotten, but when you zoom into 100 percent, it’s obvious. Everything looks sharper and more detailed. Now you can see the texture on the concrete wall, and even colors look more vibrant. And the PH-1 doesn’t look good just when compared to itself either. In bright light, the PH-1 held its own against a photo captured by a OnePlus 5T. Sure, there are small differences in exposure and white balance, but if you look close, you might even say the OP5T’s pic looks a little soft compared the PH-1. Finally, Essential is putting out pics the can stand up to equally priced competition. However, I do have to point out, this only holds true in well-lit conditions. In low-light, the PH-1 still labors. When I snapped a pic of a nearby plush in my living room with the lights turned down, I was shocked to see how different each phone’s low light pic looked. And all of this brings us back to pricing. While the phone still has it flaws, at $500, a lot of its quirks, such as its lack of a microSD card slot, wireless charging or any sort of water-resistance, are much more forgivable. So has Essential totally redeemed itself? Definitely, or at least as much as it could in the face of the hyperbolic promises it originally had about revolutionizing the industry. It’s not perfect, but it now it finally feels like Essential has something to build on. With a gorgeous body that is somehow more impressive than before, a tidy UI, improved software, and a price that makes sense, the PH-1 has carved out its niche. And even though we can’t quite figure out what’s going on with its new color options, those look good too.","The Essential Phone was supposed to be the one.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / A Google Nexus 5X. reader comments 1 Nearly a year ago, several people sued LG, claiming that numerous models that got caught in an endless “bootloop” error were unusable and therefore fatally defective. The affected models—the G4, G5, V10, V20, and the Nexus 5X—represent all of LG's flagship smartphones released in 2015 and 2016. LG contracted with Google in 2015 to manufacture the Nexus 5X, its inexpensive flagship phone. In June 2017, the proposed class-action lawsuit was ordered to arbitration, according to the terms of sale. Many companies have similar language in their employment and sales contracts—arbitration nearly always benefits corporate interests over individual ones. However, Ars has learned that LG has now privately settled the arbitration claims that stemmed from the original lawsuit, Chamberlain v. LG, which was first filed in federal court in Los Angeles. Arbitration is a private, quasi-legal procedure originally designed to expedite disputes between corporations. Hearings have the trappings of a court hearing—arbitrators are often retired judges—except that they are wholly private. Even worse for consumers is that in the world of arbitration, there is no possibility of class-action claims. Arbitration proceedings are additionally nearly always shrouded from public view, so it is traditionally difficult to find out how many other people have been affected by the same issue. Under the terms of the settlement, clients of the firm that filed Chamberlain, Girard Gibbs, will receive either $425 cash or a $700 rebate toward the purchase of a new phone. Some media outlets erroneously reported on Thursday that this settlement is for all LG customers who bought the affected phones. As the lawsuit was never formally certified as a class-action by the judge, terms of the agreement likely remain limited to hundreds of people even though the estimated total of people who bought those five handsets is likely to be in the millions. However, according to the Girard Gibbs website, LG will now extend the warranty for all customers who bought those specific models from 12 months since the date of purchase to 30 months. LG did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment. Its customer service department can be reached here.",Chamberlain v.

Rhett Allain,"Occasionally there are physics lab demonstrations that I think are pretty awesome but that my students just think are ""meh."" This is one of those cases. The basic idea in this demo, which I used in my class at Southeastern Louisiana University, is to swing a mass around in a horizontal circle. But wait! There's a cooler part: By running the string through a vertical tube and attaching it to another mass, we can control the tension in the string. It's loads of fun. What am I talking about? Maybe this will help. Yes. That is me. I have a confused look on my face because I have to concentrate to keep the swinging length constant. Maybe this is why the students dislike this lab. Oh well. There are a few important features of this swinging mass. Let me draw a diagram. If you want to swing the mass around with a lower angular velocity, the string will need to be longer. If you want a shorter string, the mass will have to spin around faster. This is the only way to make it work since the tension in the string is constant. Why is the tension constant? Consider the mass hanging down at the bottom of the tube (I have labeled this M 2 ). Since this mass is just hanging there (and not spinning in a circle) then it is in equilibrium with an acceleration of zero meters per second squared. Since the acceleration (in the y-direction) is zero, then the net force must be zero Newtons. There are only two forces in the vertical direction, the downward gravitational force with a magnitude of M 2 g (where g = 9.8 N/kg) and the upward tension (T). That means the tension has to have a value of M 2 g—no matter how you are swinging the other mass. What about that angle that the string makes as the mass moves around in a circle (labeled as θ above)? How does this angle change as you swing at different speeds? Let me start with a force diagram for mass m 1. Although this mass is moving in a circle, it's just a horizontal circle. There is no motion and no acceleration in the vertical direction. This means the net force in the y-direction must be zero. Looking at the tension, the component of tension in the y-direction depends on the magnitude of the tension (which I already know) and the angle (which I don't). I can write this as the following equation. Using the value of the magnitude of the tension (from before), I get the following expression for θ. That's it—θ. It doesn't even depend on how fast you swing the mass or the string length. That sort of seems crazy, but it's true. Since the tension in the string is constant and the vertical component of the tension force must be constant, the angle must also be constant. Let me just check with a quick measurement. Here are two swings with the same masses, but different lengths. From this, it seems I get 30.4° and 22.8°. That's not exactly the same—not quite sure why there is such a difference. One problem might be that I am not exactly swinging it in a horizontal circle. Maybe I will have to do a bit more exploration here. OK, there is one more thing to look at. What about the relationship between the angular velocity and the length of the string? Looking at the force diagram above, there is only a component of the tension force acting in the horizontal direction. This means the net horizontal force can't be zero. In fact, it has to be equal to the mass (m 1 ) multiplied by the acceleration. In this case, the mass is accelerating to the right since it is moving in a circle. The circular acceleration would be the product of the angular velocity squared (we like to use the symbol ω for this) and the radius of the circle. Notice that the radius of the circle is not the length of the string—instead it is the length of the string multiplied by the cosine of θ (to get that adjacent side of the triangle). Putting this together, I get the following. This equation says that the square of the angular velocity should be proportional to one divided by the length of the string. That seems simple enough to test. All I need to do is to swing the mass around with different length strings (the length from the top of the tube to the mass). I can do this by watching a small piece of tape at the bottom of the tube to make sure the length is constant. Of course I need to also keep the masses constant. I can determine the angular velocity by measuring the time it takes the mass to make one rotation. The angular velocity will then bey 2π divided by this time. I did this for five different lengths using a hanging mass of 50 grams and a swinging mass of 15.8 grams. Here is a plot of ω squared vs. 1/L: That looks fairly linear. But the important part is the slope. Looking back at the relationship between ω 2 and 1/L, the proportionality constant should be M 2 g/m 1. I know the masses and I know g, so this constant should be 31 m/s 2. The linear fit has a slope of 43 m/s 2 —so not quite the same, but still close. Still, if this was a student lab report, I think that data would be acceptable. I'm still slightly concerned that the swinging angle isn't constant and this slope isn't closer to the expected value. I have a feeling that there might be some friction between the string and the rotating glass rod. Friction at the contact point would mean that the tension in the string at the swinging mass is not M 2 g, but something else. Maybe I need to come up with a different method to measure the tension.

We Are The Mighty,"The F-35Bs lined up for takeoff on USS Wasp (LHD 1) are potent. Imagine if Wasp was hauling a full squadron of them. US Navy The US officially has 11 aircraft carriers, but it also has nine other ships that can serve as carriers in a pinch. Those are the eight Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and the single America-class vessel in service. But because the America and the Wasp were designed to haul Marines around, they're not going to perform as well as a full-scale carrier. How many carriers does the United States Navy have? Well, between the ten Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and the freshly commissioned USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the first of her class, you might think the answer is 11 — but you'd be underestimating. There are nine other ships in the fleet that can serve as carriers in a pinch. Those are the eight Wasp-class amphibious assault ships and the single America-class vessel in service. Their primary role, currently, is to carry about a battalion's worth of Marines and attachments, usually in conjunction with an amphibious transport dock, like USS San Antonio (LPD 17), and a landing ship dock, like USS Whidbey Island (LSD 41). But these massive ships are actually much more versatile. Just look at a ship like USS America. What does she look like? Well, there's a flat deck all the way down the ship and an island on the right. In fact, if you were to take a look at perhaps the greatest U.S. Navy ship of World War II, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV 6), you may notice a striking similarity. Looking at USS Essex (LHD 2) from behind, her resemblance to World War II aircraft carriers is undeniable. US Navy Today, USS America, as well as her Wasp-class predecessors, haul around the Air Combat Element of a Marine Expeditionary Unit. In Tom Clancy's 1996 book, Marine: A Guided Tour of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit was equipped with six AV-8B Harriers, twelve CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, eight CH-53E Sea Stallion helicopters, eight AH-1W Cobras, and three UH-1N Hueys for a deployment. That is a total of 37 aircraft. But imagine for a moment that you were able to mess around with the numbers a little. First, let's offload all of the helicopters. Instead, let's put an entire squadron of 15 Harriers on board, or offload the six Harriers in favor of a squadron of 16 F-35B Lightnings. Next, let's add about a dozen of the Navy's MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. And presto, you now have an air group on board that is outclassed only by the air groups on the French Charles de Gaulle and the U.S. Navy's Nimitz- and Ford-classes of carriers. Because the America and the Wasp were designed to haul Marines around, they're not going to perform as well as a full-scale carrier. They'll also have a much more limited capacity than their larger counterparts. But they could fill in somewhere in a pinch. In essence, they are ""backup carriers"" and you never know when having those backups might save America's butt.","US Navy The US officially has 11 aircraft carriers, but it also has nine other ships that can serve as carriers in a pinch.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","Because getting a college education isnt expensive enough, the fees for taking the SAT and ACT tests as part of the admissions process can be a hardship for many high school students and their families.
Vox breaks down the costs:
Currently, it costs $47.50 to take the SAT ($64.50 with the Essay portion), and $22 for each of the SAT subject tests, not including the $26 registration fee. The ACT costs $50.50 ($67 with the Writing portion), and for each test there are extra costs for late registration. Advanced Placement (AP) tests cost $94. 
Add in the fact that many college counselors recommend taking the test multiple times to use the best scores, and the numbers can get out of hand very quickly.
Some colleges and universities are de-emphasizing the need for SAT and ACT test results, particularly if students meet a minimum grade point average or class rank. Functionally speaking, however, these tests are still very much ingrained in the college application process. 
Low-income high school students may qualify for fee waivers, though, if they meet certain requirements. The College Board details who is eligible for SAT fee waivers, as well as how to apply:
Youre eligible for fee waivers if you say yes to any of the following:
Youre enrolled in or eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).
Your annual family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
Youre enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., Federal TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
Your family receives public assistance.
You live in federally subsidized public housing or a foster home, or are homeless.
You are a ward of the state or an orphan.
Similarly, the ACT fees are waived for students who meet these criteria:
1. They are currently enrolled in high school in the 11th or 12 grade.
2. Are testing in the United States, U.S. territories or Puerto Rico.
3. Meet one or more of these indicators of economic need:
Are enrolled in a federal free or reduced-price lunch program at school, based on the USDAs income levels.
Are enrolled in a program for the economically disadvantaged, such as federally funded programs like GEAR UP or Upward Bound.
Reside in a foster home, is a ward of the state or is homeless.
Family receives low-income public assistance or lives in federally subsidized public housing.
Familys total annual income is at or below USDA levels for free or reduced-price lunches on the USDA Food and Nutrition Service website.
Contact your childs school counselor for help with the fee waiver application process or to determine whether you qualify.

The 9.9% have rigged the system every bit as much as the 1% have: they live in exclusive ZIP codes with the nation's best ""public"" schools; they spend vast fortunes to get their kids into elite private colleges; they get better health care and serve easier prison time; they live longer and they pass all these privileges on to their children. Along with the 1%, the 9.9% are recreating the Gilded Age, right down to the creation of a class of ""governesses"" (under the modern job description of ""nanny""): ""both indistinguishable in all outward respects from the upper class and yet emphatically not a member of it."" The inequality, corruption, and social immobility of 2018 America is meeting and surpassing all the key metrics that made the Gilded Age so very unstable. Matthew Stewart -- author of a magesterial longread on America's new aristos -- is the descendant of a corrupt oil executive who was key to the Teapot Dome scandal and whose shadow looms over the Stewart family. Stewart uses his substantial literary gifts and the editorial generosity of the Atlantic to catalog the non-monetary ways in which wealth is accumulated, hoarded, and passed on intergenerationally, with a special emphasis on the psychological delusions about the self-made nature of the 9.9% and the ""meritocratic"" system that has elevated them, and their children, to the status of precarious courtiers to the billionaire class. Stewart thinks that we're on a collision course with disaster: this kind of inequality ""has reliably ended only in catastrophic violence: wars, revolutions, the collapse of states, or plagues and other disasters."" Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are all two to three times more common in individuals who have a family income of less than $35,000 than in those who have a family income greater than $100,000. Among low-educated, middle-aged whites, the death rate in the United States—alone in the developed world—increased in the first decade and a half of the 21st century. Driving the trend is the rapid growth in what the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton call “deaths of despair”—suicides and alcohol- and drug-related deaths. The sociological data are not remotely ambiguous on any aspect of this growing divide. We 9.9 percenters live in safer neighborhoods, go to better schools, have shorter commutes, receive higher-quality health care, and, when circumstances require, serve time in better prisons. We also have more friends—the kind of friends who will introduce us to new clients or line up great internships for our kids. These special forms of wealth offer the further advantages that they are both harder to emulate and safer to brag about than high income alone. Our class walks around in the jeans and T‑shirts inherited from our supposedly humble beginnings. We prefer to signal our status by talking about our organically nourished bodies, the awe-inspiring feats of our offspring, and the ecological correctness of our neighborhoods.

Graham Rapier,"The long-awaited day is finally here: Lyft is going public.
 The ride-hailing company is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Friday with an initial price of $72 per share, or a total valuation of about $21 billion. 
 That last-minute surge, fueled by standing-room-only meetings on its investor roadshow, has helped push Lyft's co-founders' stakes to a total of more than $1 billion, based on their disclosed holdings in company filings. 
 Here's the breakdown: 
 Logan Green: 684,591 class A shares and 7,689,182 class B shares worth a total of $602.9 million at IPO prices. 
 John Zimmer: 684,591 class A shares and 5,090,527 class B shares worth a total of $415.8 million at IPO prices. 
The two founders aren't the only ones to strike it rich with Lyft's massive IPO but they will keep a majority of voting power over corporate issues thanks to the stock's dual class structure. 
 The controversial division between voting classes will allow Green and Zimmer to maintain ""significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets."" 
 That's rubbed some industry watchers, like the Council of Institutional Investors, the wrong way. The group's executive director wrote a letter to Lyft's board of directors in February saying ""public companies should provide all shareholders with voting rights proportional to their holdings."" 
 Governance structures aside, plenty of other investors set to get rich, too. As Business Insider's Julie Bort reported from the company's initial S-1 documents, other early investors could also see a massive windfall. 
 COO Jon McNeill, who joined the company from Tesla in 2018 holds 736,932 shares that could be worth $5.3 million. 
 Sean Aggarwal, best known for his roles as the vice president of finance for eBay, PayPal, and Trulia, joined Lyft's board in 2016. His roughly 1.41 million shares that could be worth about $101 million at IPO prices. 
 The US' largest automaker, General Motors, and financial giant Fidelity each own nearly 19 million shares, or about 8% of the company each.

BILLY WITZ,"Baseball journalists make up the voting bloc for the Hall of Fame, and the final vote totals will be announced on Jan. 24, with Chipper Jones looking like a lock for induction in his first year on the ballot. By Sunday evening, more than 150 ballots, or about one-third of the expected total, had been made public, and they showed that some players were making significant progress from a year ago, but not Bonds and Clemens. For instance, Vladimir Guerrero has picked up 26 votes from returning voters and seems in a strong position to be inducted in his second year on the ballot. Larry Walker has garnered 23 additional votes, Edgar Martinez has amassed an additional 16 and Trevor Hoffman has added eight. Even Curt Schilling, whose controversial political comments most likely cost him votes a year ago, has picked up 13 votes so far. Photo Roger Clemens won 354 major league games in a career that ended in 2007, but he has yet to be voted into the Hall of Fame. Credit John Dunn for The New York Times But as of Sunday, Bonds and Clemens remained right where they were a year ago — with no net gain from returning voters. “With stable voters, everybody is pretty entrenched,” Ryan Thibodaux, who compiles votes that have been made public on his Baseball Hall of Fame Vote Tracker, said of Bonds and Clemens. “Their hope is definitely that a turnover is enough to help them make the jump.” On the surface, the early voting for 2018 looks promising for both Bonds, who is baseball’s career home run leader with 762, and Clemens, who won 354 games. They had both received 70.2 percent of the 151 ballots that had been revealed as of Sunday evening, according to Thibodaux’s Tracker. But Thibodaux said that based on previous voting patterns, he expected those vote totals to decline as more ballots are tabulated, much as they did last year when Bonds’s final total was 53.8 percent and Clemens’s was 54.1 percent, after both had hovered around 70 percent with a little more than one-third of the votes counted. Still, the percentages that Bonds and Clemens did end up with a year ago were their highest annual totals to date. “With the early ballots, the percentage is looking really high, but by the time it’s all said and done, they’re going to drop a lot,” Thibodaux said of the current totals. “I think they’ll end up in the 50s again.” But Bonds and Clemens have gained ground in the 2018 balloting with new voters, which could prove increasingly significant in ensuing years as more new voters emerge and other voters continue to be culled from the ranks. In 2015, new voter-eligibility rules were established that eliminated any voters who had not covered baseball regularly as a member of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America in the previous 10 years. In effect, it is the mirror image of the rule that allows journalists to become eligible to vote after they have covered baseball for 10 years. (Five newspapers do not allow their members to vote: The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times.) Actually, what really gave Bonds and Clemens a boost in last year’s balloting was the reasoning of some established voters that if Bud Selig, the longtime commissioner, was being inducted as part of the 2017 class then players who were tainted by the steroid era that Selig presided over should not be barred from the Hall, either. That led to more than 20 voters deciding to switch from no to yes when it came to Bonds and Clemens. But Selig is no longer the provocative issue he was a year ago. Instead, it appears Bonds and Clemens are now left to rely on support from new voters while also benefiting from the gradual removal of voters who continued to oppose them. Consider that last year, there were 21 new voters in all, and they gave substantial support to Bonds and Clemens. And this time around, according to the vote tracker, Clemens has picked up support from all eight of the first-time voters who made their ballots public by Sunday, and Bonds had the backing of seven of those voters. Meanwhile, of the six voters who confirmed they had lost their vote this year, all declined to vote for either Bonds or Clemens a year ago. Another 14 writers could be eligible to vote next year, and as many as 22 could be eligible to vote for the class of 2020, according to Jack O’Connell, secretary-treasurer of the writers’ association. But not all who are eligible choose to vote. This year, the association provided names of 21 eligible new voters to the Hall of Fame, but only 16 completed the registration form and signed a code of conduct — requisites to receive a ballot. Thibodaux was skeptical that Bonds and Clemens would ever get to 75 percent in their remaining years on the ballot. “The only thing I can see is you’d need another Selig-type moment — maybe somebody in the Hall of Fame comes out and says, ‘I used steroids,’ ” he said. “Something like that would have to happen to have any chance of getting to 75 percent.” If Bonds and Clemens’s race against the clock in their bid for enshrinement does come down to their final year, there is little doubt the vote will be a referendum on the steroid era. Appearing on a ballot for the first time in the class of 2022 will be another familiar and polarizing figure: Alex Rodriguez.

If you’re holing up for a wild weekend of screaming into pillows and drunk-dialing members of Congress, may I suggest treating yourself to ninety minutes of unbridled female excellence courtesy of the National Women’s Soccer League? You deserve it. A Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday made the push-pull defense we’ve seen among Brett… Read more Read Women’s soccer tends to be a hard sell for a lot of viewers, which is a shame because it rules. Everything that people think they hate about soccer is largely absent from women’s games: there’s no diving, no stop-drop-and-roll antics, no tearful, Oscar-worthy appeals to the officials. To put a finer point on it, unlike top mens’ leagues, Twitter, the news, prestige TV, the White House, most workplaces, and general public life, NWSL games are utterly devoid of overpaid adult men throwing full-on pissbaby tantrums to get their way. What a concept! There are plenty more reasons to watch this game in particular, and everyone from total newcomers to huge soccer nerds can find something to root for. Newbies are in good hands thanks to Aly Wagner and Jenn Hildreth’s top-notch commentary work, which effortlessly blends expert analysis and genuine, infectious enthusiasm for the game. If you’re just here for the drama, I have great news: Saturday’s final is a rematch, and the defending champions have home-field advantage. Even better, the home field in question is a sold-out Providence Park in Portland, Oregon—which means the atmosphere is going to be unreal. Can 21,000 very loud fans help the Portland Thorns beat the North Carolina Courage, a feat they haven’t managed since last year’s final? As a Portland fan, I dunno—the Courage has lost exactly one game this season, and they seem fundamentally disinterested in losing another. No matter the outcome, I’m pumped for what promises to be a barn-burner of a match. If you are, too, get ready to tune into Lifetime this Saturday, September 22nd, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific/4:30 P.M. Eastern. (Yes, Lifetime.) For more context, here’s a primer on the teams and their standout players. North Carolina Courage: The Terrifying Juggernaut With No Apparent Weaknesses The Courage scored more goals this season than any team in NWSL history, and they’ve got their formula down pat. Abby Dahlkemper dribbles into space and passes the ball up to Jess McDonald, who holds it as Lynn Williams makes a run into the box. More often than not, Lynn Williams scores. Sometimes Crystal Dunn gets involved, and sometimes Dahlkemper contributes a free kick instead of a run upfield, but the essential strategy rarely changes. Why should it? This goal was William’s second that game, her thirteenth that season, and the Courage’s fifty-first in 2018: Video courtesy of NWSLSoccer on YouTube. Players to watch: It’s kinda hard to beat the completely absurd Jess McDonald/Lynn Williams combo, though I haven’t fully recovered from this jaw-dropping Sam Mewis goal. I’m probably most excited to watch reigning Defender of the Year Abby Dahlkemper and human Swiss Army Knife Crystal Dunn, but the entire squad is just stacked. Portland Thorns: The Scrappy, Beautiful Hot Mess Defending Champs With two championships (2013 and 2017) to their name, the Thorns have always been at least competitive, if not outright dominant. Still, this sure didn’t seem like their year: key attackers Allie Long, Amandine Henry, and Nadia Nadim all left for other teams, and injuries kept defender Emily Menges and world-class playmaker Tobin Heath off the starting lineup until early May. Also, first-string goalie Adrianna Franch had knee surgery in April. That’s a lot of change all at once, but the Thorns figured it out, started scoring more goals, and earned a spot in their second consecutive championship game. That’s why I think this frustrating, sloppy, breathtaking display is the 2018 Thorns goal: Video courtesy of NWSLSoccer on YouTube. Players to watch: League MVP front-runner Lindsey Horan has scored banger after banger after banger all season long, mostly with her head, and mostly in cahoots with Tobin Heath and Christine Sinclair. As for the back line, Adrianna Franch will likely make a ridiculous save or three, and Emily Menges has a history of coming up with huge blocks in big games. Finally, we have to talk about North Carolina’s Jaelene Hinkle. She’s an excellent defender but also a vocal, unrepentant homophobe who declined a national team spot because she couldn’t bring herself to wear rainbow numbers on her back. She’s gotten plenty of blowback on social media for this choice, but the only real-life consequence has been boos from Portland fans. This is significant: in a sport where mens’ supporter groups routinely participate in homophobic chants, hearing a crowd boo an athlete for being homophobic feels downright cathartic. A sold-out Thorns match at Providence Park is the opposite of a safe space for homophobes, so Saturday should be interesting for Jaelene to say the least. Jaelene Hinkle is a 25-year-old American soccer player who currently plays for the NWSL’s North… Read more Read Courage coach Bob Riley and teammate Jess McDonald have defended Hinkle in interviews, but judging by the silence from everyone else, her comments have put her many LGBTQ colleagues in a deeply uncomfortable position. As a fan, it’s at least comforting to know that the NWSL’s “come-as-you-are” supporter culture does not apply to bigots. If that’s not a compelling reason to tune in after an unbearably long week of terrible stories about terrible men, I don’t know what is. The 2018 NWSL Championship kicks off tomorrow, September 22nd, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific time (4:30 P.M. Eastern).

Bryan Menegus,"A lawsuit filed in August of 2014 on behalf of California Uber drivers is finally paying out, and recipients of the $7.75 million settlement are finding their share leaves something to be desired. Back in August of 2014, a driver named Steven Price sued Uber for damages resulting from alleged labor misclassification, including failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, missed meal periods and rest periods, and unlawful business practices. In short, Price claimed Uber drivers were employees the company was treating as contractors, a scheme that has become a staple of the gig economy, most visibly affecting rideshare drivers, last-mile package couriers, and those engaged in food delivery or personal shopping. That suit was settled in late January of this year, and payments were scheduled to arrive on or before last Friday. That $7.75 million was split among “any and all Drivers who consented to a background check as part of the sign-up process to use the Uber software application and/or used the Uber software application to generate leads in California at anytime from July 8,2013 up to and including January 29, 2017,” according to the settlement. But after plaintiffs’ attorney fees, administration costs, and allocations to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, the amount apportioned to drivers was less than $1 million. Even though the time period covered by the suit represents three and a half years, a number of drivers posting on Reddit and other ridershare driver forums describe payments of less than $20 —some drastically so. Three drivers sent Gizmodo copies of the notices they received. One was awarded $7.05. Another, 75 cents. The third was given just 15 cents. Though we were unable to verify settlement amounts beyond these three claims before publication, other posts suggest $3 to $5 was average. This is partly a result of the structure of California’s Private Attorneys General Act—a law for employee recovery of civil penalties in labor violations—and with class-action suits in general.

Timothy B. Lee,"Enlarge / The Lucid Air, due out in 2020. reader comments 10 Lucid Motors, the electric car startup we described as Tesla's most credible rival last year, got a shot in the arm on Monday as Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund announced a $1 billion investment. The company aims to bring its first car to market in 2020. Lucid has been building up to this moment for more than a decade. The company was founded in 2007 under the name Atieva to build technology related to electric cars—but not the entire car itself. In 2015, the Chinese state-owned automaker BAIC became Lucid's biggest investor, and we learned that Atieva was pivoting to face Tesla head-on by building an electric car of its own. The company rebranded as Lucid two years ago and has a number of Tesla veterans—including chief technology officer Peter Rawlinson—helping design its first car, the Lucid Air. Ars Technica's Jonathan Gitlin got a firsthand look at a prototype of Lucid's first model, the Lucid Air, 18 months ago, and he liked what he saw. Gitlin described it as ""remarkably functional for such an early stage in the development process."" Lucid is aiming for the same luxury sedan market as Tesla's Model S. Lucid brags that its prototype is the size of a Mercedes-Benz E Class while offering more interior space than the roomier S Class. We reported last year that the high-end model is expected to cost upwards of $100,000. It will come with a dual-motor, 1,000 horsepower setup that enables acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. While the company has an impressive prototype, what it hasn't had, until now, is enough money to turn that into a shipping commercial product. Lucid announced early last year that it was building a factory in Arizona, but work on the factory stalled for more than a year as Lucid looked for $700 million in financing. Raising $1 billion from Saudi Arabia will finally allow Lucid to move ahead at full speed, with production now scheduled to begin in 2020. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund also took a significant position in Tesla earlier this year. If Tesla's history is any indication, the company will need to raise more money—probably a lot more—if it hopes to become a mainstream carmaker. Tesla has burned through billions of dollars in recent years as it brought the Model X, the Model X, and then the Model 3 to market.",Lucid's impressive technology has been held back by a cash shortage.,2018-09-17T20:51:03Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Tesla’s most credible rival raises $1 billion from Saudi Arabia,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/lucid-motors-raises-1-billion-to-build-all-electric-cars-in-arizona/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lucid-Air-Exterior-9-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-1,1

JAMES R. OESTREICH,"Telling along the same lines was a trombone master class at Carnegie on Saturday morning, in which Mr. Friedman advocated compact tone (“try to make the sound smaller than the equipment wants it to be”) and differentiated articulation (“contrast is the key to style; evenness is the opposite of style.”). All this in good measure, of course, and the concerto soloists and the orchestra’s high brasses proved excellent models of moderation in both concerts. Still, accidents happen, and a trombone went momentarily but badly astray in the rising clamor at the end of Brahms’s Second Symphony on Saturday evening. That work — Brahms’s mellowest, least troubled symphony and hardly a blockbuster — was the biggest work on either program, and Mr. Muti, not always a convincing Brahmsian in earlier years, seems to have developed a greater affinity for the composer. Photo Standing from left, Mr. Muti, Jennifer Higdon, Jay Friedman and Gene Pokorny. Credit Todd Rosenberg The Saturday program was filled out by Verdi’s “I Vespri Siciliani” Overture and another new work commissioned by the orchestra, Samuel Adams ’s “many words of love.” The Adams work took its inspiration from Schubert’s song cycle “Winterreise,” specifically a phrase from “Der Lindenbaum” (“The Linden Tree”): “On its bark I carved do many words of love.” Not that you’d be likely to notice. Mr. Adams effectively buries the little melodic fragment in an extravagant, churning brew of live and digital sound whose main structural elements are extended, sometimes monumental, stepwise rises and falls. The program notes also mention a concern for “the ailing earth,” though here, too, you would not necessarily discover that concern without (even with) reading them. Mr. Adams’s own note describes the work’s paradoxical qualities: “tonal but noisy, lyrical but austere, Schubert but not at all.” No argument here. The other unhackneyed works in the slightly odd mix of Friday’s program were Stravinsky’s piquant “Scherzo Fantastique,” Chausson’s vocal-orchestral hybrid “Poème de l’Amour et de la Mer” (“Poem of Love and of the Sea”), and the Four Sea Interludes from Britten’s opera “Peter Grimes.” The mezzo-soprano Clémentine Margaine was a superb soloist in the Chausson, richly sonorous and warmly expressive, and the pairing of that work with the Britten was striking. Like the concerts themselves, the encores were anything but show-off-y: Giuseppe Martucci’s “Notturno” (Op. 70, No. 1), a longtime Muti favorite, on Friday and the B flat Intermezzo from Schubert’s incidental music for Helmina von Chézy’s play “Rosamunde” on Saturday. Correction: February 12, 2018 An earlier version of this article misstated the instrument that went astray at the end of a Brahms symphony. It was a trombone, not the trumpets.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Google’s claim that it doesn’t have a pay gap problem has once again been disputed, this time by a former preschool teacher who worked at the company’s childcare center. Former employee Heidi Lamar filed a complaint on Wednesday with the San Francisco Superior Court alleging that Google paid women in preschool and infant/toddler teaching positions less than men for similar jobs. The complaint was filed as an amendment to an existing class action lawsuit filed in September by former Google employees Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease, and Kelli Wisuri. Lamar is now included as a plaintiff on the lawsuit, which includes 30 different positions across six different categories, including product management, software engineering and sales. The lawsuit alleges that Google puts women in lower salary bands than men, places them in jobs that don’t pay as much as ones dominated by men, and promotes women “slowly and at lower rates than it promotes men.” It also alleges that female Google employees are paid less than men “performing similar work.” Additionally, the complaint claims that Google is or should have been aware of these violations. “Google’s failure to pay female employees the same compensation paid to male employees for substantially equal or substantially similar work has been and is willful,” the lawsuit states. According to the lawsuit, Lamar had a master’s degree in teaching, but was placed in a lower salary level than a male hired at the time who did not have a master’s degree in teaching or as much relevant job experience. Lamar was placed at salary Level 1, which paid $18.51 an hour, compared to the male who was hired for the same position and duties at salary Level 2, with an hourly rate of $21 an hour. Lamar was allegedly paid less than her male coworkers who performed similar positions as her from July 2013 until she was promoted at the end of 2016. Google employed about 150 preschool teachers at the time of Lamar’s employment, and about 147 were women. Of the three male teachers, two were hired into salary Level 2. “Ms. Lamar is only aware of one woman whom Google hired into salary Level 2 around or after Ms. Lamar’s start date, and that woman had over ten years of job experience,” the complaint states. “All the other women were hired into salary Level 1.” When Lamar discovered that she was underpaid compared to her male colleague in a similar position, she asked Google to compensate her for the wage gap from when she started through when she was promoted. Google declined to pay her for the discrepancy, and Lamar resigned in August of last year. Lamar’s claims follow a number of other pay gap allegations filed against Google over the past year. In April, the US Department of Labor accused the company of gender pay discrimination, which Google denied. The company also declined to provide the agency with requested historical salary records, claiming that the efforts were too costly. In September of last year, however, employees at Google took it upon themselves to compile their own wage data in a spreadsheet acquired by The New York Times, which revealed that men were on average paid more than women. Google spokesperson Gina Scigliano told Gizmodo at the time that its own data shows, when you take “location, tenure, job role, level and performance” into account, that “women are paid 99.7% of what men are paid at Google,” and characterized the Times story as “extremely flawed.” Shortly after the spreadsheet was publicized, Ellis, Pease, and Wisuri filed the class-action lawsuit that Lamar has since been added to as a plaintiff. Scigliano once again told Gizmodo that Google disagreed with the wage gap allegations. “We work really hard to create a great workplace for everyone, and to give everyone the chance to thrive here,” Scigliano said in September. “In relation to this particular lawsuit, we’ll review it in detail, but we disagree with the central allegations. Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions,” he continued. “And we have extensive systems in place to ensure that we pay fairly.” When Gizmodo reached out to Google to comment on the latest wave of allegations made by Lamar, Scigliano said that the company disagrees “with the central allegations of this amended lawsuit,” attaching her earlier statement from September.

NICHOLAS FANDOS and RON NIXON,"Questions about his travel continued to follow Mr. Long through the weekend, as he sought to project confidence in the Trump administration’s response to the slow-moving storm. On Sunday, Mr. Long pushed back on reports that Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, had asked him to step down because of his travel. “Let me go ahead and clear up all the news: Secretary Nielsen has never asked me to resign,” Mr. Long said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We have a very functional and professional relationship. We talk every day. We are both totally focused on Florence.” He argued that the use of agency vehicles was appropriate given his “very critical and important role to make sure this government works on the nation’s worst day through continuity in government.” “These vehicles are designed to provide secure communications and the program was actually developed in 2008 — it ran for me the same way it’s run for anybody else,” he said. “And you know, it’s my understanding that maybe some policies were not developed around these vehicles.” Mr. Gowdy gave Mr. Long until Oct. 1 to produce relevant documents, and an aide said that the Republican would wait until that date to proceed with other potential investigative actions. Mr. Gowdy, who is retiring at the end of the year, has used his gavel selectively since taking over the Oversight Committee last year. But he considers excessive spending, particularly on executive branch travel, to be an issue of concern. He previously studied official travel taken by Scott Pruitt, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. And amid a rash of reports last fall about Trump administration officials’ use of private planes, Mr. Gowdy and Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s top Democrat, jointly investigated travel by senior officials across the federal government. Mr. Cummings said on Monday that he supported an investigation but called on Republicans to simultaneously open an inquiry into the federal response to last year’s deadly hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Committee Democrats issued a report earlier this month accusing the Republicans of blocking a “credible” investigation. “If Chairman Gowdy wants to do an investigation of FEMA, the priority should be on helping the people of Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricanes last year and ensuring that they are not treated like second-class citizens,” he said. “The committee should investigate the administrator’s use of government vehicles, but the more urgent focus right now should be on obtaining documents from the White House regarding its response to the hurricanes that — so far — the committee has refused to even request.”","Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Monday he will investigate the potential misuse of government vehicles by FEMA’s chief.",2018-09-17T17:58:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Brock Long’s Woes Mount as House G.O.P.

Jack Stewart,"Prepping a satellite instrument for its journey into space can feel like getting ready to lift off yourself. The sensors on board are vulnerable to the slightest speck of contamination—so to get close, you have to suit up. Required clean room attire includes a hair net, face mask, paper suit, disposable boots, and surgical gloves. No notebooks allowed—only paper that doesn’t release fluff if you tear it—and no clicky ballpoint pens. They spit out tiny balls of ink. In the wee hours of Saturday, a fastidiously clean scanning machine named VIIRS launched into orbit on a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, just one instrument outfitting a next-generation weather satellite. The Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite is a washing machine-sized sensor, built to capture light and other waves that bounce off the surface of Earth. It collects those reflections, turning them into data about our planet, the oceans, land and vegetation cover, ice caps, volcanic plumes, and global temperatures—allowing accurate weather forecasts, wildfire and fishing fleet tracking, and climate monitoring. If an Enterprise-like starship were above us now, scanning our Class M planet for life, this sophisticated camera-telescope hybrid is the instrument it'd be using. Instead, the lookie-loos are NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A week ago I witnessed another VIIRS undergoing pre-launch testing at the headquarters of space and defense company, Raytheon, in Los Angeles. This was the identical sibling to the one that launched on the Joint Polar Satellite System-1 orbiter this morning, the third VIIRS instrument that Raytheon has built. (The first is in orbit, launched on the Suomi NPP satellite in 2011.) Ultimately, five of these sensors will orbit Earth—on four JPSS satellites and the S-NPP—spinning around the planet in vertical, polar orbits, scanning the surface below, and beaming that data back down to scientists. VIIRS may be just one instrument on board JPSS-1, but it's a particularly powerful one. With a resolution of 2,500 feet, enough to make out roads and cities, its counterpart on S-NPP can see exactly where Hurricane Maria wiped out electric power in Puerto Rico, for example, even if people there don’t have communications to ask for help. By looking in the green spectrum at light reflected from leaves containing chlorophyll, researchers can create a “normalized vegetation index” for drought-prone areas. “That’s important in trying to predict where areas are drying out, and where you need more or less irrigation,” says Robert Curbeam, Raytheon's vice president for space systems. Military customers, alternately, can use VIIRS data to figure out ocean visibility and temperature, which impacts how well sonar works. More VIIRS in orbit will mean even more of that valuable data. So in the clean room for VIIRS trois, engineers carefully unplug a ponytail of cables as they slide the instrument out of a 15 feet wide, very black, stainless steel chamber. When the door is sealed on the end, and the pumps run, testers can check VIIRS out in a near vacuum, in a cryogenically cooled environment. “It feels like it’s going to feel in space,” says Brian Fellers, manager for systems engineering at Raytheon. If something on board is going to fail, better that it happens here. This is just one stage of five months of verification tests. The optics are hidden behind a horizontal slot door. When that opens in space, incoming photons bounce off primary, secondary, and tertiary mirrors before they split off toward the sensors—one for infrared, one for visible light, and a more sensitive sensor for night time scanning. That entire assembly of mirrors spins in a housing the size of two coffee cans, taking just 1.78 seconds for a full rotation. That means the optics sweep across the Earth below horizontally, scanning a panoramic 1,864 mile swath, line by line, building up a picture of our world. Because nobody knows exactly how it could be used, the JPSS satellites are designed to beam that data back in a raw form. “The scientific community is finding ways to take the data and get more information out of it every week,” says Mark Sargent, Raytheon’s JPSS Programs director. And getting the data to researchers is another exercise in technical precision. JPSS is a polar orbiter, meaning it will pass over two points on the ground—the north and south poles—every 45 minutes. So Raytheon is upgrading its ground stations nearby in Norway, Alaska, and Antarctica, adding white domes to grab the five gigabytes of data that beam down during the 11 minutes the satellite is within range. In a single day, Suomi NPP sends down a total of 126GB. JPSS-1 will double that when it comes online soon. As more of the JPSS constellation launches, satellites will pass over the poles more frequently, meaning the data they send to forecasters on the ground will be even more real-time. “This year’s hurricane season was a real stress test for the system,” says Sargent. But it all worked as designed; Suomi NPP monitored the storms tracking across the Atlantic, helping forecasters give more accurate warnings of their paths. The scope and application of that data will grow as NASA and NOAA launch more of these next-gen satellites and their super-sensitive instruments, making the months of ball-point-pen-free clean-room testing all worthwhile.",Inside the squeaky-clean room where techs prepare weather instruments for launch.,2017-11-18T13:55:11Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",NASA's Next Generation JPSS Satellite Will Scan for Storms Like Never Before,https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-noaa-jpss-next-gen-satellite-will-scan-for-storms-like-never-before/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a09f11d74c62b689459d7c0/191:100/pass/RaytheonSatellite-HP.jpg,wired,Wired,class-1,1

Wirecutter,"Best 4K projector for home theater Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald If you want to set up a dedicated home theater in a basement or spare room and need a projector that can handle the latest 4K content, including high dynamic range and wide-color-gamut material, you'll want to upgrade to a 4K projector. They cost more than typical 1080p projectors, and due to the light requirements of high dynamic range they look best in a completely dark room. The JVC DLA-X590R offers the best combination of high contrast, high dynamic range, rich colors, and increased detail. Why we like it The JVC's high contrast ratio creates deeper blacks than most 4K projectors, which allows it to show more details in dark scenes and make everything on the screen pop more, especially HDR content. The wide-color-gamut support allows the projector to show most of the DCI/P3 color gamut from 4K content. This lets you see colors in 4K content that you can't see with lower-performing projectors. The projector's high dynamic range support lets you see improved detail in highlights and bright areas of images that other 4K projectors can't show as well. A motorized lens with lens shift, plus several preset image modes for different screen brands make this projector easier to set up than most others. Flaws but not dealbreakers It's very large. Like other 4K projectors, this one needs to be permanently mounted, so you can't pull it out to watch a movie and put it away after you're done. It needs a dark room, especially for HDR. If you're watching in a living room with the lights on, you might not see much benefit over cheaper models. Image technology: Three-chip LCoS Resolution: Pixel-shift ""4K"" (1920×1080 with eShift to 3840×2160) Lens shift: Vertical and horizontal, motorized Read more about all our picks in our guide to the best 4K projectors. Best affordable home entertainment projector Photo: Chris Heinonen If you don't want to spend a ton of money but still need a projector that produces a bright, colorful image and works well for both dedicated rooms and those with some ambient light, our pick offers the best combination of performance and value for most people. The BenQ HT2050A offers better contrast, color, and brightness than any projector in its class. Why we like it It offers the most accurate colors you can get from a projector for under $1,000. It's bright enough for a living room and can overcome some ambient light if you don't want to use it in a completely dark room. Out of the box this projector can produce a good image with very little adjustment, which means it's good for people new to projectors. Flaws but not dealbreakers The fan can be a little loud, but not enough that speakers at a moderate volume can't cover the noise. It's not really portable. If you want a projector you can carry around with you, our mini-projector picks are much more portable but can't produce as large of an image. In some images there's a slight red tint in 3D mode, which is common to projectors in this price range. Image technology: Single-chip DLP Resolution: HD (1920×1080) Audio: 10 watts per channel Read more about this pick and others in our cheap projector guide. Best mini projector Photo: Michael Hession If you need a small, compact projector you can easily put away, or even carry around with you in a backpack, a mini projector (also called a pico projector) might be your best fit. These don't produce images as big and bright as those of standard projectors, but then again these models can weigh less than a pound for portability. The AAXA P300 has the brightest picture and best contrast ratio of any mini projector we tested. Why we like it The AAXA produces a bright image with good contrast ratio for this category of projectors. The built-in battery gives you about an hour of playtime, and the built-in speakers mean you don't have to add a Bluetooth speaker. It has a short throw distance so you don't need to place it as far from the screen as other projectors. Includes a standard HDMI port and USB and miniSD ports for hookups. Flaws but not dealbreakers One-hour battery life isn't long enough to get through watching a movie. Some colors, especially red, can appear a bit oversaturated. The speakers aren't loud enough for a big room or outside use. Image technology: DLP/LED Resolution: SD (1280×800) Audio: 1 watt per channel × 2 Battery: 60 minutes You can read more about this projector and others in our full guide to portable mini projectors. Best projector for small spaces Photo: Chris Heinonen In order to create a large image most projectors need to be positioned far from the screen. This distance is called the throw distance, and can be anywhere from 8 to 15 feet, depending on the projector and desired image size. Short-throw projectors are convenient for small rooms or other situations where space is limited. The BenQ HT2150ST can sit much closer to the screen than a standard projector, and is bright enough to use in a room with some ambient light. Why we like it It works in spaces other projectors can't, producing a 100-inch image with only a couple feet of space. It produces a bright image that can work in a room that gets some ambient light. Its integrated speaker and small size make it easy to store when not being used. Flaws but not dealbreakers The short-throw lens can cause some fringing artifacts that you might notice. It's bright, but the colors aren't as accurate as those of the non-short-throw BenQ HT2050A. Image technology: Single-chip DLP Resolution: HD (1920×1080) Audio: 10 watts per channel You can read more about this projector here. A great screen for the money Photo: Silver Ticket Products If you have a projector, you should get a screen. Most modern projectors are bright enough to throw a decent image on just about any close-enough-to-white surface, but you won't get accurate colors without a proper screen. A screen has less texture than a wall, plus it will add pop to the image, because paint almost always has less gain (that is, it reflects less light) than a screen, meaning the image will appear dimmer than is ideal. The Silver Ticket 100"" performs as well as screens costing thousands of dollars. Why we like it The Silver Ticket 100"" can display accurate colors with good viewing angles without hotspots. Its performance is nearly as good as that of models costing far more. It's easier to assemble than many of its competitors.

"AP, AP","The Latest on national signing day (all times eastern): 9 a.m. Florida State and new coach Willie Taggart had some work to do to catch up with the other traditional powers on national signing day and the Seminoles got off to a nice start. One of the first announcements of the day out of Tallahassee, Florida, was Florida State flipping there-star running back Anthony Grant from a Tennessee commitment. Florida State could push to the finish with a top-10 class. ___ Georgia and Ohio State head into the national signing day with a chance to lock up the title of No. 1 class, while Alabama is closing fast along with traditional powers with new coaches. Most FBS teams filled the majority of their 2018 classes during the new early signing period in December. The traditional February date has most teams just topping of their classes. Georgia had the top-ranked class, according to 247 Sports' rankings, heading into Wednesday. Ohio State was second. Alabama, which has won seven straight recruiting championships to go with those five national titles, still has a chance to sign a top-three class. The top unsigned prospect is Patrick Surtain Jr., a cornerback from Florida whose father played in the NFL. LSU and Alabama are among his choices. ___ Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Alison Foreman,"With Insecure Season 3 as its only binge-worthy newcomer, Hulu has definitely seen better months for TV than August 2018. That being said, its movie selections should more than make up the difference. Classics abound with rom coms including 10 Things I Hate About You and Pretty Woman, sci-fi staples like The Terminator and the Species franchise, and even a few horror meets comedy mashups in Teen Wolf and Shaun of the Dead. SEE ALSO: The fourth and final season of 'UnREAL' is available for bingeing on Hulu right now Make the most of this classic selection during your final days of summer! Check out everything Hulu is bringing on and kicking off its platform this August down below. Top Pick: Get Shorty and Be Cool double feature If you're not well-acquainted with the 1995 crime comedy Get Shorty, you are missing out big time. This John Travolta classic follows the wake of chaos left by loan shark, Chili Palmer, as he attempts to break into the movie business. Classic lines like, ""Have you spoken to Mr. Palmer since your husband blew up?"" and ""Excuse me bro, but who the fuck are you?"" shine throughout. And then, there's Get Shorty 's notably inferior sequel Be Cool, which continues the Chili Palmer cannon. The addition of Uma Thurman, Dwayne Johnson (with hair!), and Vince Vaughn spice things up and make Be Cool worth adding to your classic cinema rap sheet. Both Get Shorty and Be Cool are streaming on Hulu starting August 1st.

"rfitzmaurice@businessinsider.com (Rosie Fitzmaurice), Rosie Fitzmaurice","Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. Alex Macheras 20-year-old Alex Macheras is a broadcast aviation analyst who flies around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even available to the public. He flew on the delivery flight for the Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft on December 13. Says Singapore Airlines' A380 first class suite is the ""hands down winner"" of all the competitors — including Emirates — for several reasons. Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. As a broadcast aviation analyst, he spends his time jet setting around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even open to the public. Last week he took an empty flight from the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France to Changi Airport in Singapore for the delivery of Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft, and shared his experience via his Instagram. Here he is being greeted by the cabin crew ahead of the 13-hour flight. Macheras told Business Insider that on these kinds of trips he spends the duration of the journey examining every aspect of the plane's cabins. ""I'm usually on my hands and knees in the suites testing out what it's like to work on the dining table, use the blinds, dim the lights, etc.,"" he said. His experience sounds similar to YouTube star Casey Neistat's when he took a trip in one of Emirates' newly-launched first class suites its Boeing 777 aircraft. After checking out all of the private cabin's features, Neistat called it the ""all-time greatest airplane seat."" However, Macheras, who has experienced the first class offerings from the likes of Emirates, Etihad, and Cathay Pacific, said there were a number of things about Singapore Airlines' new private suite that make it the ""hands down winner."" Here are the six reasons Singapore Airlines wins, according to Macheras. 1. The bed and seat are separate The core reason Singapore Airlines' A380 first class cabin is ""miles ahead of Emirates'"" is its concept, Macheras said. ""These days 99% of business class cabins feature a big seat that reclines into a fully flat bed — it's so common nowadays — but this suite has a seat and a bed,"" he explained. Alex Machers 2. It's more spacious than a 'central London apartment' The second reason is the space, he said. ""When we talk about spacious cabins in first class, it's usually about how much movement you have in your seat. ""With Emirates first class, it's a small area that is taken up pretty much by the seat, so you can just stand on the spot, but in the Singapore suite there was space to walk around. I'm known for my pacing on the phone — in fact I'm doing it right now — and I found myself pacing during the flight at 43,000 feet."" ""People have tweeted me saying it looks bigger than their central London apartment,"" he added. Alex Macheras 3. It has an understated, elegant style ""With all these airlines offering beds in their first class cabins, they have to differentiate themselves from competitors through the small details and quirks,"" Macheras said. ""Emirates is known for its glitziness and sparkly gold products, whereas Singapore is understated and elegant. It's low-lit like a boutique hotel, which appeals to many more people than the wild lights show of Emirates."" 4. The amenity kits are luxurious Luxury French brand Lalique has designed the new amenity kits as well as the pajamas and bedding for the first class suites. ""The new amenity kits were another thing that impressed me,"" Macheras said. ""But this isn’t just a plush blanket, it’s white crisp Lalique bedsheets that you might expect in a hotel room. The amenity kits are packed with Lalique fragrances, creams, balms, moisturisers, and even a scented candle. 5. The seat has a 'swivel' mechanism so you can face the window Alex Macheras The plush armchair featured in the Singapore Airlines' suite has an electronic swivel mechanism that means you can face any direction you want. ""What's the bonus in having this function? It's something I hadn't considered before I took this flight, but when you fly as much as I do, you've often seen all of the movies on offer,"" he said. Being able to reposition your seat means that you can soak up the views while aboard, he explained. ""When we flew over the Middle East it was 6 p.m. on the ground and the sun was setting and I caught this impressive sunset with so many different tones of orange,"" he said. ""I could just relax and watch it with my headphones in, without getting neck ache."" It also just so happened to be the peak of the Geminid meteor shower while he was on the flight, so while flying over Iran the aircraft was surrounded by shooting stars. ""In the space of about four minutes, I saw about 10 shooting stars,"" he said. 6. There's a 32-inch flat screen TV ""Finally, there's a 32-inch flat screen mounted on the wall of the suite, which is controlled by the tablet and can move left or right — it's like being in someone's living room.""

Loren Grush,"A mission to return a comet sample to Earth and one to explore different parts of Saturn’s moon Titan, to see if it hosts life were selected today by NASA as finalists in a competition for a future robotic mission in our Solar System, part of a program called New Frontiers. The first mission, spearheaded by Steve Squyres at Cornell University, is called CAESAR, or Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return. It will involve sending a spacecraft to comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the same comet recently explored by the European Space Agency, collecting at least 3.5 ounces of samples from the comet’s surface, and returning those samples back to Earth. The mission will collect the organic compounds which constitute the building blocks of life in order to try to understand how comets contributed to life on Earth. “Comets are among the most scientifically important objects in the Solar System but they’re also among the most poorly understood,” Squyres said at a press conference. “I think it’s going to produce groundbreaking science for decades to come.” Photo: NASA CAESAR will return its comet samples to Earth 14 years after launch. The second mission, spearheaded by Elizabeth Turtle at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, is called Dragonfly. It’ll involve sending a helicopter-like robot to the surface of Titan, one of Saturn’s moons. Titan’s considered one of the best candidates for alien life. The Dragonfly mission proposes a so-called dual-quadcopter, which will hop from site to site to take a variety of measurements, including what the surface is made of, how it’s layered, and what the atmospheric conditions are. NASA’s New Frontiers program aims to develop missions to explore planets and bodies in the Solar System. Missions conceived through the program are considered medium-class, meaning they’re not as costly as NASA’s big, multi-billion-dollar flagship missions, like the Curiosity Mars rover. But these missions usually run around $1 billion, making them a little more expensive than the space agency’s smaller Discovery missions — like the Dawn spacecraft orbiting around the dwarf planet Ceres — which hover around less than half a billion dollars. Illustration: NASA An illustration of the Dragonfly lander on the surface of Saturn’s moon Titan. So far, three missions have been created through the New Frontiers program and are currently exploring the Solar System: the New Horizons spacecraft that flew by Pluto, the Juno probe in orbit around Jupiter, and the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which is on its way to grab samples from an asteroid. NASA started accepting proposals for a fourth mission in December of last year, and all submissions had to be sent in by April 28th. The proposals had to follow six different exploration themes that are considered top research priorities by the scientific community: Bring back samples from a comet Bring back samples from the south pole of the Moon Travel to either Titan or Enceladus to understand if these moons of Saturn can host life Figure out the composition of Saturn’s atmosphere Meet up with asteroids in Jupiter’s orbit Study the atmosphere and crust of Venus At the press conference today, NASA also announced the selection of two other mission concepts that will receive technology development funds. One, called Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability, is aimed at developing techniques to keep Earth’s spacecraft from contaminating other worlds. The second, called Venus In situ Composition Investigations, is aimed at improving an instrument needed to study rocks in the harsh conditions of Venus. The comet and Titan mission concepts were chosen by NASA out of a pool of 12 proposals. The finalists will now have a year to keep refining their idea, assessing risks and coming up with a final proposal. NASA will pick the winner in July 2019, and missions will launch by the end of 2025.","A mission to return a comet sample to Earth and one to explore different parts of Saturn’s moon Titan, to see if it hosts life were selected today by NASA as finalists in a competition for a future robotic mission in our Solar System, part of a program called…",2017-12-20T20:37:40Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",NASA picks two finalists for upcoming space missions: a trip to a comet and one to Saturn's moon Titan,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16795076/new-nasa-mission-finalists-new-frontiers-saturn-titan-caesar-comet,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0wVIZx8eWCqCLv2S2qT32zZAjc=/134x0:1376x650/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9906701/caesar_concept.png,the-verge,The Verge,class-1,1
Danny Crichton,"Patreon announced today that it was creating multiple pricing tiers for its membership service, with varying levels of features offered depending on price. The company will now offer a Lite offering that charges a 5% commission, a Pro offering at 8%, and a Premium option at 12%, with discounted rates for existing founders.
Todays announcement is in line with the telegraphs we heard from the company in the deep dive TechCrunch conducted a few weeks ago as part of our first EC-1 package on Extra Crunch. As TechCrunch media columnist Eric Peckham discussed at the time in regards to Patreons fee structure and overall business model:
The problem is, its too friendly. [Patreon CEO Jack] Conte admits that Patreons current fee structure isnt lucrative enough for it to operate profitably as a business: Its not enough. Weve got to figure something else out. This low fee rate comparable more to a payment processor like Stripe than other platforms for creators and fans was the main critique from VCs I talked with as well (both those who invested in the company and those who did not). 
Patreon therefore needs additional revenue streams, and, unsurprisingly, it is already developing them. The company is preparing to offer additional functionality to creators in exchange for a higher cut of their revenue. Conte talks about this as a value for value plan 
While the new fee structure (5%/8%/12%) was expected from Patreon, the scale of the fees are surprisingly low given the messaging Peckham heard at the time. The companys competitors charge significantly more as much as 30% and that leaves a large gap between the startup and the rest of the market.
That said, a huge part of Peckhams thesis and given the new fees, perhaps Patreons as well is that membership is just a stepping stone to other services that will be far more lucrative than just a scrape on transactions. As Peckham wrote:
If membership gains mainstream traction among mid-tail creators and if Patreon (both through its Patreon platform and Memberful subsidiary) secures dominant market share as this market expands, it will be in a powerful position to offer ancillary services that could be quite lucrative. As Jack Conte told me, Membership is Patreons Act 1. Theres so much more we can do to fund the creative class. Youre gonna need more than just membership. Over the next 10 years, theres going to be a lot more that we do.
Peckham noted financial services such as loans, as well as options like health insurance as potentially large categories of value-added services that could make the miserly revenue scrape much more bearable for the company long-term.
Given the importance of Patreon to the creative economy, be sure to read all of Peckhams reports on the companys founding story, product, business, investment thesis, competition, and exit options.","Patreon announced today that it was creating multiple pricing tiers for its membership service, with varying levels of features offered depending on price.

Hoppert: Post 5 has produced the most Derby winners, with an 11.4 win percentage. The last? Pletcher’s Always Dreaming. Hard to bet against that, but work done on his front hooves makes me pause. 6. Good Magic Trainer: Chad Brown Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 12-1 Drape: There’s too much chatter about how good last year’s 2-year-old champion is looking. Those juicy odds may drop precipitously. Hoppert: The Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner has been working lights out here, which has his normally stoic trainer smiling from ear to ear. Hopefully at a nice price, that’s good enough magic for me. 7. Justify Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Mike Smith Odds: 3-1 Drape: This talented colt is trying to do what Bodemeister, Curlin and others have not been able to do since 1882: Win the Derby without racing at 2. I’ll take history. Hoppert: The favorite has won the past five Derbys, but the Santa Anita Derby winner has Apollo’s curse looming over him. Then again, as has been overheard many times this week, he could just be a freak. 8. Lone Sailor Trainer: Tom Amoss Jockey: James Graham Odds: 50-1 Drape: This closer might just clunk up for third or fourth place. Hoppert: The Louisiana Derby runner-up is light on wins (one in eight starts), but he has been drawing some buzz in the mornings. 9. Hofburg Trainer: Bill Mott Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 20-1 Drape: Neither owner nor trainer are the kind to push a lightly raced colt like this one into this deep of water unless he was talented. Hoppert: A long-shot with plenty of upside: a Hall of Fame trainer, blueblood connections in Juddmonte, a second-place showing in a top prep, the Florida Derby, and solid efforts during training. 10. My Boy Jack Trainer: Keith Desormeaux Jockey: Kent Desormeaux Odds: 30-1 Drape: My boy is named Jack. In 2005, three months after he was born, Giacomo won the Derby at 50-1. From this post. I will not make that mistake again. Hoppert: I knew Drape would have a special place in his heart for the third-place finisher in the Louisiana Derby. He has 10 starts, most among a somewhat inexperienced but extremely talented field, but he’s overmatched. 11. Bolt d’Oro Trainer: Mick Ruiz Jockey: Victor Espinoza Odds: 8-1 Drape: He is fast, seasoned and has never run a bad race. He is sitting on a big one. Oh yeah, Espinoza has won this race three times. Here’s your winner. Hoppert: He did not give up in the Santa Anita Derby, and I’m not ready to count him out either, especially with Espinoza aboard. He will likely be a nice price, too. 12. Enticed Trainer: Kieran McLaughlin Jockey: Junior Alvarado Odds: 30-1 Drape: I’m not. Pass. Hoppert: Remember him? He won the Gotham and had people talking, then he finished behind Vino Rosso in the Wood Memorial. 13. Bravazo Trainer: D. Wayne Lukas Jockey: Luis Contreras Odds: 50-1 Drape: Like a few in here, this colt is best running in front. He is going to have a lot of company. Hoppert: Would love to see Lukas, 82, win another Derby, especially for a farm as historic as Calumet, but it won’t be this one. 14. Mendelssohn Trainer: Aidan O’Brien Jockey: Ryan Moore Odds: 5-1 Drape: The European invader by way of Dubai is the most interesting import in the history of the Derby. English and Irish punters will pound him at the betting windows. I will not. Hoppert: He absolutely romped in the U.A.E. Derby, winning by 18 1/2 lengths and setting a track record, in his first start on dirt no less. He has a world-class trainer and jockey, but he just arrived Monday, and the overseas trip will surely take a toll. 15. Instilled Regard Trainer: Jerry Hollendorfer Jockey: Drayden Van Dyke Odds: 50-1 Drape: It is hard to find anything to like about this one. Hoppert: Another horse who is going the wrong way: His last victory was in January, and his speed figures have flattened. 16. Magnum Moon Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Luis Saez Odds: 6-1 Drape: Like Justify, he did not run at 2. If he beats me, he beats me. Hoppert: Undefeated in four starts, he’s definitely dangerous, but I’m not crazy about him drifting wide in the stretch in the Arkansas Derby and, you know, the Apollo Curse. 17. Solomini Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Flavien Prat Odds: 30-1 Drape: Like Flameaway, a tough competitor with a bright future. Don’t see a blanket of roses in it, though. Hoppert: He’s hit the board in all six of his races, but he drew the 17 hole, from which no horse has won, and he doesn’t seem fast enough to compete against this bunch. 18. Vino Rosso Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 12-1 Drape: He needed a weak field in the Wood Memorial to win as a 3-year-old. Hoppert: He seems to be peaking at the right time, and I do put stock in last year’s Derby-winning jockey picking him over Audible. But that was also before he drew this post. 19. Noble Indy Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 30-1 Drape: This colt has been unjustly overlooked. If the Frenchman can get a clean break, this duo might just wire the field. Hoppert: The Louisiana Derby winner is the speediest of the Pletcher bunch, but with that post, he must have a clean break and be able to cut over quickly. That’s a tall task. 20. Combatant Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Ricardo Santana Jr. Odds: 50-1 Drape: This colt has won once in eight starts. Not sure why he is here. Hoppert: One horse has won from the 20 hole, and that was Big Brown in 2008. Combatant is no Big Brown.

BeauHD,"Today, with an update to watchOS, Apple is making its electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) reading feature available to Apple Watch Series 4 owners. It's also releasing an irregular rate notification feature that will be available on Apple Watches going back to Series 1. Both are a part of watchOS 5.1.2. To take an EKG, you open up the EKG app on the Watch and lightly rest your index finger on the crown for 30 seconds. The Watch then acts like a single-lead EKG to read your heart rhythm and record it into the Health app on your phone. From there, you can create a PDF report to send to your doctor. The irregular heart rate monitoring is passive. Apple says that it checks your rhythm every two hours or so (depending on whether you're stationary or not), and if there are five consecutive readings that seem abnormal, it will alert you and suggest you reach out to a doctor. If you have been previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, Apple's setup process tells you not to use the feature. Apple tells me these features are most definitely not diagnostic tools. In fact, before you can activate either of them, you will need to page through several screens of information that try to put their use into context and warn you to contact your doctor if needed. They are also not the sort of features Apple expects users to really use on a regular basis. The EKG feature, in particular, should only really be used if you feel something abnormal going on, and then you should only share the resulting report with your doctor, not act on it directly.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Today, with an update to watchOS, Apple is making its electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) reading feature available to Apple Watch Series 4 owners.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"Republicans are forging ahead with their promise to overhaul the tax code, even with very little public support for their proposal. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) If any group has been convinced by the rhetoric of the Republican tax plan, it’s Republicans. That’s not surprising in one sense. Part of modern American politics is partisans supporting their team. The Republican team is pro-tax-bill, so more Republicans are pro-tax-bill. But in another sense, it is surprising: Despite that partisan loyalty, the tax plan isn’t overwhelmingly popular with Republicans, either. The selling points for the tax bill were that it would result in tax cuts for the middle class directly and benefits to the middle class indirectly by spurring economic growth and job creation from corporate tax cuts. That outside analyses plastered these assertions with various question marks and asterisks was generally ignored by Republican leaders. (For example, even after accounting for growth in the economy, the national debt is expected to grow over the next 10 years by $1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The JCT also estimates that most of the benefit from the cuts would go to wealthy Americans, and most businesses report that they plan to largely invest new cash in stockholders, not employees.) Republicans told pollsters from Quinnipiac University that they agreed with party leaders’ predictions. More than half said they expected the middle class to benefit most; less than a quarter said the wealthy would. Eighty-six percent figured the bill would lead to new jobs and economic growth. Fewer than 1 in 5 thought the bill favored the rich. Interestingly, 55 percent of Republicans figured that the middle class would benefit the most from the bill, while only 27 percent of the actual middle class agreed. Sixty percent of the middle class figured the wealthy would benefit more. Overall, views of the bill were less optimistic. Only 29 percent of Americans told Quinnipiac they approved of the tax bill, the same percentage that approved of the bill in polling from Gallup. The broader context for the bill is that it’s being advocated by a party and a president who themselves aren’t that popular. In August, Americans saw the parties as about even in their ability to handle taxes. In the new Quinnipiac poll, the Democrats gained an 8-point advantage, suggesting that the unpopularity of the bill was dragging down perceptions of the GOP. It’s so unpopular, in fact, that it’s less popular than Trump in both Quinnipiac’s and Gallup’s polls — even among Republicans. In Quinnipiac’s poll, Republicans viewed Trump 15 points more positively than they view the tax bill. In Gallup’s, Trump had an 8-point advantage among members of his own party. So, sure, the Republican rhetoric on the tax bill is echoed by Republican voters. But it’s also the case that fewer than three-quarters of Republicans support the bill in both of the new polls. Trump is relatively popular with his party — and his tax bill less so. This is for a bill that ostensibly cuts taxes. Yet it’s less popular than the most unpopular president in his first year in office in the modern era.","Washington Post Trump's tax plan is still even less popular than Trump Washington Post If any group has been convinced by the rhetoric of the Republican tax plan, it's Republicans.

Gregory Han,"Squint your eyes just a little bit while looking over the appointments and finish of EVA Air’s newly unveiled business class seats, and the automotive design versed might astutely recognize the hand of Bayerische Motoren Werke’s in the design. In fact, the Taiwanese air carrier did partner with BMW, but via the company’s dedicated global aviation team, Designworks, to reimagine the business class experience. As you can see, the partnership has resulted in a highly tailored and contemporary cabin referencing architecture and furniture design. Unlike all too many airline seats even up in business class Designworks has done a commendable job of muted sophistication creating a cabin styled in finishes and textures which should age gracefully. Rich natural leather detailed, lie-flat seating complements the warm color palette of wool carpeting, a design scheme extending to the colors of uniforms worn by flight attendants during meal service. The newly redesigned seats in 1-2-1 layout is being rolled out with EVA Air’s first Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, an experience supplemented with adjustable privacy panels and a newly upgraded In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) systems with a very expansive 18-inch HD touchscreen screen and paired with noise-canceling headphones. We wanted EVAs business class experience to be fresh and memorable for passengers and to make service, design and brand all work together, said Design Director Johannes Lampela from Designworks LA Studio. Our goal was to take a proven seat platform and make it unique to EVA. From privacy, service, interaction, stowage and amenities, we explored the holistic passenger experience. The aim to lure business flyers is strengthened by the seat’s extra-large fold-out tables for dining or work, and a slew of auxiliary outlets and USB ports for staying connected and productive while traveling over oceans. Aesthetically speaking, EVA Air has done well in trusting Designworks to reimagine flying with the some of the same luxurious appointments of a 7 Series sedan.",Designworks partners with EVA Air to redesign the airline's business class flying experience with a highly tailored design scheme referencing architecture and furniture design.,2018-10-05T15:00:09Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Design-milk.com'}",BMW Designworks Drives EVA Air Business Class Toward a Luxurious Finish,https://design-milk.com/bmw-designworks-drives-eva-air-business-class/,https://design-milk.com/images/2018/09/EVA-Air-BMW-Designworks-1-1.jpg,,Design-milk.com,class-1,1
"feedback@businessinsider.com (Mara Leighton), Mara Leighton","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Last night I did my first hot yoga class in a few months, and I found myself laughing out loud about 30 minutes in. Yoga — especially for newcomers and casual goers — can be a uniquely humbling practice. The class, dimly lit and set to throbbing hip hop music, often feels like (and in reality is like) if you joined a dance company and realized at the first practice that everybody else had gotten the routine six months before. You're on a learning curve, and it's only a matter of time before the graceful man in front of you begins to notice that you're just mimicking his every move in order to survive. While I love the practice — the sweat, the challenge, and the wholesome atmosphere — the experience can feel exclusive. And even past that, it's tough to justify an ongoing $20 class fee once you've realized that your inability to correctly execute the poses means you're not getting much bang for your buck. So unless you're willing to shell out $200+ for a 1:1 yoga session, it's going to take quite a few expensive boutique classes before that one yoga instructor for all 30+ people has been able to personally adjust each of your moves. And while the introvert in me wishes it were otherwise, it's not an easy skill to pick up with the help of Youtube videos alone. But, if you're willing to spend $180 on a pair of smart leggings, those frustrations might be a thing of the past. Wearable X — an Australian-born, NYC-based fashion tech company — makes a pair of biometric leggings that vibrate to correct your yoga positions. Known as Nadi X, they bring the corrective touch of an instructor to you without the physical contact or the ongoing class fee. Using tiny haptic multi-node sensors sewn into the nylon layers in the hip, knee, and ankle, your leggings will be able to connect to the Nadi X app on your phone through Bluetooth and communicate about your alignment. The wearer can select multiple poses, and the app provides visual and audio cues that break down the poses step-by-step with corresponding vibrations directly from the leggings. When you forget to lengthen your back or straighten your legs, you'll be alerted with gentle pulses (the intensity of which you can adjust in the app). Wearable X You won't likely bring them along to your hot yoga class, but they will make you more effective in it. Before testing them, I wasn't sure what to expect. Would I be able to decipher what the buzzing meant? Would they look strange and bulky on? In theory, the Nadi X leggings were a great idea. In practice, they're also pretty great. The setup is easy, the app is minimal and easy to navigate, and the leggings are accurate. When you select a position, such as Downward-Facing Dog, the Nadi X app will tell you to bring your hips higher, and the sensors will vibrate along the hips and back to emphasize this. Once you self-correct, the vibrations lessen and disappear. You'll still have to check your phone to decipher what the vibration means in the beginning, but you should grow more and more accustomed to the poses and be corrected (and have to check why you're being corrected) less the more you use them. Overall, the leggings were very accurate. When I broke form slightly, they alerted me. When I broke form to hop up and lounge around without pausing the app, they similarly weren't fooled. In terms of style, the Nadi X leggings look like any other pair of high-end yoga pants. You can order them on Amazon in Midnight (navy) in a solid or with variations like mesh or gray color-blocking or in black &amp; white, and they look just as slimming on as any other pair. You can see slightly raised parts where the technology is embedded, but it is by no means obtrusive. Even after a handwash — which is recommended, though you can throw them in the machine and even tumble dry them without the Pulse attached — the technology still works as promised. Wearable X Some of the obvious downsides are that you won't be getting feedback on your upper body. For me, though, most of my difficulty comes from alignments in my lower body, anyway. You likely won't be cured from the distraction of having to check your phone screen to make sure you're correctly positioned, but it's slower, smoother, and easier to follow than a dimly lit hot yoga room — and you can swipe through as many times as you like without having to pay for another class or pause a video. Once you use them often enough, you can assume you'll need to check less often. You'll also have to continuously charge your pulse, so it's ready to go for your workout, but it's a necessary evil that is justified if you find the leggings themselves useful. They do take a while to charge, though, so do it at night while you sleep. At $180, the Nadi X leggings are almost triple what I normally drop on a pair from Lululemon, but they're also a lot more useful for me personally in the long run. I can maximize my yoga practice at home and later in a class I paid for without dropping the same amount on a one-time personal training session. Plus, with the app, I can refer back and brush up on my skills habitually. If yoga is something you enjoy but the learning curve or expensive classes is not, the Nadi X biometric leggings are a great option for the average user to the frequent yogi who could benefit from a personal (virtual) touch.","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Henry Pickavet,"Ride-hailing, social interactions from behind tiny screens and fitness tracking are just a few of the things we’ve all become accustomed to thanks to innovative app-makers. It’s not often that we think of tech serving society for good. But it’s time we do. Promise, mRelief, Pigeon.ly and Concrn are four companies that, from the start, set out to have a positive impact on society. The heads of these startups have identified issues that plague society and that few people take the time to consider. Bail reform, easier access to food stamps, communication with incarcerated individuals and helping people in need are not sexy issues. But you can utilize tech to try to fix them, and you can hear all about it at Disrupt SF. The issue of bail reform has gained traction in recent years and has been espoused by the likes of California Senator Kamala Harris and Rand Paul, as well as civil liberties groups. That’s because 62 percent of the jail population is behind bars because they can’t afford bail. The premise of Promise is that it serves as a cheaper alternative to incarceration by partnering with counties to monitor the whereabouts of low-risk offenders via an app, rather than keeping them locked up until trial. “People are going to jail because they look at a piece of paper and misread it, or are going to jail because they can’t afford a class because they’re instead paying child support,” Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Promise co-founder, told TechCrunch in March when the company raised a $3 million round led by First Round Capital, with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation participating. Like Promise, mRelief is a service that partners with government. The company’s platform is designed to help cut through bureaucratic tape that can prevent people from accessing important services. Either using a web app or text messaging, users can determine their eligibility to receive food stamp services. Recent updates to the platform now let users in certain locations to go through the entire application process using the web or SMS platform. “Our mission has long been to restore dignity by transforming access to social services,” Rose Afriyie, mRelief co-founder and executive director, told TechCrunch earlier this year. The company has helped more than 230,000 families since launching out of Y Combinator in 2016. Incarcerated individuals are already cut off from society, and when calling friends and family is too cost-prohibitive, it intensifies the isolation. Frederick Hutson, CEO of Pigeon.ly, started the company to help minimize those costs. Hutson, who served four years in prison for drug trafficking, knows all too well the burden this creates. Since the company was founded in 2012, its services have expanded beyond voice. It also allows users to connect to their inmates with photos and letters. In San Francisco, there is an app that allows users to help people in need. Currently available only in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, Concrn was designed to provide an alternative to calling emergency services. If a user sees someone in emotional or behavioral crisis, they can use the app to report it to a trained Concrn Responder. This helps to alleviate stress on the 911 system and prevents people from unwillingly going into the medical system. “Our focus has been to create economic opportunities for people in the Tenderloin community who have previously been marginalized or unable to access employment and also people who have experienced their own mental health crisis in the past,” Neil Shah, Concrn co-executive director, told TechCrunch last year. Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, Rose Afriyie, Frederick Hutson and Neil Shah will be on the Disrupt SF stage in just a few weeks to talk about using technology to effect change in a society that badly needs it. The full agenda is here. Passes for the show are available at the early-bird rate until August 1 here.","Ride-hailing, social interactions from behind tiny screens and fitness tracking are just a few of the things we’ve all become accustomed to thanks to innovative app-makers.

David Schmalz,"Editor's Note: Updates to this story are below the original post. At approximately 1:20pm March 13 at Seaside High, Dennis Alexander, a math and administration of justice teacher who is also a Seaside city councilman and a reserve officer for Sand City Police Department, accidentally discharged his firearm during a gun safety demonstration. According to a statement from Seaside Police, no one was seriously injured in the incident, although Seaside Police Chief Abdul Pridgen says a male student was struck in the neck by ""debris or fragmentation"" from something overhead, and was transported to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula for treatment. He emphasizes that it was not a bullet, and was ""not life threatening."" UPDATE 4:05pm: Monterey Peninsula Unified School District sent out the following statement today to the parents of students in the classroom: ""We want to make you aware of an accident that occurred in the Administration of Justice class today at Seaside High School. As some of you may know, the teacher is a reserve police officer. Today, during class, the teacher accidentally discharged his firearm during a lesson while it was pointed at the ceiling. Debris from the ceiling then fell. Upon learning of the incident, our Human Resources department, school site administration and the Seaside Police Department immediately began investigating the incident, including interviewing students in the class. In discussion with your student, if he/she has information to share that has not already been shared, please direct the student to me. We will also have counseling services available for students. Due to the nature of this personnel incident, we are unable to share any other details. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the on-going investigation. The safety of your student is always our top priority, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our efforts to keep them safe while they are under our care."" UPDATE 5pm: Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante says that Alexander had his last gun safety training ""a little less than a year ago."" He says his department will do an administrative investigation of the incident once Seaside PD completes its investigation. Ferrante adds that Alexander has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of his department's investigation, which will determine if any of the department's policies regarding the safe handling of firearms were violated. UPDATE 5:30pm: MPUSD superintendent PK Diffenbaugh confirms that incident took place during an administration of justice class, a career pathway class that is unique to Seaside High in the school district. He adds that, "" Clearly, we will revisit this incident to ensure that something like this would never happen again."" The administration of justice class has been offered at Seaside High at least since Diffenbaugh came to the district in June 2014, though he adds it has since been expanded to two classes—administration of justice 1 and 2—due to student demand. UPDATE 6:45pm: Diffenbaugh, in a follow up conversation, says it's against state law and district board policy to have a non-authorized individual carry a firearm on campus, and that Alexander was not authorized by the school district to have one. ""We'll need to revisit protocol to make sure all staff members understand that is the policy,"" Diffenbaugh says. Editor's Note 5:30pm: This story has been updated from its original form to reflect that Alexander teaches administration of justice in addition to mathematics.","Monterey County Weekly (blog) Seaside teacher, councilman and reserve officer accidentally discharges weapon in gun safety demonstration.

Phil Nickinson,"As much as $31. That's your estimated worth in the settlement of a class-action lawsuit involving Vizio televisions and the practice of collecting data about what you're watching. And the next time you turn on your Vizio TV, you might find yourself greeted by news of an impending windfall. OK, maybe not quite a windfall, but Vizio TVs (mine, anyway) are starting to show information about the settlement the company entered into over accusations of improperly collecting data on what its customers were watching.
Vizio already had been fined $2.2 million by the FTC for the practice, and in 2018 it reached a $17 million class action settlement, which brings us to today.
The on-screen info gives a high level view of what's up, and how you could go about getting as much as $31 from the settlement. You'll need to have had a Vizio TV connected online between Feb. 1, 2014, and Feb. 6, 2017. And you'll need to sign up at VizioTVSettlement.com.
The $17 million set aside doesn't all go to consumers, however. They'll get what's left after attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses. After that, those who submit claims will be paid out.
Vizio customers have until April 29, 2019 to submit their claim, or to opt-out or object to the settlement.
If you don't do anything, you won't get paid, and you give up your right to sue Vizio for anything surrounding this case.
When you file your claim, you'll be asked to give your name and address, phone number (for payment), email address. They'll also ask for the date your purchased your Vizio TV, as well as the model number, if you know that information. Hit the submit button, and they'll take things from there.

Susan Crawford,"For the past six months, life has been miserable for my dry cleaner. A small business in Greenwich Village, Jerri's (""Cleaning the Village Since 1964!"") has relied on Verizon’s DSL internet access for years. DSL is our era's version of dialup. It's excruciatingly low-capacity: Dialup works by dividing frequencies over a copper phone line, making it slow to transmit information. Because of problems with the wiring running to the building, Jerri’s internet access has been sporadic—often making it impossible to access customer accounts. New York was supposed to be a model for how the modern city could launch high-speed internet for its residents. When the Bloomberg mayoral administration re-signed an agreement with Verizon in 2008, it required that the company wire all residential buildings with its fiber service, FiOS. The agreement was heralded by the press as a way of triggering competition— the presence of Verizon’s fiber product would end the local monopoly of Time Warner Cable, now Spectrum, which provides internet access over a different, lower-capacity wire called hybrid fiber-coaxial. Cable internet access dominates most cities, but it often loses market share to more reasonably priced fiber offerings. The city believed that the new agreement would bring great changes: Every residence could choose between fiber and cable. Verizon, for its part, promised it would finish the job by the end of 2014, and said the presence of its fiber network would cut prices, “promote innovation, and improve the quality of service provided to the people of the City.” That hasn’t happened. Even in the capital of American commerce, competitive options frequently aren't available. Jerri’s is just a single business, but its struggles show the dreadful state of high speed internet access in New York City. The trouble is that New York’s government holds legal power over residential cable television service, not business service. And the agreement left plenty of loopholes for Verizon. At the beginning of last year, Verizon said that FiOS was ""available"" to ""nearly seven million homes and businesses in greater New York City."" But Verizon can pick and choose which businesses are eligible for FiOS, which means that mom and pop outfits, like Jerri’s, can get left out. It's impossible to say how common this problem is across the city; Verizon makes nothing public. A 2015 city audit showed that at least a quarter of the city's residential blocks had no FiOS service. About a third of Bronx residents and more than 60 percent of New Yorkers without a high school education don't have a wire at home. According to the city, one in five New Yorkers doesn't have internet access at home, and the figure rises to one in three for people living under the poverty line. Spectrum's services may be ""available"" to all of those residences, but the prices charged for this utility service are effectively unaffordable to many New Yorkers. Now the City of New York has sued Verizon over the company's failure to wire all of the city's residential buildings with FiOS. Verizon claims that the franchise agreement simply requires it to bring fiber to an intersection near a particular address, rather than to a midpoint on the block where that address is found. The company points to building owners as major obstacles—claiming that the city has failed to help it get its services into buildings. New York City's connectivity woes hold a lesson for other municipalities. But New York City's connectivity woes hold a lesson for other municipalities: Cities need to build or oversee their own ""dark"" (passive) fiber networks to ensure that everyone gets world class, inexpensive data access. (New York City has asked for good ideas aimed at improving universal high speed internet access, and this should be one of those being considered.) Where cities control the blank street grid of fiber reaching every building, they can force competition, low prices, and sterling customer service into the marketplace. Otherwise, your businesses, as well as your residents, will be gasping for air. New York City could be in a very different position today if those Bloomberg officials had called for a city-overseen fiber network. The creation of a neutral, unlit ""last mile"" network that reaches every building in the city, like a street grid, would have allowed the city to ensure fiber access to everyone. It could have been a money-making enterprise: The city might have leased access to that network to a host of competing retail providers, as San Francisco is considering. That would have spurred competition and lower prices for all of the nearly one million businesses in New York City, not just the one-off shiny Silicon Alley virtual reality incubators on which Verizon's press releases are currently focused. Every business needs the opportunities made possible by great, symmetric, inexpensive internet access. When cities don't exercise control or oversight over basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, electricity, or, now, fiber access, they can get stuck with whatever services the private market decides to provide. That has grave consequences. It makes little sense for multiple companies to incur the high upfront costs of installing wires to particular addresses, so markets will inevitably be divided between local monopolies. And companies will pick the most lucrative areas to serve and will leave out poorer households or smaller businesses. Cities end up with high-priced, noncompetitive services that are great for the companies selling them, but not great for public values and overall economic growth. It’s not that Verizon isn’t capable of building such a grid. Times are good for the telecom giant. The Trump administration's tax cuts have lowered its tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which will increase the company's free cash flow for 2018 by $3.5 billion—to $4 billion. That's a stupendous amount of money. Verizon has magnanimously announced it will hand 50 shares of its stock (total value as of February 1: about $2,700) to each of its full-time employees, a gesture similar to John D. Rockefeller's tradition of tossing dimes over the side of his touring car to waiting crowds. Verizon is free, of course, to use its tax windfall however it chooses; the company is likely to pay down debt, buy back its shares to increase their value, and shore up its dividends. Or maybe buy some other company. But the company is under no obligation to use its riches to improve its service—and that’s a problem. The better way forward, by far, is for cities to incur the upfront burden of building infrastructure that allows wholesale fiber reaches every address, and then leasing that access to a host of competitors. Result: inexpensive, world-class data services for everyone. In the end, Jerri's story shows that dense city blocks face the same challenges as rural areas: Under Verizon’s care, we are all being taken to the cleaners.

An Illustrated History of Sex Toys The oldest pleasure object (that we know of) was a siltstone dildo estimated to be about 30,000 years old. Later, others were made of ivory, bone, limestone and even teeth. After their launch, electric vibrators were sold as beauty devices that could help with wrinkles and health issues. It wasn't until the late '60s, thanks to the feminist movement, that vibrators and sex toys were politicized and also embraced as objects that could help women feel empowered about their sexuality. From there came the famous Rabbit, artistic dildos and more. Check out this fascinating history of the sex toy at The Cut. 3.

Steven Dufresne,"Levers are literally all around us. You body uses them to move, pick up a pen to sign your name and you’ll use mechanical advantage to make that ballpoint roll, and that can of soda doesn’t open without a cleverly designed lever. I got onto this topic quite by accident. I was making an ornithopter and it was having trouble lifting its wings. For the uninitiated, ornithopters are machines which fly by flapping their wings. The problem was that the lever arm was too short. To be honest, as I worked I wasn’t even thinking in terms of levers, and only realized that there was one after I’d fine-tuned its length by trial and error. After that, the presence of a lever was embarrassingly obvious. I can probably be excused for not seeing a lever right away because it wasn’t the type we most often experience. There are different classes of levers and it’s safe to say that most people aren’t even aware of this. Let’s take a closer look at these super useful, and sometimes hidden mechanisms known as levers. Levers Are One of the Oldest Mechanisms Archimedes Claw lifting ship. Image source Drexel University Technically speaking, levers predate humanity. You find them in biology — your forearm is a good example which I’ll go into later in the article. When it comes to man made mechanisms, levers are suspected to have been used as long ago as Ancient Egypt for lifting large block and obelisks but the earliest writings of their working principle come from followers of Aristotle and from Archimedes, both dated around 300 BC. Archimedes gave this static description of it: Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights. He also famously said, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.” Putting this into practice, he’s reputed to have devised a defensive weapon called the Claw for fighting off ships attacking city walls. Historical accounts seem to describe a crane sitting on the wall which lowers a grappling hook onto attacking ships and lifts them out of the water, capsizing or sinking them. Lever Principles As shown here, a lever consists of a beam which pivots on a fulcrum. A force, called the effort F e is applied at some distance a from the fulcrum. And a load F l exists at some distance b from the fulcrum. The law of the lever states that: The ratio of the force at the load to the effort force is equal to the ratio of the distances of those forces from the fulcrum. Mathematically, it can be stated as: MA = F l /F e = a/b MA stands for Mechanical Advantage and is a measure of how much the force is amplified. The formula shows that if length a from the fulcrum to the effort is greater than length b from the fulcrum to the load, then the mechanical advantage will be greater than one. Note that we’re not talking about free energy here. The power input is equal to the power output, ignoring losses due to friction, wear, and bending of the lever beam. Power is force multiplied by velocity and they differ proportionately from each other. If a &gt; b then the load will move more slowly than the point where the effort is applied (which must move a greater distance in the same amount of time). Classes of Levers Levers can be arranged in different ways and are described in three classes, all of which follow the law of the lever. Class 1 Levers Class 1 is perhaps the most familiar. Examples of that are a seesaw, a crowbar as well as any time you’ve picked up a stick and placed it on a handy pivot point to lift something heavy at the other end of the stick. A pair of pliers are class 1 levers which we use very often but rarely recognize them as such. Class 2 Levers With a Class 2 lever, the fulcrum is moved to one end of the lever, with the load in the middle and the force at the other end. Every time you pick up a wheelbarrow you use a class 2 lever, with the wheel’s axle is the fulcrum. Class 3 Levers The arrangement of the class 3 lever can be the most difficult to visualize. The fulcrum is still at one end of the lever, but the effort is now in the middle, with the load at the opposite end. It’s harder to think of everyday class 3 examples but we’ll see three of them below. When we look at an exoskeleton arm, a human arm, and a rubber band driven ornithopter wing we’re viewing class 3 levers. James’ Exoskeleton Levers I searched for a great example of a lever in a hacker made project and came up with a great one by our very own [James Hobson]. He built an exoskeleton with arms for lifting heavy loads. Interestingly, each arm contained both a class 1 and a class 3 lever. The arm is actuated by pistons. The main difference between class 1 and class 3 levers is that the load and the fulcrum have been switched. Here you can see that the location of the rear piston creates a class 1 lever, the location of the front piston creates a class 3 lever. You can see him use the rig to curl a 170 pound barbell. Human arm as a class 3 lever. Image source: Robotpark Levers In The Human Body With all its muscles, bones, and joints, it should be no surprise that the human body makes abundant use of levers. However, they’re not always used for mechanical advantage. In the case of lifting a load by raising the lower arm and using the elbow as the fulcrum, the effort is provided by a muscle in the upper arm. This muscle is attached to the lever (the bone) very close to the fulcrum, meaning that a is short compared to b, which extends from the fulcrum to the load in the hand (in the diagram, R stands for Resistance). Therefore the mechanical advantage a / b is less than one. Instead, the benefit here is that a small movement of the bone at the muscle produces a large movement at the hand. This makes for a compact and agile arm which can be useful in tight spaces. A lifting muscle which instead extends from the shoulder to near the wrist would get in the way much of the time. Note that James has done a similar thing with his exoskeleton arm, though he added the second piston to push while the other pulls/lifts. The Ornithopter’s Lever The typical rubber band powered ornithopter has a fuselage running down the middle that acts as the main body to which all the parts are connected. At the bottom of the ornithopter’s fuselage is a crank which is turned by a twisted rubber band. Connecting rods connect the wings to the crank. Turning the crank raises and lowers the wings through the connecting rods. This raising and lowering can be seen clearly in the animated GIF. Looking at the diagrams, the fulcrum is in the middle of the ornithopter, at the top of the fuselage. It’s there where each wing pivots as they flap up and down. The load is actually the air pressing on a wing membrane as the wing is pushed up or pulled down, though my issue was most evident when pushing up. The effort is applied from below, where the connecting rods connect to each wing. The non-obvious lever in my ornithopter turned out to be a combination of two different classes of levers, a class 2 and 3 lever, both of which exist in each wing. Class 2 Lever The class 2 lever is the section from the fulcrum to where the effort is applied by the connecting rod connected to the wing. The load which makes it a class 2 lever is the air pressure on the section of wing extending back between those two points. This fits the definition of a class 2 lever because the load is in the middle, between the fulcrum and the effort. Class 3 Lever The class 3 lever is again formed by the fulcrum and the effort at the connecting rod, but the load is the air pressure on the wing on the side farther from the effort in the opposite direction of the fulcrum. This fits the definition of a class 3 lever because the effort is in the middle, between the load and the fulcrum. Seeing Levers Everywhere So while levers don’t always stand out, they are found in a large number of places. That’s doubtless due to how useful they are. We’d like to hear in the comments below where you’ve used levers or which surprising places you’ve found them in.","Levers are literally all around us.

MARC TRACY,"Brandon Huffman, the national recruiting editor for 247Sports, a high school scouting site, pointed to Rashaan Evans as a vital precedent. A linebacker ranked No. 1 in his high school class at the position, he forsook offers from elite programs where he would have started immediately and chose Alabama, where he did not start until the College Football Playoff of his junior season. After his senior year, Evans was a first-round N.F.L. draft pick in 2018.
Future prospects notice such developments, Huffman said. They see that paying their dues for a couple of years at Alabama and starting only a season or two can be worthwhile down the line.
That, Huffman said, is why Alabama does what Alabama does.
Deionte Thompson, a first-team All-American safety who did not start until his junior season, said he had chosen Alabama because he came from a winning background and did not want to be someplace where I was miserable losing.
I was able to grow so much during the time from me not being a starter to me being a full-time starter now, he said. I wouldnt trade a moment.
Not surprisingly, Clemson, the other dominant program of the College Football Playoff era, also hogs talent, creating depth rivaled only by Alabamas. At the start of this season, Clemson replaced its starting quarterback, a senior who led the team to a conference title and a playoff berth last season, with a freshman: Trevor Lawrence, who by some measures is considered the highest-ranked recruit ever.
Those top programs, youre going to have competition, said Joey King, who was Lawrences high school coach in Georgia. Ive always been leery of coaches who guarantee them a chance to play. Offer them a chance to compete. Thats what Trevor wanted.

Paulina Dedaj,"Authorities in New York arrested a 14-year-old boy on Friday for allegedly vandalizing the memorial of a slain Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor recipient. Suffolk County Police received a call on Thursday that the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Park in Lake Ronkonkoma had been “vandalized.” A picture released by police on Facebook showed that a granite stone with an image of the fallen soldier had been shattered. By 3 a.m. Friday, detectives had arrested the unidentified teen in his home. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took to Twitter earlier to say he was “appalled and disgusted” and promise that the state would pay for the replacement of the defaced plaque. The park, where Murphy was once a lifeguard, was dedicated to him in 2009, on what would have been his 30 th birthday. Murphy was killed while conducting “a reconnaissance mission” in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. He and other members of his SEAL team were “scouting” a well-known terrorist when they were ambushed by an enemy force 50-strong.

Jon Fingas,"The company will sell what's left of its Karma inventory, and plans to continue supporting drones. There are more steps underway to help right the ship. GoPro has cut the price of the Hero6 Black camera from $499 to $399 to spur sales, and chief executive Nick Woodman has cut his cash compensation to $1 for 2018. The company expects to take a $80 million hit for price protection for the just-ended fourth quarter, but the new moves should save GoPro $80 million in expenses for the new year. It's a sad moment for both outgoing staff and for GoPro's hopes of expanding beyond its main business. However, there's no question that the firm faced an uphill battle in the drone space. DJI effectively neutralized the Karma with the more advanced Mavic Pro, and competing drones like AirDog's ADII didn't make life any easier.

Sarah Perez,"Apple announced today a multi-year content partnership with Oprah Winfrey to produce programs for the tech company’s upcoming video streaming service. Apple didn’t provide any specific details as to what sort of projects Winfrey would be involved in, but there will be more than one it seems. Apple shared the news of its deal with Winfrey in a brief statement on its website, which read: Apple today announced a unique, multi-year content partnership with Oprah Winfrey, the esteemed producer, actress, talk show host, philanthropist and CEO of OWN. Together, Winfrey and Apple will create original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world. Winfrey’s projects will be released as part of a lineup of original content from Apple. The deal is a significant high-profile win for Apple which has been busy filing out its lineup with an array of talent in recent months. The streaming service will also include a reboot of Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories, a Reese Witherspoon- and Jennifer Anniston-starring series set in the world of morning TV, an adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation books, a thriller starring Octavia Spencer, a Kristen Wiig-led comedy, a Kevin Durant-inspired scripted basketball show, a series from “La La Land’s” director and several other shows. Winfrey, however, is not just another showrunner or producer. She’s a media giant who has worked across film, network and cable TV, print, and more as an actress, talk show host, creator, and producer. She’s also a notable philanthropist, having contributed more than $100 million to provide education to academically gifted girls from disadvantaged backgrounds, and is continually discussed as a potential presidential candidate, though she said that’s not for her. On television, Winfrey’s Harpo Productions developed daytime TV shows like “Dr. Phil,” “The Dr. Oz Show” and “Rachael Ray.” Harpo Films produced several Academy Award-winning movies including “Selma,” which featured Winfrey in a starring role. She’s also acted in a variety of productions over the years, like “The Color Purple,” which scored her an Oscar nom, “Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” and Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time.” Winfrey also founded the cable network OWN in 2011 in partnership with Discovery Communications, and has exec produced series including “Queen Sugar,” “Oprah’s Master Class,” and the Emmy-winning “Super Soul Sunday. The latter has a connection with Apple as it debuted as podcast called “Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations” and became a #1 program on Apple Podcasts. Winfrey recently extended her contract with OWN through 2025, so it’s unclear how much time she’ll devote specifically towards her Apple projects. Apple also didn’t say if Winfrey will star or guest in any of the programs themselves, but that’s always an option on the table with a deal like this.","Apple announced today a multi-year content partnership with Oprah Winfrey to produce programs for the tech company’s upcoming video streaming service.

More about Leonardo…
Due to backwards compatibility, WordPress hasnt taken advantage of new PHP features released after PHP 5.2.4. Fortunately, WordPress will soon require PHP 5.6+ and even PHP 7.0+ not long after that. This article makes a tour of the PHP features newly-available to WordPress, and attempts to suggest how these can be used to produce better software.
WordPress was born fifteen years ago, and because it has historically preserved backwards compatibility, newer versions of its code couldnt make full use of the latest capabilities offered by the newer versions of PHP. While the latest version of PHP is 7.3.2, WordPress still offers support up to PHP 5.2.4.
But those days will soon be over! WordPress will be upgrading its minimum PHP version support, bumping up to PHP 5.6 in April 2019, and PHP 7 in December 2019 (if everything goes according to plan). We can then finally start using PHPs imperative programming capabilities without fear of breaking our clients’ sites. Hurray!
Because WordPress’ fifteen years of functional code have influenced how developers have built with WordPress, our sites, themes and plugins may be littered with less-than-optimal code that can gladly receive an upgrade.
This article is composed of two parts:
Most relevant new featuresFurther features have been added to PHP versions 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0 (notice that there is no PHP 6) and well explore the most relevant ones.
Building better softwareWell take a closer look through these features and how they are able to help us build better software.
Lets start by exploring PHPs “new” features.
Our new book, in which Alla Kholmatova explores
 how to create effective and maintainable design systems to design great digital products. Meet Design Systems, with common traps, gotchas and the lessons Alla has learned over the years.
Table of Contents →
Classes, OOP, SOLID And Design Patterns
Classes and objects were added to PHP 5, so WordPress already makes use of these features, however, not very extensively or comprehensively: The paradigm of coding in WordPress is mostly functional programming (performing computations by calling functions devoid of application state) instead of object-oriented programming (OOP) (performing computations by manipulating objects’ state). Hence I also describe classes and objects and how to use them through OOP.
OOP is ideal for producing modular applications: Classes allow the creation of components, each of which can implement a specific functionality and interact with other components, and can provide customization through its encapsulated properties and inheritance, enabling a high degree of code reusability. As a consequence, the application is cheaper to test and maintain, since individual features can be isolated from the application and dealt with on their own; there is also a boost of productivity since the developer can use already-developed components and avoid reinventing the wheel for each application.
A class has properties and functions, which can be given visibility by usingprivate (accessible only from within the defining class), protected (accessible from within the defining class and its ancestor and inheriting classes) and public (accessible from everywhere). From within a function, we can access the class’ properties by prepending their names with $this-&gt;:
class Person {
protected $name;
public function __construct($name) {
 $this-&gt;name = $name;
 }
public function getIntroduction() {
 return sprintf(
 __('My name is %s'),
 $this-&gt;name
 );
 }
}
A class is instantiated into an object through the new keyword, after which we can access its properties and functions through -&gt;:
$person = new Person('Pedro');
echo $person-&gt;getIntroduction(); 
// This prints ""My name is Pedro""
An inheriting class can override the public and protected functions from its ancestor classes, and access the ancestor functions by prepending them with parent:::
class WorkerPerson extends Person {
protected $occupation;
public function __construct($name, $occupation) {
parent::__construct($name);
 $this-&gt;occupation = $occupation;
 }
public function getIntroduction() {
 return sprintf(
 __('%s and my occupation is %s'),
 parent::getIntroduction(),
 $this-&gt;occupation
 );
 }
}
$worker = new WorkerPerson('Pedro', 'web development');
echo $worker-&gt;getIntroduction();
// This prints ""My name is Pedro and my occupation is web development""
A method can be made abstract, meaning that it must be implemented by an inheriting class. A class containing an abstract method must be made abstract itself, meaning that it cannot instantiated; only the class implementing the abstract method can be instantiated:
abstract class Person {
abstract public function getName();
public function getIntroduction() {
 return sprintf(
 __('My name is %s'),
 $this-&gt;getName()
 );
 }
}
// Person cannot be instantiated
class Manuel extends Person {
public function getName() {
 return 'Manuel';
 }
}
// Manuel can be instantiated
$manuel = new Manuel();
Classes can also define static methods and properties, which live under the class itself and not under an instantiation of the class as an object. These are accessed through self:: from within the class, and through the name of the class + :: from outside it:
class Factory {
protected static $instances = [];
 public static function registerInstance($handle, $instance) {
 self::$instances[$handle] = $instance;
 }
 public static function getInstance($handle) {
 return self::$instances[$handle];
 }
}
$engine = Factory::getInstance('Engine');
To make the most out of OOP, we can use the SOLID principles to establish a sound yet easily customizable foundation for the application, and design patterns to solve specific problems in a tried-and-tested way. Design patterns are standardized and well documented, enabling developers to understand how different components in the application relate to each other, and provide a way to structure the application in an orderly fashion which helps avoid the use of global variables (such as global $wpdb) that pollute the global environment.
Namespaces
Namespaces were added to PHP 5.3, hence they are currently missing altogether from the WordPress core.
Namespaces allow organizing the codebase structurally to avoid conflicts when different items have the same name — in a fashion similar to operating system directories which allow to have different files with the same name as long as they are stored in different directories. Namespaces do the same encapsulation trick for PHP items (such as classes, traits, and interfaces) avoiding collisions when different items have the same name by placing them on different namespaces.
Namespaces are a must when interacting with third-party libraries since we cant control how their items will be named, leading to potential collisions when using standard names such as “File”, “Logger” or “Uploader” for our items. Moreover, even within a single project, namespaces prevent class names from becoming extremely long as to avoid clashes with other classes, which could result in names such as “MyProject_Controller_FileUpload”.
Namespaces are defined using the keyword namespace (placed on the line immediately after the opening &lt;?php) and can span several levels or subnamespaces (similar to having several subdirectories where placing a file), which are separated using a \:
&lt;?php
namespace CoolSoft\ImageResizer\Controllers;
class ImageUpload {
}
To access the above class, we need to fully qualify its name including its namespace (and starting with \):
$imageUpload = new \CoolSoft\ImageResizer\Controllers\ImageUpload();
Or we can also import the class into the current context, after which we can reference the class by its name directly:
use CoolSoft\ImageResizer\Controllers\ImageUpload;
$imageUpload = new ImageUpload();
By naming namespaces following established conventions, we can get additional benefits. For instance, by following the PHP Standards Recommendation PSR-4, the application can use Composers autoloading mechanism for loading files, thus decreasing complexity and adding frictionless interoperability among dependencies. This convention establishes to include the vendor name (e.g. the companys name) as the top subnamespace, optionally followed by the package name, and only then followed by an internal structure in which each subnamespace corresponds to a directory with the same name. The result maps 1 to 1 the physical location of the file in the drive with the namespace of the element defined in the file.
Traits
Traits were added to PHP 5.4, hence they are currently missing altogether from the WordPress core.
PHP supports single inheritance, so a subclass is derived from a single parent class, and not from multiple ones. Hence, classes that do not extend from one another cant reuse code through class inheritance. Traits is a mechanism that enables horizontal composition of behavior, making it possible to reuse code among classes which live in different class hierarchies.
A trait is similar to a class, however, it cant be instantiated on its own. Instead, the code defined inside a trait can be thought of as being “copied and pasted” into the composing class on compilation time.
A trait is defined using the trait keyword, after which it can be imported to any class through the use keyword. In the example below, two completely unrelated classes Person and Shop can reuse the same code through a trait Addressable:
trait Addressable {
protected $address;
public function getAddress() {
 return $this-&gt;address;
 }
public function setAddress($address) {
 $this-&gt;address = $address;
 }
}
class Person {
use Addressable;
}
class Shop {
use Addressable;
}
$person = new Person('Juan Carlos');
$person-&gt;setAddress('Obelisco, Buenos Aires');
A class can also compose more than one trait:
trait Exportable {
public class exportToCSV($filename) {
 // Iterate all properties and export them to a CSV file
 }
}
class Person {
use Addressable, Exportable;
}
Traits can also be composed of other traits, define abstract methods, and offer a conflict resolution mechanism when two or more composed traits have the same function name, among other features.
Interfaces
Interfaces were added to PHP 5, so WordPress already makes use of this feature, however, extremely sparingly: the core includes less than ten interfaces in total!
Interfaces allow creating code which specifies which methods must be implemented, yet without having to define how these methods are actually implemented. They are useful for defining contracts among components, which leads to better modularity and maintainability of the application: A class implementing an interface can be a black box of code, and as long as the signatures of the functions in the interface do not change, the code can be upgraded at will without producing breaking changes, which can help prevent the accumulation of technical debt. In addition, they can help reduce vendor lock-in, by allowing to swap the implementation of some interface to that of a different vendor. As a consequence, it is imperative to code the application against interfaces instead of implementations (and defining which are the actual implementations through dependency injection).
Interfaces are defined using the interface keyword, and must list down just the signature of its methods (i.e. without having their contents defined), which must have visibility public (by default, adding no visibility keyword also makes it public):
interface FileStorage {
function save($filename, $contents);
 function readContents($filename);
}
A class defines that it implements the interface through the implements keyword:
class LocalDriveFileStorage implements FileStorage {
function save($filename, $contents) {
 // Implement logic
 }
 function readContents($filename) {
 // Implement logic
 }
}
A class can implement more than one interface, separating them with ,:
interface AWSService {
 function getRegion();
}
class S3FileStorage implements FileStorage, AWSService {
function save($filename, $contents) {
 // Implement logic
 }
 function readContents($filename) {
 // Implement logic
 }
 function getRegion() {
 return 'us-east-1';
 }
}
Since an interface declares the intent of what a component is supposed to do, it is extremely important to name interfaces appropriately.
Closures
Closures were added to PHP 5.3, hence they are currently missing altogether from the WordPress core.
Closures is a mechanism for implementing anonymous functions, which helps declutter the global namespace from single-use (or seldom-used) functions. Technically speaking, closures are instances of class Closure, however, in practice, we can most likely be blissfully unaware of this fact without any harm.
Before closures, whenever passing a function as an argument to another function, we had to define the function in advance and pass its name as the argument:
function duplicate($price) {
 return $price*2;
}
$touristPrices = array_map('duplicate', $localPrices);
With closures, an anonymous (i.e. without a name) function can already be passed directly as a parameter:
$touristPrices = array_map(function($price) {
 return $price*2;
}, $localPrices);
Closures can import variables to its context through the use keyword:
$factor = 2;
$touristPrices = array_map(function($price) use($factor) {
 return $price*$factor;
}, $localPrices);
Generators
Generators were added to PHP 5.5, hence they are currently missing altogether from the WordPress core.
Generators provide an easy way to implement simple iterators. A generator allows to write code that uses foreach to iterate over a set of data without needing to build an array in memory. A generator function is the same as a normal function, except that instead of returning once, it can yield as many times as it needs to in order to provide the values to be iterated over.
function xrange($start, $limit, $step = 1) {
 for ($i = $start; $i &lt;= $limit; $i += $step) {
 yield $i;
 }
}
foreach (xrange(1, 9, 2) as $number) {
 echo ""$number "";
}
// This prints: 1 3 5 7 9 
Argument And Return Type Declarations
Different argument type declarations were introduced in different versions of PHP: WordPress is already able to declare interfaces and arrays (which it does not: I barely found one instance of a function declaring an array as parameter in core, and no interfaces), and will soon be able to declare callables (added in PHP 5.4) and scalar types: bool, float, int and string (added in PHP 7.0). Return type declarations were added to PHP 7.0.
Argument type declarations allow functions to declare of what specific type must an argument be. The validation is executed at call time, throwing an exception if the type of the argument is not the declared one. Return type declarations are the same concept, however, they specify the type of value that will be returned from the function. Type declarations are useful to make the intent of the function easier to understand and to avoid runtime errors from receiving or returning an unexpected type.
The argument type is declared before the argument variable name, and the return type is declared after the arguments, preceded by ::
function foo(boolean $bar): int {
}
Scalar argument type declarations have two options: coercive and strict. In coercive mode, if the wrong type is passed as a parameter, it will be converted to the right type. For example, a function that is given an integer for a parameter that expects a string will get a variable of type string. In strict mode, only a variable of the exact type of declaration will be accepted.
Coercive mode is the default. To enable strict mode, we must add a declare statement used with the strict_types declaration:
declare(strict_types=1);
function foo(boolean $bar) {
}
New Syntax And Operators
WordPress can already identify variable-length argument lists through function func_num_args. Starting from PHP 5.6, we can use the ... token to denote that the function accepts a variable number of arguments, and these arguments will be passed into the given variable as an array:
function sum(...$numbers) {
 $sum = 0;
 foreach ($numbers as $number) {
 $sum += $number;
 }
 return $sum;
}
Starting from PHP 5.6, constants can involve scalar expressions involving numeric and string literals instead of just static values, and also arrays:
const SUM = 37 + 2; // A scalar expression
const LETTERS = ['a', 'b', 'c']; // An array
Starting from PHP 7.0, arrays can also be defined using define:
define('LETTERS', ['a', 'b', 'c']);
PHP 7.0 added a couple of new operators: the Null coalescing operator (??) and the Spaceship operator (&lt;=&gt;).
The Null coalescing operator ?? is syntactic sugar for the common case of needing to use a ternary in conjunction with isset(). It returns its first operand if it exists and is not NULL; otherwise, it returns its second operand.
$username = $_GET['user'] ?? 'nobody';
// This is equivalent to:
// $username = isset($_GET['user']) ? $_GET['user'] : 'nobody';
The Spaceship operator &lt;=&gt; is used for comparing two expressions, returning -1, 0 or 1 when the first operand is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second operand.
echo 1 &lt;=&gt; 2; // returns -1
echo 1 &lt;=&gt; 1; // returns 0
echo 2 &lt;=&gt; 1; // returns 1
These are the most important new features added to PHP spanning versions 5.3 to 7.0. The list of the additional new features, not listed in this article, can be obtained by browsing PHPs documentation on migrating from version to version.
Next, we analyze how we can make the most out of all these new features, and from recent trends in web development, to produce better software.
PHP Standards Recommendations
The PHP Standards Recommendations was created by a group of PHP developers from popular frameworks and libraries, attempting to establish conventions so that different projects can be integrated more seamlessly and different teams can work better with each other. The recommendations are not static: existing recommendations may be deprecated and newer ones created to take their place, and new ones are released on an ongoing basis.
The current recommendations are the following:

Think And Code In Components
Components make it possible to use the best features from a framework without being locked-in to the framework itself. For instance, Symfony has been released as a set of reusable PHP components that can be installed independently of the Symfony framework; Laravel, another PHP framework, makes use of several Symfony components, and released its own set of reusable components that can be used by any PHP project.
All of these components are published in Packagist, a repository of public PHP packages, and can be easily added to any PHP project through Composer, an extremely popular dependency manager for PHP.
WordPress should be part of such a virtuous development cycle. Unfortunately, the WordPress core itself is not built using components (as evidenced by the almost total absence of interfaces) and, moreover, it doesnt even have the composer.json file required to enable installing WordPress through Composer. This is because the WordPress community hasnt agreed whether WordPress is a sites dependency (in which case installing it through Composer would be justified) or if it is the site itself (in which case Composer may not be the right tool for the job).
In my opinion, if we are to expect WordPress to stay relevant for the next fifteen years (at least WordPress as a backend CMS), then WordPress must be recognized as a sites dependency and made available for installation through Composer. The reason is very simple: with barely a single command in the terminal, Composer enables to declare and install a projects dependencies from the thousands of packages published in Packagist, making it possible to create extremely-powerful PHP applications in no time, and developers love working this way. If WordPress doesnt adapt to this model, it may lose the support from the development community and fall into oblivion, as much as FTP fell out of favor after the introduction of Git-based deployments.
I would argue that the release of Gutenberg already demonstrates that WordPress is a site dependency and not the site itself: Gutenberg treats WordPress as a headless CMS, and can operate with other backend systems too, as Drupal Gutenberg exemplifies. Hence, Gutenberg makes it clear that the CMS powering a site can be swappable, hence it should be treated as a dependency. Moreover, Gutenberg itself is intended to be based on JavaScript components released through npm (as explained by core committer Adam Silverstein), so if the WordPress client is expected to manage its JavaScript packages through the npm package manager, then why not extend this logic to the backend in order to manage PHP dependencies through Composer?
Now the good news: There is no need to wait for this issue to be resolved since it is already possible to treat WordPress as a sites dependency and install it through Composer. John P. Bloch has mirrored WordPress core in Git, added a composer.json file, and released it in Packagist, and Roots’ Bedrock provides a package to install WordPress with a customized folder structure with support for modern development tools and an enhanced security. And themes and plugins are covered too; as long as they have been listed on the WordPress theme and plugin directories, they are available under WordPress Packagist.
As a consequence, it is a sensible option to create WordPress code not thinking in terms of themes and plugins, but thinking in terms of components, making them available through Packagist to be used by any PHP project, and additionally packaged and released as themes and plugins for the specific use of WordPress. If the component needs to interact with WordPress APIs, then these APIs can be abstracted behind an interface which, if the need arises, can be implemented for other CMSs too.
Adding A Template Engine To Improve The View Layer
If we follow through the recommendation of thinking and coding in components, and treat WordPress as a sites dependency other than the site itself, then our projects can break free from the boundaries imposed by WordPress and import ideas and tools taken from other frameworks.
Rendering HTML content on the server-side is a case in point, which is done through plain PHP templates. This view layer can be enhanced through template engines Twig (by Symfony) and Blade (by Laravel), which provide a very concise syntax and powerful features that give it an advantage over plain PHP templates. In particular, Gutenbergs dynamic blocks can easily benefit from these template engines, since their process to render the blocks HTML on the server-side is decoupled from WordPress’ template hierarchy architecture.
Architect The Application For The General Use
Coding against interfaces, and thinking in terms of components, allows us to architect an application for general use and customize it for the specific use that we need to deliver, instead of coding just for the specific use for each project we have. Even though this approach is more costly in the short term (it involves extra work), it pays off in the long term when additional projects can be delivered with lower efforts from just customizing a general-use application.
For this approach to be effective, the following considerations must be taken into account:
Avoid Fixed Dependencies (As Much As Possible)
jQuery and Bootstrap (or Foundation, or &lt;–insert your favorite library here–&gt;) couldve been considered must-haves a few years ago, however, they have been steadily losing ground against vanilla JS and newer native CSS features. Hence, a general-use project coded five years ago which depended on these libraries may not be suitable nowadays anymore. Hence, as a general rule of thumb, the lower the amount of fixed dependencies on third-party libraries, the more up-to-date it will prove to be for the long term.
Progressive Enhancement Of Functionalities
WordPress is a full-blown CMS system which includes user management, hence support for user management is included out of the box. However, not every WordPress site requires user management. Hence, our application should take this into account, and work optimally on each scenario: support user management whenever required, but do not load the corresponding assets whenever it is not. This approach can also work gradually: Say that a client requires to implement a Contact us form but has no budget, so we code it using a free plugin with limited features, and another client has the budget to buy the license from a commercial plugin offering better features. Then, we can code our functionality to default to a very basic functionality, and increasingly use the features from whichever is the most-capable plugin available in the system.
Continuous Code And Documentation Review
By periodically reviewing our previously-written code and its documentation, we can validate if it is either up-to-date concerning new conventions and technologies and, if it is not, take measures to upgrade it before the technical debt becomes too expensive to overcome and we need to code it all over again from scratch.

Attempt To Minimize Problems But Be Prepared When They Happen
No software is ever 100% perfect: the bugs are always there, we just havent found them yet. As such, we need to make sure that, once the problems arise, they are easy to fix.
Make It Simple
Complex software cannot be maintained in the long term: Not just because other team members may not understand it, but also because the person who coded it may not understand his/her own complex code a few years down the road. So producing simple software must be a priority, more since only simple software can be correct and fast.
Failing On Compile Time Is Better Than On Runtime
If a piece of code can be validated against errors at either compile time or runtime time, then we should prioritize the compile time solution, so the error can arise and be dealt with in the development stage and before the application reaches production. For instance, both const and define are used for defining constants, however, whereas const is validated at compile time, define is validated at runtime. So, whenever possible, using const is preferable over define.
Following this recommendation, hooking WordPress functions contained in classes can be enhanced by passing the actual class as a parameter instead of a string with the class name. In the example below, if class Foo is renamed, whereas the second hook will produce a compilation error, the first hook will fail on runtime, hence the second hook is better:
class Foo {
 public static function bar()
}
}
add_action('init', ['Foo', 'bar']); // Not so good
add_action('init', [Foo::class, 'bar']); // Much better
For the same reason as above, we should avoid using global variables (such as global $wpdb): these not only pollute the global context and are not easy to track where they originate from, but also, if they get renamed, the error will be produced on runtime. As a solution, we can use a Dependency Injection Container to obtain an instance of the required object.
Dealing With Errors/Exceptions
We can create an architecture of Exception objects, so that the application can react appropriately according to each particular problem, to either recover from it whenever possible or show a helpful error message to the user whenever not, and in general to log the error for the admin to fix the problem. And always protect your users from the white screen of death: All uncaught Errors and Exceptions can be intercepted through function set_exception_handler to print a non-scary error message on screen.
Build tools can save a lot of time by automating tasks which are very tedious to execute manually. WordPress doesnt offer integration with any specific build tool, so the task of incorporating these to the project will fall entirely on the developer.
There are different tools for accomplishing different purposes. For instance, there are build tools to execute tasks for compressing and resizing images, minifying JS and CSS files, and copying files to a directory for producing a release, such as Webpack, Grunt and Gulp; other tools help create the scaffolding of a project, which is helpful for producing the folder structure for our themes or plugins, such as Yeoman. Indeed, with so many tools around, browsing articles comparing the different available tools will help find the most suitable one for our needs.
In some cases, though, there are no build tools that can achieve exactly what our project needs, so we may need to code our own build tool as an extension to the project itself. For instance, I have done this to generate the service-worker.js file to add support for Service Workers in WordPress.
Conclusion
Due to its strong emphasis on keeping backwards compatibility, extended even up to PHP 5.2.4, WordPress has not been able to benefit from the latest features added to PHP, and this fact has made WordPress become a not-very-exciting platform to code for among many developers.
Fortunately, these gloomy days may soon be over, and WordPress may become a shiny and exciting platform to code for once again: The requirement of PHP 7.0+ starting in December 2019 will make plenty of PHP features available, enabling developers to produce more powerful and more performant software. In this article, we reviewed the most important newly-available PHP features and how to make the most out of them.
The recent release of Gutenberg could be a sign of the good times to come: even if Gutenberg itself has not been fully accepted by the community, at least it demonstrates a willingness to incorporate the latest technologies (such as React and Webpack) into the core. This turn of events makes me wonder: If the frontend can get such a makeover, why not extend it to the backend? Once WordPress requires at least PHP 7.0, the upgrade to modern tools and methodologies can accelerate: As much as npm became the JavaScript package manager of choice, why not making Composer become the official PHP dependency manager? If blocks are the new unit for building sites in the frontend, why not use PHP components as the unit for incorporating functionalities into the backend? And finally, if Gutenberg treats WordPress as a swappable backend CMS, why not already recognize that WordPress is a site dependency and not the site itself? Ill leave these open questions for you to reflect upon and ponder about.","WordPress was born fifteen years ago, and because it has historically preserved backwards compatibility, newer versions of its code couldn’t make full use of the latest capabilities offered by the newer versions of PHP.

"Steve Garrison steve.garrison@nwi.com, 219-853-2563","CROWN POINT — A man faces charges after his toddler daughter shot her pregnant mother with his gun Tuesday outside Plato's Closet in Merrillville, court documents state. Menzo M. Brazier, 21, of Michigan City, was charged Thursday in Lake Criminal Court with two counts each of criminal recklessness and neglect of a dependent. Police were dispatched about 3:38 p.m. Tuesday to Plato's Closet, 359 E. 81st Ave., for reports of a gunshot wound. Officers found Brazier at the store holding a blood-soaked towel against his pregnant girlfriend's chest, according to court records. The woman had a gunshot wound that entered the upper right side of her back and exited near her collar bone. The woman was transported to Methodist Hospitals Southlake Campus and then Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois, where she was treated in their intensive care unit, records state. She told police in a statement her 3-year-old daughter accidentally shot her with her boyfriend's gun. The father told police his girlfriend was sitting in their vehicle with their children, ages 3 and 1, while he was shopping for pants inside Plato's Closet. He said he did not want to bring his loaded 9 mm handgun into the store, so he put it between the front passenger seat and center compartment. He said he was inside shopping when someone entered the store and said a woman outside was bleeding. He went outside and found his wounded wife leaning against the side of their car. Brazier allegedly admitted the gun was loaded, but claimed a bullet was not chambered. He said he told his daughter not to touch his guns or knives, records state. Brazier was wanted by police on a warrant for failure to appear in Porter County Superior Court on traffic violations, records state. The defendant was arrested on the warrant. He remains held without bond at Lake County Jail, records state.

Quentyn Kennemer,"Battlefield fans rejoice: the series is returning to World War 2, but this time with the power of the Frostbite engine behind it. This should make for the most realistic and action-packed World War 2 multiplayer shooter we've ever seen. Everything you need to know about Battlefield V is straight ahead. What is Battlefield V? We weren't sure which direction DICE would go with Battlefield V after the previous entry - Battlefield 1 - took the series back to its World War 1 roots. With a new mainline entry, we thought the company might look to go with a more modern approach or go a completely different direction with a war they have yet to explore, but it appears they were eager to apply their World War 2 expertise to the new Frostbite engine. Battlefield V will be a familiar game in that regard. It'll be a beautiful first-person shooter that should capture that old wartime feeling like no other. The game will be all about multiplayer, but there's still a bit of fun to be had for those who aren't in it for the competitiveness. Single Player With Battlefield 1, DICE tried something a bit different with their single-player component. Instead of a single lengthy campaign that follows one story that retells the same iconic battles that have been told 100 times, it focused on smaller multiple stories, ones which don't often get the same kind of attention as, say, the D-Day landings in World War 2. Expect that to continue in Battlefield V. We're not yet sure which stories will be told, but if Battlefield 1 is anything to go by then we know they'll often follow individual soldiers or smaller brigades. DICE is likely to use each individual campaign as an opportunity to deliver vastly different gameplay experiences. One might have you marching on the frontlines to storm an enemy foothold, while you might be taking to the skies to dogfight in another. We're also getting a cooperative mode called Combined Arms, a separate set of stories designed to be played with up to four people. Multiplayer As you'd expect, multiplayer will be the bread and butter of Battlefield V. There aren't many games that deliver the level of large-scale that these games do while maintaining a high level of immersion. In typical Battlefield fashion, a mix of infantry and vehicular combat will make for unpredictable and exciting matches. It'll have all the staple elements of the series, including massive maps, tons of players, and destructible environments. You'll do battle on a variety of game modes, including Domination, Conquest, Frontlines, Team Deathmatch and Breakthrough. Grand Operations, an epic, large-scale warfare mode, also returns. Our own Reb Valentine spent time with the mode at E3 2018. As she describes it: Grand Operations is a massive battle that takes place over three days. Your team's success, either as attackers or defenders, will determine your resources on subsequent days, such as troops, ammo, and medkits. On the final day, no one is able to respawn, allowing the fight to determine the ultimate victor of the battle. Battlefield V: Everything you need to know about Grand Operations Fans of Battle Royale games like Fortnite and PUBG will be happy to learn that Battlefield V will have a Royale mode of its own. We're told to expect all the classic tropes of the genre, but with all the stuff that makes Battlefield special. While multiplayer elements mostly remain unchanged - you defend or capture some sort of objective, or simply aim to kill everyone in sight - there is one new mechanic worth pointing out. You can now build fortifications such as trenches, sandbag walls, and barbed wire hazards. Another change is that the revive mechanic can now be used by any class, and you can drag your teammates to safety before going to revive them. Class changes A big part of Battlefield are the various classes you can play as in the game. You have Assault, Medic, Support, and Sniper. The Support player specializes in building fortifications, repairing vehicles, and supplying ammo to teammates. In previous games, the ammo supply mechanic wasn't handy for anything other than replenishing your explosives, as firearm rounds were plentiful. DICE is looking to lessen the amount of starting ammo you get to make the class more meaningful (though players can also pick up extra ammo off of fallen enemies and comrades). You'll be able to build advanced fortifications that other classes can't, such as a machine gun nest. Medics are still focused on healing or reviving allies. Any player can revive a teammate, sure, but that teammate has to be in your squad, and they'll only get a partial health pool on recovery. Only the medic can revive or heal a teammate to full health using their medkit. Their healing action will also be faster, giving you an excellent reason to play the role if you want to keep your squad healthy. DICE hasn't detailed changes to the other two classes, but Snipers are typically only focused on picking off foes from afar and will have a range of tools to keep them safe wherever they decide to hole up. The Assault class, meanwhile, will provide the best balance of firepower and utility. You can customize classes by changing your exact gear, guns, loadouts, and attachments, but there are also new cosmetic customization options that'll let you stand out even more. You can now change your gender, race, add face paint, change clothing, and use cool new headgear. You can also give your vehicles a different look with skins and modifications. Free DLC Battlefield V will have free post-launch DLC, DICE has confirmed. That means new maps and modes will be accessible to all players without the need to buy them individually or buy a season pass. This is a great move that will solve the issue of community fragmentation. DICE plans to make up for the money lost through battle packs, which is their cute name for loot boxes. These should only offer cosmetics for the class customization options mentioned above. Where to pre-order Pre-ordering Battlefield V? You can get an exclusive in-game outfit, special assignments, and five weapons to use right now in Battlefield 1, and if you pre-order early enough, you'll be able to get in on the Battlefield V beta earlier than anyone else. See at Amazon There's an $80 Deluxe Edition, too. You'll get the game three days early for buying this version, as well as more special assignments paratrooper outfits, and 20 weekly airlifts that contain supplies and customization items. See at Amazon When can you play it? Battlefield V launches October 19th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Get the Deluxe Edition to play it three days early, on October 16th.

Christopher Zara,"We know there was mayhem and a lot of characters got shot, but the last time we saw Westworld was in December 2016, which is a really long time ago in the TV-watching universe. After more than 16 months, HBO’s sci-fi epic is finally returning tonight for Season Two. But if you’re like a lot of viewers (including me), you’re going to need a refresher to help you remember where the series left off. I’ve rounded up a few of the best recap options below: HBO’s four-minute recap video: This is probably your best bet. HBO posted a YouTube video that very quickly takes you through the entire season, reminding you about all the major plot points you forgot. Watch it here. Time magazine’s recap : If character-driven explainers are more your thing, this one does a pretty good job of going through each major character and looking at their Season One arc. Read it here. Wikipedia : While the online dictionary is not always the most reliable source, TV synopses on the site tend to be written by rabid fans who know their stuff. Case in point: The Wikipedia page for Westworld ‘s finale includes an editor’s note that says, “This episode’s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.” Exactly what we want to see. Read it here. Reddit : While we’re on the topic of rabid fans, you will not find a more dedicated lot than the redditors on the /r/westworld subreddit. Check it out here. Just re-watch the finale : Not my favorite option since it involves surrendering 90 minutes of your life, but re-watching the entire finale might be the most emotionally satisfying way to get you in the mood for tonight’s premiere. HBO has more information here.","Wait, what happened at the end of the first season again?

"AP, AP","CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees pitcher Luis Cessa made his first game appearance in nearly two months, struggling with his control as he allowed two runs over 1 2/3 innings for the Class A Tampa Tarpons in a 4-1 loss to Philadelphia's Clearwater Threshers on Monday night. Cessa, a 26-year-old right-hander, pitched four innings over three relief appearances in early April, then went on the disabled list with a left oblique strain. In his first outing since April 17, Cessa gave up three hits and four walks, allowing a run-scoring forceout and an RBI single. He threw 19 of 46 pitches for strikes. New York is looking for starting pitching. No. 5 starter Jordan Montgomery had Tommy John surgery last week and Masahiro Tanaka will be sidelined for at least several weeks after injuring both hamstrings running the bases Friday. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,"Lori Trahan, the chief of staff to former Representative Martin Meehan and now an entrepreneur, emphasizes her local roots, hoping that will distinguish her from others who moved into the district to run. “I was born here, I was raised here and I stayed here,” she told voters at a recent debate. “My story is your story.” Another candidate, Dan Koh, who was the chief of staff to Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston, has a slogan (“Let’s go”) and never fails to mention his Korean-Lebanese heritage. But he may be best known at this point for raising more money (and winning more union endorsements) than anyone in this race — an astounding $2.5 million, which is one of the biggest congressional war chests in the country. State Senator Barbara L’Italien has won election several times, but on the stump she emphasizes her role as a mother and advocate for her autistic son, calling herself “a mom on a mission.” In an interview, she said she would be well-served by the fundamentals — name recognition, a geographic base and “an intact machine, a field operation.” From her perspective, a crowded field is good, she said, because it would reduce the amount she had to win by. Mr. Gifford, the former ambassador, who raised $1 billion for President Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012, starred in a reality television show in Denmark called “I Am the Ambassador,” in which he humanized the job of diplomat. On the campaign trail, he tells voters he wants to restore their trust in government. Voters say that sorting out the candidates is like taking a final exam when you haven’t attended class. As a result, many are trudging to events, asking questions, taking notes and comparing and contrasting styles.

Jake Bright,"Bringing small scale Nigerian farmers to a broader market has netted the new startup Farmcrowdy $1 million from investors including Techstars, Cox Ventures and Social Capital. Farmcrowdy’s digital platform connects investors to farmers through sponsorship packages to fund higher yields for a share of the returns. The app allows the sponsors to “Farm Shop” screened agricultural opportunities by produce type, funding amount, contract duration, and expected returns on an investment. The profiles include details on what the sponsorship funds―farm inputs, technical advice, or logistical support―to achieve yields. Common crops are cassava, soya beans, and rice. Investors can also use Farmcrowdy’s platform to track the performance of their sponsorships. “What makes Farmcrowdy different from other platforms is it turns a complex problem into a digital marketplace,” Farmcrowdy CEO Onyeka Akumah told TechCrunch. “We’re taking care of funding for farmers, training for farmers, providing the market for the farmers to sell. We’re taking care of the logistics to move farm harvests to the market and making sure farmers earn a decent return at the end of their cycle,” he said. Farmcrowdy screens small scale farms throughout Nigeria and works with partners such as Syngenta and Africa’s International Institute of Tropical Agriculture to shape sponsorship packages to provide them expertise. A big problem, according to Akumah, is many of the farms do not have the inputs to reach the full harvest potential of their land plots. Farmcrowdy’s revenue model operates on a split system for sponshorships: principal plus 40 percent for sponsors, 40 percent for farmers, and 20 percent for Farmcrowdy. For example, if an investor sponsored a maize farm for 6 months at $1000 and at harvest the produce sold for $1500, the sponsor would regain their investment ($1000) plus 40 percent of profits ($600), the farmer $600 (40 percent), and Farmcrowdy $300 (20 percent). Farmcrowdy will use its fresh funding to scale operations, expand into 20 Nigerian states, and bring more small-scale farmers and sponsors into its program. The startup participated in the accelerator class of one its investors, Techstars, in summer 2017. Techstars vetted Farmcrowdy’s model during a trip to Nigeria earlier in early 2017, Techstars mentor Cody Simms confirmed in an email. Agriculture is yet another African sector in which tech companies are attempting to scale startups, apps, and solutions. MasterCard launched its 2KUZE agtech platform for smallplot farmers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania in January. AgroCenta has developed digital logistics solutions for smallholder farmers in Ghana. Farmcrowdy CEO Onyeka Akumah sees the revenue potential for agriculture in Nigeria “as massive”, noting the country’s size and growth. “Nigeria has 186 million people and is projected to become the world’s third largest country in the next 30 years. All of these people are going to need food to eat,” he said.","Bringing small scale Nigerian farmers to a broader market has netted the new startup Farmcrowdy $1 million from investors including Techstars, Cox Ventures and Social Capital.

Patrick Kulp,"As Amazon's Hunger Games -esque trial to choose the site of its second North American headquarters drags on, a few cities have emerged as clear favorites. A new report from Sperling's Best Places compiles speculation from media outlets, research firms, and brokerages into a definitive ranking of the metropolitan areas most likely to be graced with Amazon's presence. SEE ALSO: Dear Mr. Bezos: Pick Mashable's proposal for Amazon's new headquarters Based on that information, Atlanta is the clear leader of the pack, with Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. close behind. Amazon collected 238 proposals from cities and municipalities across the continent last month after it turned its search for a second stateside base into a contest of sorts. Since then, shameless local leaders have bent over backwards to woo the online shopping giant, even going so far as to sync iconic skyscraper lights with the company's branding or propose a stadium in its honor. Such attention-grabbing spectacles aren't likely to go far towards persuading Amazon in the long run. The company has said it plans to make its final decision based on data around a few key preferences. Those criteria include a metro population of 1 million or more, an international airport within 45 minutes, public transportation, a university pipeline with strong tech programs, and a local culture that matches Amazon's own. Most of the sources from which the latest report pulls take these factors into account. Below is the full list of averaged rankings for each city (the lower the better). Based on those requirements, it's easy to see why Atlanta is a favorite. The 5.7-million-strong population area is home to renowned colleges like Georgia Tech and Emory University and a fast-growing tech scene that could provide the talent needed to fill some of the estimated 50,000 jobs Amazon claims the facility will bring. Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. boast world-class educational institutions, burgeoning tech scenes, and solid public transportation infrastructure as well. Washington D.C. would also be a convenient choice for CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post and recently bought the biggest house in the city. The move would also support the company's recent efforts to beef up its lobbying sway in the nation's capital. The contest is still anybody's game, though, and the consensus is a lot less definitive after the first few top choices.","As Amazon's Hunger Games -esque trial to choose the site of its second North American headquarters drags on, a few cities have emerged as clear favorites.

Nicole Gallucci,"Students, teachers, and faculty members at schools across America are participating in a National School Walkout to take a bold stand against gun violence. After a mass shooting killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14, grieving and distraught teens, families, and citizens began organizing protests to demand Congress take stricter action on gun control laws in the country. On March 14 — the one-month anniversary of the deadly Florida shooting — people of all ages at educational institutions across the country will participate in a National School Walkout. The protest will start at 10 a.m. local time and last for 17 minutes in honor of the 17 lives of those killed in the tragic shooting.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / Dr. Dre performs onstage with Eminem during the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Weekend 1 at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, California. reader comments 1 A federal trademark judge has ruled in favor of a Pennsylvania-based gynecologist who goes by the name Dr. Drai —finding that use of this name does not violate the trademark of Dr. Dre, the famed rapper. The case, which was filed in October 2015 to the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), claimed that Dr. Draion M. Burch's efforts to use the ""Dr. Drai"" moniker in a trademark were a "" close approximation "" of the stage name of Andre Young. Dre's lawyers wanted the Drai trademark, which was first filed in 2011, to be annulled. ""Applicant has admitted that DR. DRAI sounds identical to DR. DRE (Burch Tr. at 154:20-155:1), and, thus, a consumer hearing them would think they are the same. As to appearance, the names look remarkably similar,"" lawyers representing Dre wrote in a November 2017 court filing. ""Both of Applicant's Marks and DR. DRE begin with the terms doctor or the abbreviation for doctor, which are followed by a term that begins with the letters 'D' and 'R' and ends with vowels that make the same sound."" Burch's lawyers, however, countered with the fact that simply because the two names sound similar doesn't mean that Burch is stepping on Young's toes. Under American trademark law, for trademarks to be infringing they have to be at least in a related field and cause confusion in the marketplace. Given that Dre has made a career with hits like ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang,"" while Drai has made a career practicing medicine and self-publishing tips about male and female genitalia, it's very unlikely that a consumer would confuse one for the other. In the end, that's exactly what Administrative Trademark Judge Cheryl Goodman found. ""Although, as we have said, each class of each application is essentially a separate application for which Opposer has the burden to prove likelihood of confusion, Opposer has not directly addressed which of these other goods or services in each class it claims to be related to his goods and services,"" she wrote in a May 3 ruling. ""Opposer submits that confusion is likely because the remaining goods and services 'are offered in non-medical settings to the general public (general interest TV, general-interest radio shows, charity functions, corporate events).' However, the mere fact that Applicant's goods and some of Applicant's services could be offered in non-medical settings is insufficient to warrant a finding that Opposer's and Applicant's goods and services are related."" Still, we'd love to hear a Drai/Dre crossover album. We're slightly less excited about Dre's ability to practice gynecology, however.",Trademark judge finds that no one is going to confuse rapping for medical services.,2018-05-10T11:15:24Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Gynecologist Dr. Drai can use name, even if Dr. Dre doesn’t like it, judge says",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/gynecologist-dr-drai-can-use-name-even-if-dr-dre-doesnt-like-it-judge-says/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-946836714-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-1,1
Frederic Lardinois,"GitLab, the developer service that aims to offer a full lifecycle DevOps platform, today announced that it has raised a $100 million Series D funding round at a valuation of $1.1 billion. The round was led by Iconiq. As GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij told me, this round, which brings the company’s total funding to $145.5 million, will help it enable its goal of reaching an IPO by November 2020. According to Sijbrandij, GitLab’s original plan was to raise a new funding round at a valuation over $1 billion early next year. But since Iconiq came along with an offer that pretty much matched what the company set out to achieve in a few months anyway, the team decided to go ahead and raise the round now. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub earlier this year helped to accelerate those plans, too. “We weren’t planning on fundraising actually. I did block off some time in my calendar next year, starting from February 25th to do the next fundraise,” Sijbrandij said. “Our plan is to IPO in November of 2020 and we anticipated one more fundraise. I think in the current climate, where the macroeconomics are really good and GitHub got acquired, people are seeing that there’s one independent company, one startup left basically in this space. And we saw an opportunity to become best in class in a lot of categories.” As Sijbrandij stressed, while most people still look at GitLab as a GitHub and Bitbucket competitor (and given the similarity in their names, who wouldn’t?), GitLab’s wants to be far more than that. It now offers products in nine categories and also sees itself as competing with the likes of VersionOne, Jira, Jenkins, Artifactory, Electric Cloud, Puppet, New Relic, and BlackDuck. “The biggest misunderstanding we’re seeing is that GitLab is an alternative to GitHub and we’ve grown beyond that,” he said. “We are now in nine categories all the way from planning to monitoring.” Sijbrandij notes that there’s a billion-dollar player in every space that GitLab competes it. “But we want to be better,” he said. “And that’s only possible because we are open core, so people co-create these products with us. That being said, there’s still a lot of work on our side, helping to get those contributions over the finish line, making sure performance and quality stay up, establish a consistent user interface. These are things that typically don’t come from the wider community and with this fundraise of $100 million, we will be able to make sure we can sustain that effort in all the different product categories.” Given this focus, GitLab will invest most of the funding in its engineering efforts to build out its existing products but also to launch new ones. The company plans to launch new features like tracing and log aggregation, for example. With this very public commitment to an IPO, GitLab is also signaling that it plans to stay independent. That’s very much Sijbrandij’s plan, at least, though he admitted that “there’s always a price” if somebody came along and wanted to acquire the company. He did note that he likes the transparency that comes with being a public company. “We always managed to be more bullish about the company than the rest of the world,” he said. “But the rest of the world is starting to catch up. T his fundraise is a statement that we now have the money to become a public company where we’re not we’re not interested in being acquired. T hat is what we’re setting out to do.”","GitLab, the developer service that aims to offer a full lifecycle DevOps platform, today announced that it has raised a $100 million Series D funding round at a valuation of $1.1 billion.

Danny Crichton,"We are in a subscription hell. Paywalls are going up across the internet, at aggregated prices few but Jeff Bezos can afford. The software I used to pay for once now requires an annual tax, because … “updates.” We are getting less every day, and paying more for it, all the while the core openness that made the world wide web such a dynamic and interesting place is rapidly disappearing. I’m not a subscription hater. Far from it: subscriptions are vital, because they provide sustainability to the content and software I care about. Regular, recurring income helps make the business of creation more predictable, ensuring that creators can do what they do best — create — rather than stress about whether the next book or app is going to generate their yearly earnings. Greed, though, has managed to make subscriptions deeply unpalatable. Sustainability has become usurious, with news subscriptions jumping in price and app developers suddenly demanding a fee where none existed before. This avarice for our wallets though is not misdirected. Ultimately, one group of people is to blame for this situation, and it isn’t the bean counters in the accounting department. It’s us. And by us, I mean the proverbial 99% consuming public who refuses to pay for any content or software — except for Netflix or Amazon Prime, of course. Just take a look at the abysmal conversion rates for online content. The New York Times gets 89 million uniques per month, but only has 2.2 million subscribers, excluding crossword and other app subscribers. The Guardian has 800,000 financial supporters, but about 140 million unique visitors at a peak a few years ago. Last year, the Wikimedia Foundation received donations from 6.1 million donors, yet just the English language edition of Wikipedia received 7.7 billion page views last month. That’s 1,300 April page views per annual donor. The implied conversion rates here are in the very low single digits, if not lower. And that’s no surprise given the extreme lengths people go to get content for free. A friend of mine uses AWS to rent IP addresses to reset his article meter on popular news pages, allowing him to download web pages through a Singapore data center using a custom command line utility. Engineers who make hundreds of thousands of dollars are suddenly tantalized by the challenge of trying to break through a porous paywall. I have less technical friends Googling URLs, setting up proxies, and other tactics to get to the same outcome. The problem with these minuscule conversion rates is that it dramatically raises the cost of acquiring a customer (CAC). When only 1% of people convert, it concentrates all of that sales and marketing spend on a very small sliver of customers. That forces subscription prices to rise so that the CAC:LTV ratios make rational sense. What we get then is a classic case of economic unraveling. A company could offer an affordably priced subscription, but users hesitate, and so the company tries to do more marketing initiatives, which raises the cost of the subscription. That makes the vast majority of users even less willing to purchase it, so marketing gets more budget to go after the highest spending consumers. Before you know it, what once might have been $1 a month by 20% of a site’s audience is now $20 a month for the 1%. That’s basically the math of the New York Times. Last year, the company generated $340 million in digital-only revenue from 2.6 million subscribers (including derivatives like crosswords and cooking). That’s $155 a user on average annually, or about $13 a month. The Times had an implied conversion rate of about 2.5% from my earlier calculations. If they could convert 20% at the same sales and marketing cost, they could charge $20 a year and get the same revenue (maybe $22 for added credit card processing fees). The entire subscription economy is ultimately a 1% economy — it’s focused on a very small subset of users who have demonstrated that they are willing to pay dollars for content. The most likely factor that someone is going to buy a subscription is that they already have a subscription to another service. And so we see pricing that reflects this reality. There is a class of exceptions around Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime. Spotify, for instance, had 170 million monthly actives in the first quarter this year, and 75 million of those are paid, for an implied conversion of 44%. What’s unique about these products — and why they shouldn’t be used as an example — is that they own the entirety of a content domain. Netflix owns video and Spotify owns music in a way that the New York Times can never hope to own news or your podcast app developer can never hope to own the audio content market. Yes, we are living in a subscription hell, but it is also heavily a product of our own decision-making as consumers. We want content and software for free, and in fact, we will go to ridiculous lengths to avoid paying for it. We will protest ads and privacy-invasive tracking, but we will never support the business model that would make that technology obsolete. Even when we will consider buying a service, we will wait so long and make the conversion so expensive that a huge chunk of our individual revenue will simply evaporate in sales and marketing costs. The solution here is to become more intentional about aligning our content spending with what we read, use, watch, and hear. Put together an annual content budget, and spend it liberally across the publications and creators that you enjoy. Advocate for pricing that makes sense for you individually, but also convert more easily when you find something that you like. The friction has to lower on both sides of the marketplace for the 20% to supplant the 1%. I don’t want a world filled with gilded walled gardens designed to ensure that the 1% have the best information and entertainment while leaving the rest of us with clickbait fake news and bad covers on YouTube. But creating content and software is expensive, and ultimately, businesses are going to sell to the customers that pay them. It’s on all of us to engage in that market. Maybe then this subscription hell can freeze over.","We are in a subscription hell. Paywalls are going up across the internet, at aggregated prices few but Jeff Bezos can afford.
