Rachel England,"The worm, called ADB.Miner, installs itself as an app called ""Test"" under the package name ""com.google.time.timer"". Once it's infected a device, it eats up resources mining cryptocurrency -- devices will become slow, video playback will stop abruptly and a notification saying ""Test"" with the green Android robot icon will appear randomly on screen. If you've never played around with your Fire TV 's developer options (which are off by default), you'll be safe from the virus. If, however, you've allowed ADB debugging or apps from unknown sources, your device is at risk -- switch both to off. If you suspect you've already been infected, though, there are a couple of things you can do. First up, the tried-and-tested factory reset. But if you can't bear the thought of resetting your device and starting over, AFTVnews recommends downloading the app Total Commander from the Amazon app store, and using it to uninstall the malware directly -- this isn't ideal though, because it's not clear what other changes the malware will have made to your device. Alternatively, you can install a modified version of the malware, which updates the virus to a version that turns off the miner -- again, not ideal, but it appears to have fixed the issue for people who weren't able to remove the malware entirely. This XDA post shows you how, but you should definitely only try this if you're sure you know what you're doing.","If you've loaded any apps onto your Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick that let you watch pirated movies and TV shows, you could be at risk from a cryptocurrency-mining Android virus.

Andrew Liptak,"Amazon appears to have removed support for its gaming controller for its latest Fire TV devices after a recent update, according to AFTVnews. The site (via Engadget ) notes that after a recent software update, a Fire TV 3 won’t be able to find the controller. It also points out that the controller’s product page now says that while the device works with the Fire TV stick, it’s no longer compatible with the Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD - Pendant Design, Fire TV Edition smart TVs, or the Fire TV Cube. However, the site observed that the controller does still work with the Fire TV Cube, and predicts that that functionality might go away in the near future. Earlier generation Fire TVs will still support the device. We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update if we hear back. The site speculates that Amazon might have dropped the controller because of the “complexity of continuing to support the proprietary WiFi-direct connection method,” that it uses, and that the company is shifting focus away from gaming for its TVs. Amazon introduced its gaming controller back in 2014 : it accompanied the company’s Fire TV set-top box that allowed users to stream services like Hulu and Netflix. The device wasn’t designed to supplant an Xbox or Playstation, but could support games that a user could play with the controller.","Amazon appears to have dropped support for its game controller for the latest generation Amazon Fire TVs after its latest update.

GIF Toaster blends the best of both worlds, offering more than enough control over the GIFs you’re trying to create in an interface that’s simple to use and unobscured by ads (if you pay). It’s a must have app on your iOS device and has been praised by users familiar with the apps available for GIF-building. If you ever want to make a GIF with some pro-level tools, or desire more flexibility to customize your creation just the way you want it, GIF Toaster is a more than capable tool. How to Make a GIF GIF Toaster shows you a list of available photos and videos you can use to make GIFs, along with conversion options for different media types like burst shots, live photos, timelapses, and panoramic shots. You can convert your Animoji videos as well if your mug looks particularly funny as a talking dog. It only works with files you’ve got on your iOS device, so no dropping in YouTube links to make clips (use Giphy’s web tool or Mac app for that). Choose your photos or video, hit next, and use the editor to customize your GIF. You can clip the video’s length, choose the frame rate, adjust GIF speed, alter the playback direction, crop the frame, and rotate the video either horizontally or vertically. There are also filters and text banners you can add should you want to put some more flair on your creation. You can even select GIFs already on your device and convert them into videos, still photos, videos, or live photos. What’s more, after you create a GIF, you can see all the relevant stats like framerate, length, file size, and total frames when you check the info tab. If you need to share what’s on your device’s screen, GIF Toaster makes it easy to transform that long recording showing off your skills in Angry Birds 2 into into a short, sweet image that won’t take hours to send compared to its video source material. GIF Toaster is free to use, but paying the $1.99 in-app purchase not only gets rid of the annoying ad at the bottom of the app, but adds features like GIF collage creation, GIF creation with unlimited resolution, and an unlimited number of GIF albums to keep your creations organized. If you want to add weird stickers and overlays to your GIFs, there are other apps available for your customizing pleasure ( consider Giphy, which makes it easy to add hilarious props to your animated creations), but GIF Toaster is by far the most easy to use GIF creation tool I’ve stumbled across, and features more than enough functionality to be my main GIF tool of choice.","Everyone’s using the same app to check Facebook, send tweets, or take pictures.

Beth Skwarecki,"The Camp Fire in northern California has just become the deadliest in the states history; the Woolsey fire in the south is engulfing Malibu; and our president is tweeting obliquely about the logging industry. Welcome to 2018. Everyone from firefighters to the CNN weather guy knows this is wrong, wrong, wrong, so lets break it down: These arent all forest fires The Camp fire did start in a forested area, but the southern California fires did not. As the Pasadena Fire Association replied, these are better described as urban interface firesin other words, ones that start in places where homes are built among flammable vegetation. Wildland fire is a more accurate term, which encompasses brush fires, rangeland fires, and more. So if you imagine nothing but trees burning, youve got the wrong image in your head to start with. There is one big reason for these massive, deadly and costly wildland fires Climate change. We really have to go over this again? Of Californias 10 most destructive fires, nine have been in the last 15 years. Five are from 2017 and 2018. The recipe for these fires requires a few common ingredients : Houses very close to flammable vegetation Dry weather making that vegetation extra flammable High-pressure winds from the jet stream, which occur around this time of year. The hotter California gets, the drier it gets. And the extreme dryness makes the vegetationnot just trees, but also brush and grassesburn more easily. The drier the land, the smaller a spark it takes to catch fire. Then, hot, dry gusts of wind suck up even more moisture, and they push fires forward, throwing embers onto houses and other fuel in their path. Watch this exasperated meteorologist explain it better than I can. President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires Read more Read Forest management may be a dog whistle for the logging industry Politicians including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have been advocating for fuels reduction management. The thinking seems to be: remove the forest, and you cant have forest fires. In effect, this means opening up lands to logging. But, as Outside explains here, logging isnt effective at removing the kinds of fuel that wildfires thrive on. Loggers want to take the biggest, most commercially valuable trees, and leave the saplings and brush. Guess what catches fire really well? Yeah. Saplings and brush. Funding is necessary for preventing fires and helping affected communities Its not clear what federal funding you could remove from the picture and make fire management better. Much of the area thats burning is federal land anyway. And until 2020, the US Forest Service still has to cannibalize its own fire prevention budget to find the money to put out fires that are already burning. (The practice, called fire borrowing, was finally ended with a bill that Congress passed earlier this year.) Putting out wildfires costs more every year, as fires get worse. Just another exciting aspect of living in 2018.",The Camp Fire in northern California has just become the deadliest in the state’s history; the Woolsey fire in the south is engulfing Malibu; and our president is tweeting obliquely about the logging industry.

Jacob Kleinman,"Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices and Kodi ’s semi-legal media player software have been a popular combination for years. With that in mind, you may be eyeing one of those new “ Fire TV Edition ” television sets from Element or Westinghouse, which run the company’s TV operating system right out of the box. But before you make your purchase, it’s worth checking to see whether Kodi runs as easily on these TVs as it does an Amazon’s Fire Stick. Thankfully, the answer is yes, though the installation process is a little different than what you may be used to. What’s Kodi? If you’ve never heard of Kodi or you’re not sure what it is, here’s a quick overview: Kodi is open-source software that runs on everything from Raspberry Pi to Android (which is what powers Amazon’s Fire TV software). Kodi makes it easy to play your own movies, TV shows, and other media on almost any device. It also supports a wide variety of plugins that offer access to torrented movies, live TV and even let you play old video games. That’s where Kodi sometimes runs into trouble, and it’s why you can’t just download it from Amazon’s app store like you normally would. But that hasn’t stopped people from finding other ways to get the software running on their Fire TV devices, and these new televisions are no exception. If you cut the cord to save money but miss your favorite cable channels, Channel Pear is here to… Read more Read How to Install Kodi on your Fire TV Edition One of the most common ways to get Kodi on a Fire TV device is with ES File Explorer, but that won’t work on these new televisions. After finding that the old method wasn’t an option, The Streaming Advisor tried out a few other methods that can get the job done. The first thing you’ll want to do is download an app called Downloader from Amazon’s app store. We’re using it because it has a built-in browser that you’ll be navigating for the rest of the process. Once Downloader is installed and ready, open it and head to kodi.tv. Select the Android version of Kodi. On the next screen click on the 32-bit option and download it. When that’s done (it may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed) hit install and you’re done. If that doesn’t work, The Streaming Advisor also has a couple other suggestions. Check them out in the video below, which also covers the process outlined in this article.","Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices and Kodi ’s semi-legal media player software have been a popular combination for years.

Sarah Perez,"Amazon is bringing “hands-free” access to Alexa – a feature currently found on its flagship Fire HD 10 tablet – to the rest of its Fire tablet line, the company announced this morning. Starting this week, owners of either the Fire 7 and the Fire HD 8 (2017) will be able to launch Alexa using their voice, whenever the tablet’s screen is in use or the device is connected to power. While Alexa has been available on Amazon’s devices for some time, it wasn’t until the Fire HD 10 arrived that Alexa could be used in a hands-free mode. Now that same functionality will roll out to Amazon’s other tablets through a free, over-the-air software update. Once enabled, device owners will be able to talk to Alexa without touching their tablet – asking her to do things like play a song, turn off the lights, start or pause a movie, check your calendar, control your smart home (including viewing video from connected cameras or doorbells) and more. The feature essentially turns the tablet into a poor man’s Echo Show, the $230 Echo device with a screen. Of course, there are some drawbacks to Alexa on tablets. The speakers aren’t as good as a full-sized Echo, and tablets don’t have the mic array you’d find on an Echo, either. But being able to say “Alexa,” is a familiar experience for users who expect to be able to talk to a device’s virtual assistant hands-free, as they can with Siri or Google Assistant on other devices. But because the Fire 7 or Fire 8 HD device has to either be connected to power or have the screen on, it’s a better option for using the tablet as a smart display, rather than a full replacement for an Echo that works anytime. Amazon says the feature is rolling out this week.","Amazon is bringing “hands-free” access to Alexa – a feature currently found on its flagship Fire HD 10 tablet – to the rest of its Fire tablet line, the company announced this morning.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/ robot dog from burning my house down ?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with spring water, here are the steps you should follow to properly extinguish a battery-related fire (and why you should save that Pellegrino as a last resort). Smartphone Fire? Unplug It First A smartphone battery fire is only made worse if that smartphone is drawing on another power source while it burns. When your battery starts to hiss or bulge, be sure to unplug it from whatever power source it’s connected to before you turn your attention to extinguishing. Start With a Fire Extinguisher Safety first means being prepared for emergencies like fires, caused by your smartphone’s self-immolating battery or otherwise. That means you’ll need a fire extinguisher, so add one to your shopping list. In terms of fire extinguishers, you should have one designed to put out Class B and Class C fires. Class B fires involve flammable liquids and gases, while Class C fires involve electrical equipment like motors and batteries. Your standard fire extinguisher, costing anywhere from $35 to $80, should be able to handle Class A, B, and C fires. There are a variety of extinguishers available, but searching for a Class ABC extinguisher will yield one appropriate for dowsing your new Pixel 2. If you’re on a budget, you can snag smaller fire suppression canisters that are both cheaper (anywhere from $20 to $40) and smaller than a standard fire extinguisher. In late December, Galaxy Note 8 owners started to report a bizarre issue with the phone’s battery.… Read more Read Class D fire extinguishers are also available, but are designed to extinguish fires involving combustible metals. While you can certainly use one to put out your smartphone, a class D fire extinguisher’s high price tag might put it a bit out of your reach, so don’t bother spending the hundreds of dollars required to get one. Water or Sand Works in a Pinch Thanks to the chemical composition of smartphones powered by lithium batteries, there is always the chance that pouring water on a smartphone could cause a chemical reaction between the H2O and lithium metal, turning that hydrogen into fuel for the fire. Fortunately, most smartphone batteries have such little lithium the risk is pretty negligible. Should you find yourself dealing with a smartphone fire armed only with a six-pack of seltzer, feel free to apply it liberally, and drown your smartphone until no more smoke is visible. Needless to say, your phone is toast. You can dispose of your charred battery by searching for a battery disposal location near you. If your iPhone decides to blow up at the beach, you can also cover it in sand or other non-flammable smothering agent like dirt. As with most things that burn, be sure to avoid inhaling the fumes from a smoking battery, as they’re toxic, carcinogenic, and just plain gross.","After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/robot dog from burning my house down?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with…",2018-01-15T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How to Extinguish a Battery Fire,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-extinguish-a-battery-fire-1822040010,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--GAb-KedI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/glkvfwub9nefofh69zoj.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,fire,1
Sarah Perez,"With little fanfare, Amazon launched its Silk web browser for Fire TV, allowing users with Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Fire TV Edition televisions to surf the web from their big screen. The app offers several standard web browser features, like the ability to search or enter URLs, access bookmarks, move forward or back, save passwords, and more. It also uses Bing.com as the default search engine, and supports searches via voice, thanks to its integrations with Fire TV’s voice remote. Overall, however, the browser is a fairly bare bones app that doesn’t seem like it was carefully customized for use on a television’s screen. But then again, browsers aren’t really a great app for use on TVs in the first place. The cursor, for example, moves around via the directional buttons on the remote. That’s functional, but obviously more cumbersome than just grabbing your phone (that’s probably nearby anyway) to perform a search or load a webpage. But the point of the Silk browser for Fire TV is not really web searches – it’s for online video. The app includes a section of content called “Trending on the Web,” which highlights popular videos, including those from news sources like CNBC, CNN, Fox and others. You can play, pause, fast forward and rewind these videos using the buttons on the remote, instead of the cursor, which makes for easier viewing. The app’s release was first spotted by AFTVNews, which pointed out the beta version of the Silk browser had leaked this June, hinting that a launch was in the works. Above: image credit, AFTVNews Amazon has not yet formally announced the app’s arrival, nor has it yet responded to requests for comment. It could be the company is tied up with its re:Invent conference in Vegas, or it may be waiting until the browser is fully compatible with all Amazon Fire TV devices before making an announcement. Currently, the app works on the 1st and 2nd generation Fire TV devices, the 2nd generation Fire TV Stick, and all versions of Element and Westinghouse’s Fire TV Edition televisions, according to AFTVNews’ report. But it has not yet launched on the new Fire TV, possibly because that device runs the new Fire OS 6.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A new satellite image of our planet shows fires raging across the world, from Canada to Australia to South America to Sub-Saharan Africa. But despite its striking appearance, much of this is actually quite ordinary. The map, created by NASA, denotes fires with red dots, based on heat measurements that detect fires. While it may look like the world is alarmingly aflame, fires occur every year. It’s the unusual intensity of fires in certain regions, linked to human-caused climate change, that we need to worry about. Here’s the uncropped image: “Pretty much wherever you have vegetated surface, you have fire. I don’t particularly think this is a crazy, out-of-the-ordinary year for the globe,” said Christine Wiedinmyer, associate director for science at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, a partnership between NOAA and the University of Colorado, Boulder. But it’s a particularly big year for certain parts of the globe, she told Gizmodo. The parts where many of our readers live: “The Western U.S., California, and British Columbia—it’s a super big year.” You’ll notice that many of the data points appear in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. These fires appear annually and come mostly from slash-and-burn agricultural practices common in the region. These methods clear fields and replenish the soil nutrients, but can also produce human-harming smoke. Many of the fires in Brazil and Indonesia are also due to these farming methods. NASA has a neat tool showing how fires burn across the globe over time that you can play with here, demonstrating the annual nature of Saharan, Sub-Saharan, and Indonesian fires. But in some years, like 2015, these practices led to forest fires that severely impacted air quality and led to a haze in the region. Studies have suggested that the El Niño weather patterns made 2015 especially bad. This context is crucial to understanding a map like this. The fires are really bad, yes, but you need more than a map to explain why. Take the fires in North America, as well as in many parts of South America—they are wildfires. You’ve likely heard all about the fires on the North American West Coast, many of which have been sparked by people and aggravated by the compounding effects of dry weather, winds, and high heat. A recent study demonstrated that south-central Chile is facing many of the same climate-related concerns, along with intense fires of its own. Another huge wildfire sparked up south of Berlin, Germany just today, causing evacuations. The AP reports that these fires have been complicated by buried ammunition from WWII blowing up. Germany has faced an especially hot and dry summer. You can expect climate change to exacerbate the conditions that cause these fires in the future, especially in places where the human population is expanding. “We know that the climate really drives fire activity severity, particularly in the western U.S.,” Wiedinmyer said. These fires can have global impacts too, sending smoke across the ocean to Europe or up to the poles, she said. So, you shouldn’t be surprised that there are so many fires on Earth. But you should be worried about the increase in wildfires, which we can expect will continue to worsen during our lifetimes. And you should be really worried about people who deny humanity’s very real and often dangerous impact on the environment.

Sarah Perez,"Amazon is giving its Fire TV Stick an upgrade. The company announced today it will now ship the Fire TV Stick with the new version of the Alexa Voice Remote launched last fall. The remote allows users to control other devices besides their Fire TV, thanks to its support for both Bluetooth and multi-directional infrared. However, the upgraded remote won’t impact the Fire TV Stick’s price, which remains $39.99.
The new Alexa remote was arrived alongside the $49.99 Fire TV Stick 4K in October. It’s capable of controlling the TV, soundbar and other AV equipment, and can do things like switch inputs or tune to a channel on your cable box. As a standalone purchase for older Amazon Fire TV devices, the remote was retailing yesterday for $29.99. But today, Amazon is slashing the price by 50 percent, it says.
The voice remote also includes the ability to speak to Alexa with a press of a button, which can help you find shows and movies, control smart home devices, get the news and weather, stream music and more.
Amazon notes the inclusion of the next-gen remote makes the Fire TV Stick the only streaming media player under $40 that includes a remote capable of controlling other AV equipment besides the TV. This could be a selling point for Fire TV Stick versus Roku, whose high-end voice remotes are focused on controlling power and volume on TVs, or its own Roku wireless speakers.
At CES this year, Amazon said its Fire TV platform as a whole had now topped over 30 million active users, which seemed to put it just ahead of Roku’s 27 million. By swapping in a better remote with the flagship Fire TV Stick device, Amazon is looking to solidify its lead gained by steep discounts on its devices over Black Friday and the larger 2018 holiday shopping season.
The updated Fire TV Stick will also be the first to ship with Amazon’s just launched, free streaming service IMDb Freedive included. Announced at CES, the service offers a range of free, ad-supported movies and TV shows – a challenge to its rival’s service, The Roku Channel. It will come to other Fire TV devices by way of a software update.

Jacob Kleinman,"Amazon is making it even easier to control your Fire TV without straining yourself with the use of a physical remote. After adding the ability the control your television through an Echo speaker over the summer, the company announced an update on Thursday that adds even more voice-based controls across even more streaming apps. Starting now, you can control Bravo, CBS All Access, Hulu, NBC, Showtime and Sony PlayStation Vue. That’s in addition to all the apps that already work with Alexa voice controls like Netflix, Prime Video and HBO NOW. To watch a specific show on any of those apps, just say something like “Alexa, watch Star Trek Discovery ” or “Alexa, play The Handmaid’s Tale ” or whatever else you want to watch. If you pay for Hulu’s live TV option or PlayStation Vue, you can also use Alexa to switch between channels supported by those services with commands like “Alexa, go to ESPN” or “Alexa, tune to FOX.” Once you pick a show or movie, you can still use Alexa to control what’s happening on screen. Just use one of these phrases to navigate what you’re watching without ever picking up the remote (let alone actually getting off the couch): “Alexa, pause.” “Alexa, fast-forward.” “Alexa, fast-forward 5 minutes.” “Alexa, rewind.” “Alexa, rewind 5 minutes.” “Alexa, play.” “Alexa, next episode.” “Alexa, last episode.” “Alexa, start over.” “Alexa, play from the beginning.”","Amazon is making it even easier to control your Fire TV without straining yourself with the use of a physical remote.

Nitasha Tiku,"A big pension fund and an activist investment firm Thursday said they had filed shareholder proposals pushing Facebook and Twitter to take more responsibility for managing content on their platforms, including mistreatment of women, fake news, election interference, violence, and hate speech—in other words, the same issues that have kept social-media giants in the crosshairs for the past year. The resolutions were filed by New York State Common Retirement Fund, the nation’s third-largest public-pension fund, with assets of more than $200 billion, and Arjuna Capital, an activist-investment firm known for pressuring companies in tech, banking, and retail to pay men and women equally. The proposals accuse both companies of responding to concerns with inadequate disclosures and content policies that “seem reactive, not proactive.” The resolutions are the latest sign that concerns about potential ill effects spawned by a handful of giant technology companies have moved from Washington to Wall Street. On Sunday, a pair of activist investors — the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the hedge fund Jana Partners — targeted Apple with a public letter urging the company to address a growing body of research that smartphones can harm children’s mental and physical health. In a response, Apple promised new tools for parents, and said, “We take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.” Jana Partners’ role in the highly publicized letter took some by surprise because the hedge fund usually wages those kind of public campaigns to restructure companies, not crusade for social issues—a sign that financially focused investors believe concerns about smartphone addiction in children could affect Apple’s bottom line. Unlike the letter, the shareholder resolutions filed Thursday come with a legal obligation for the companies to respond. They aim to force votes by the companies’ shareholders at their upcoming annual meetings. But the companies may ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow them to exclude the proposals, requests that the commission was more inclined to grant last year. Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Thursday’s resolutions are revised versions of shareholder proposals that Arjuna Capital filed in October, wiith Illinois State Treasurer. But the addition of the New York pension fund adds significant heft to their demands. Michael Connor, executive director of Open Mic, a nonprofit group that uses shareholder engagement to increase accountability at media and tech companies, says past attempts to engage with Facebook have not been fruitful. Illinois’ treasurer, for example, could only get a 15-minute phone call. “They don’t seem to sense any real accountability to outside stakeholders. They will humor you, there will tell you that they respect your opinion, but they don’t take you seriously,” he said in an earlier interview with WIRED. Connor dismissed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent statements that the company is adding employees to review content, which may impact profits. “If they say we’re going to add another 3,000 employees, you have to ask yourself why 3,000 and not 4,000? We don’t know. We have no idea what the most influential social-media player in the world thinks is necessary to come up with a responsible product,” Connor says. In Thursday’s proposals, shareholders are asking Facebook and Twitter for reports assessing whether the company’s own terms of service agreements have been effectively enforced and information about the risk to the company’s finances, operations, and reputation posed by their policies and “content management controversies.” On a conference call with reporters, Patrick Doherty, co-director of corporate governance for New York State Patrick DiNapoli, who is a trustee of the state pension fund, mentioned traveling to Russia a few years ago and talking to people about what life had been like under the communist regime. “After awhile, they just tuned out Pravda,” because a lot of it was misinformation or disinformation. “That’s our major concern that people are going to lose faith in these platforms in the long term.” Activist shareholders have successfully lobbied for change on issues like climate change, but only after years of pushing the issue. It’s not clear if investors can exert influence over the super-platforms that dominate the stock market. That’s particularly true at Facebook, where Zuckerberg owns a controlling share of voting stock, giving him effective veto power over any shareholder resolution. Pat Tomaino, director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management, says his firm and pension funds like CalSTRS have pressed tech companies on similar long-term concerns like bullying and the hostile environment for women and underrepresented minorities online. By getting involved before these issues hurt a company’s financial performance, investors can “help companies avoid punitive policy action but also make their products and platforms more robust and creative in the future,” he says. But when it comes to the negative health impact of devices like smartphones, Kristen Strader, campaign coordinator for the nonprofit group Public Citizen, says there are limits to what industry can solve. Government intervention may be necessarily. “We should absolutely see the [Federal Trade Commission] stepping in and addressing the advertising on social media and the [Federal Communications Commission] addressing some of the issues on data collection,” she says. “The problem is bigger than people are on their phones because they want to be on their phones.”","Activist investors filed shareholder resolutions asking Facebook and Twitter to take more responsibility for content on their sites, highlighting how concerns about the power of big tech firms is moving from Washington to Wall Street.",2018-01-11T18:52:47Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Facebook, Twitter Under Fire From Activist Investors",https://www.wired.com/story/investors-join-calls-for-facebook-twitter-to-take-more-responsibility/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a579934f41e4c2cd9ee6d4a/191:100/pass/GettyImages-477454662.jpg,wired,Wired,fire,1
Joe Ray,"Deep-fried turkey is an exciting Thanksgiving menu sub-genre, bringing new flavorsand risk!to the traditional holiday feast. To fry a turkey in the now-classic way, you hook a propane tank to a large, stand-alone burner, heat a giant vat of oil on top of it, then rely on arm strength to lower your bird into the scalding oil and hope to not make a splash. It cooks remarkably quickly and some people swear by the crisp skin and juicy meat, but damn, there are some downsides, not the least of which is that they're dangerous enough to have spawned their own sub-genre of flaming-turkey-fryer disaster videos. So when Cuisinart put their name on what had been a Waring fryer after Waring dumped their consumer line in 2014, I was intrigued. Their Extra-Large Rotisserie Fryer and Steamer is essentially a large, electric countertop frying vessel where only the bottom third is filled with oil. You lower a bird on a spit into the box and a set of gears constantly rotates the spit, meaning only the lower third or so of the turkey is in the fry oil at any time. You can also remove the spit, switch over to a basket, and use the setup as a traditional deep fryer. If you do a bit of frying, especially turkey frying, you may already see how clever this all is. You'll immediately catch on to the safety angle. Instead of wishing you had a derrick to lower the turkey into the oil, here you enclose it in a basket on the spit, grab the spit with a handle and lower it into a ""labyrinth""a back-and-forth channel the ends go through to prevent dropping the bird and splashing hot oil on you and your loved ones. Speaking of splashing, once it's in there, you'll happily notice that since the oil is only in the bottom third of the ""cooking space"" (as they call it), splattering during cooking isn't a problem; I make more of a mess cooking up a stir fry. When I pulled it out of the box for a Saturday afternoon testing session, I realized how huge it is. At about five cubic feet, it easily became the largest countertop appliance in my kitchen, dwarfing my microwave. But hey, turkeys aren't tiny! Once it's in the oil, you don't need to do anything for the hour or hour and a half until it's done. Setup is pretty easy. I filled the bottom of the oil container up with about five liters of oil (about a third as much as in a good-sized traditional turkey fryer), plugged it in, and twisted the knob to set the temperature. While the oil heated, I prepped my turkey, primarily by making sure it was patted dry and had no residual frozen bits lurking in the cavity, either of which will cause a frothing storm of oil bubbles. Working over a sheet pan, I set the turkey on the spit, which has a built-on basket to keep the legs and wings from flopping around, and fed it through the labyrinth and into the oil. I cringed needlessly, then flipped the rotisserie switch and walked away. And that, right there, might be the Cuisinart fried turkey's greatest feat: Once it's in the oil, you don't need to do anything for the hour or hour and a half until it's done, at which point you just turn off the rotisserie for a moment and check the temperature at the breast and thigh. This is considerably easier than in a traditional fryer, where one member of a couple might lift the bird out of the oil and hold it in the air (often directly over the hot oil) while the other takes the temperature. The really good news: my turkey came out great. With a purpose-built machine like the Cuisinart, I'd be disappointed if it didn't, but this was a crowd-pleasera nice, juicy bird with crispy skin. It also cooked up in less than an hour and a half, easily twice as fast as oven-roasting. However, this is the part where we run into all sorts of freighted preconceptions and thoughts about deep-fried turkey's superiority and, you know, Thanksgiving. While deep frying makes a great birdand again, mine was very good!it is by no means the best turkey I've ever had. I'm a fan of a dry brine and wet roast methods, but any well-made oven bird can go toe-to-toe with a deep-fried turkey. My secret theory is that the biggest fans of the deep-fried method may never have had a great oven-roasted turkey. I tested that theory on Boston Globe food writer Devra First, who has written about deep-fried turkeys. While she didn't disagree, she also brought up a good point: ""Frying turkeys appeals more to the tinkerer/experimenter/hobbyist/special event cook,"" she says. And hey, if that gets more people cooking, then bravo! Tinker away! It's also going to transform the lovely smell of a roast bird into a generic fried-food smell, which will permeate your house long after your Thanksgiving guests leave. Two days after I fried my bird, my bath towel smelled like fry oil. What I realized in further testing is that due to its size and that smell, the electric Cuisinart fryer might be best stored and used in the garage. If, like me, you live in a smaller place, it might not be for you at all. It's not Cuisinart's fault, but frying at this scale is also noisy. When I made the turkey before my guests arrived, it made enough frying noise to drown out the radio. Finally, gravy making becomes a completely independent exercise as there are no drippings. This is too bad, because I had a lot of fun with it. For instance, while the turkey rested, I took advantage of the hot oil and fried chicken I'd already cooked sous vide. (A perfection-chasing method where all you're doing in the fryer is turning the batter into crispy, fried goodness.) The next day, I indulged my budding fascination with the Japanese pork cutlets known as tonkatsu. These two recipes alone made a compelling argument for having a deep fryer in my kitchen. Here's why: When I deep fry without a dedicated fryer, it involves my Dutch oven, a thermometer of some form poking out of it, a ton of oil, and a struggle to keep that oil at the temperature where I want it. Fry nights are special occasions, so there are usually family and friends and screaming children over while I have to give 100 percent of my attention to what I'm cooking. While traditional turkey fryers have you trying to manually manage the temperature of the oil, the Cuisinart allows you set it to the temperature you want it. I dropped the first round of fried chicken in the oil, cracked a brewski, and shot the breeze with my brother-in-law Ben until it was done. With 1800 watts of power, it brings the oil up to temperature quickly and holds it well. When food goes in and the temperature drops, the Cuisinart gooses the heat, making my tonkatsu a surprisingly quick lunchtime option. Ben, who has worked in restaurant kitchens in the past, took one look at it and immediately pronounced, ""That thing's legit!"" It's worth noting here that oven-top temperature control is slowly becoming a reality with top-notch products like Breville's Control Freak burner or Hestan's new built-in induction stove, helping to simplify frying. One fairly pleasing discovery with the Cuisinart fryer was cleanup. The ""cooking space"" and the heating element took a while to thoroughly clean. That said, there's a cleverly recessed spigot right on the bottom front of the machine, and a little hose that attaches to it, making pouring off the oil 100 times easier than with a classic turkey fryer or Dutch oven, where that process might be referred to as a turducken. The Cuisinart Extra-Large Rotisserie Fryer and Steamer is an excellent, purpose-built machine that isin my mindthe smartest way to fry a whole bird. It makes a great turkey and, as long as you're cooking a bird that's 14 pounds or less, does it with much less risk than traditional turkey fryers. If you like having access to a near professional grade deep fryer and love fried turkey, this is the safest and smartest way to make it at home.",The Extra-Large Rotisserie Fryer and Steamer handles a whole bird with far less risk of an oil fire.,2018-11-04T13:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Cuisinart Extra-Large Rotisserie Fryer and Steamer Review,https://www.wired.com/review/review-cuisinart-extra-large-rotisserie-fryer-and-steamer/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5bdc93fbcacf35399586ee92/191:100/pass/turkeyfryer.jpg,wired,Wired,fire,1

Jeffrey Van Camp,"Last autumn, I recommended the 2017 Fire HD 8 and named it the best of Amazons bundle of affordable tablets. Its sequelthe 8th generation of Fire tablets, for those keeping countis still dirt cheap and completely functional, just a little less fun to use. Unless you're using Alexa. The new Fire HD 8 is pretty much the same, inside and out, as last years model, and the 2016 model before that. Its a travel-sized 8-inch (1,280 x 800 pixel) glass screen cradled by a cheap-feeling though somewhat durable plastic that you can buy in all three basic colors, and black. Amazon even placed a tiny lip around the edge of the screen to help prevent cracking or scratching if you drop it. Like previous 8-inch Fires, the screen still tends to attract fingerprint gunk more than other tablets, though you get used to it fairly quick. Most of the buttons and connectors are on the top, if you hold it vertically, like a book. Theres a volume, power, an audio jack, and a microUSB for chargingtypical stuff that you'd find on a phone. No matter how familiar I get with the Fire tablets, I still have to feel around for the volume keys sometimes, and get them confused with the similarly-shaped power button. Its not a deal-breaking annoyance, but it becomes a quirk of the ownership experience. Amazon has also included a MicroSD slot again, which will come in handy for long vacations or trips. You can now save movies and other media to cards up to 400GB. A 64GB card should be more than enough space to download what you want. The selfie camera also technically got an upgrade this year. Its a 2-megapixel unit now, up from 0.3 MP (also known as VGA resolution). It joins the 2-megapixel camera on the back. Both exist mostly to sit and go unusedthey dont take good photos and arent particularly great for video calling eitherbut they are there and can theoretically do these things, which is sorta the point on a tablet this affordable. Amazon and Alexa Above All The Fire HD 8 ticks off most must-have features for a tablet, and like other Amazon devices its entire interface is centered around serving you the best content Amazon (and Amazon Prime) has to offerbooks, videos, music, magazines, all of itand if you get to know the interface, youll figure out how to find other apps on Amazons own Appstore. That means you can nab games like Candy Crush and popular apps like Facebook and Netflix. Thanks to hands-free Alexa, you can now talk to Amazon's digital assistant from across the room, or put the tablet in Show Mode to turn it into an Echo Show-type device. (Amazon made a special Echo dock to help you.) It works well, and is a cheaper and more flexible option than buying a smart display. The Fire HD 8s speakers can play music decently loud, toonot as clearly as many dedicated smart displays, and sometimes tinnier, but if music isnt your top concern, its a fun setup. When you arent using it as a makeshift Echo, the Fire HD 8 begins to show its age and limitations. It may still be functional, but this Fire seems slower, with more lag, freezes, and jitters when youre navigating menus and opening apps. The battery life is also a couple hours shorter than last year, thanks to (guess who?) Alexa. Amazon hasnt upgraded the main processor, graphics, RAM, or almost anything else inside the Fire 8 in several years. It has finally upgraded its Android-based system to Googles 2016 Android 7.1which may be causing some of that extra lag. It could also be the Special Offersads that show on the homescreen. You can pay $15 to eliminate these, and you should consider it. Theyre more distracting and have more obvious ""Buy"" buttons than they used to have. Its a little grating when your tablet starts to try and sell you apps and items this blatantly. The new generation of ads comes as almost all of Amazons other apps, and the entire Fire OS interface remain stuck in a rut. The design is still kind of confusing and basic Amazon apps like Maps and Camera arent up to snuff with what youd get on a many of our favorite tablets. The selection of games and apps on Amazons store is also still quite limited compared to what youd find on other tablets. There is Another For $80, the Fire HD 8 is a usable tablet that plays a few games, has books, and lets you watch movies and TV shows. For older kids that wont destroy it immediately by throwing it at the wall, it's a great pick. Your children can handle a little lag, and Amazon's system lets you enforce parental controls very easily. If youre buying for an adult, especially yourself, consider at least saving up for Amazons Fire HD 10 (without Special Offers) for $165. Its faster, has more storage, and the 10-inch HD screen looks much nicer. Pair it with a standing case or Show Mode dock and youll be a happier camper. The Fire HD 8 remains one of the best deals in tech. Just know, before you press that 1-Click button, its budget price comes with some sacrifices.","Amazon's Fire HD 8 is still incredibly cheap, but it's not the bargain it once was.",2018-10-14T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Amazon Fire HD 8 (2018) Review: Affordable but Underwhelming,https://www.wired.com/review/review-amazon-fire-hd-8-2018/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5bc0e70e6278de2d21234897/191:100/pass/Fire-HD-8-Side-SOURCE-Amazon.jpg,wired,Wired,fire,1
Sarah Perez,"Apple Music is launching on Amazon Fire TV in the U.S. today, after rolling out in December to Amazon’s Echo line of smart speakers. The news is notable as it’s yet another example of the eased tensions between the two rivals following Apple CEO Tim Cook’s 2017 announcement of Apple’s agreement with Amazon. Their deal allowed Amazon’s Prime Video app to launch on Apple TV and saw the return of Apple products on Amazon.com.
Since then, the companies have made several moves to honor their deal.
Last year, for example, Amazon expanded its assortment of Apple inventory to include other devices beside Apple TV – like iPads, iPhones, Apple Watch and Beats headphones. It also brought its FreeTime Unlimited app to iOS. And most recently, Apple Music arrived on Echo.
Now it’s coming to Amazon Fire TV, too.
The launch will allow Apple Music subscribers the ability to access the streaming service’s catalog of 50 million songs just by asking Alexa. Users can request songs, artists, playlists and albums, by saying things like “Alexa, play today’s hits on Apple Music,” or “Alexa, play music by [artist’s name] on Apple Music,” for example.
On Fire TV Cube, Apple Music can also be streamed within multi-room music groups.
To use Apple Music on Fire TV, you’ll have to enable the Apple Music skill and link your account. (Those who had already done so in order to listen on their Echo device won’t need to do this again.)
Amazon isn’t the only company benefiting from Apple’s decision to shift more of its company’s focus to subscription services – like its streaming music offering and, soon, its streaming video service.
Apple also recently announced a partnership with Samsung to bring iTunes content to Samsung Smart TVs through a dedicated app, and related deals with TV makers like Vizio and LG to support AirPlay. It’s said to be working on a similar deal to get AirPlay supported on Roku.
Apple Music is available to U.S. Fire TV owners starting today.
Amazon says Apple Music support will roll out to both Fire TV and Echo users in the U.K. in the weeks ahead.","Apple Music is launching on Amazon Fire TV in the U.S. today, after rolling out in December to Amazon’s Echo line of smart speakers.

As with its predecessors, the new tablet is essentially a Fire HD outfitted with a bumper, software for kids and parents and a two-year “worry-free guarantee.” Amazon says it’s “built from the ground up for kids,” which isn’t really true — though that’s perfectly fine. The important thing is that you’re getting decent enough specs for a low price. At $200, it’s a $50 premium over the standard 10-inch Fire. Given all of the stuff the company is bundling in here, however, Amazon says you’re essentially getting a $120 discount, when all is said and done. The device once again ships with a year of Amazon FreeTime unlimited, bringing 15,000 books/movies/apps/games to the device. Using that, parents can limit and track screen time on the device, assuring that kids are using the device to read an actual book, in addition to various other media consumption. The newer, larger kids tablet will be available in blue, pink or yellow. It’s up for pre-order today and starts shipping July 11.","After the launching of the Fire HD Kids Edition 7, customers asked for a larger version, so Amazon announced the Fire HD Kids Edition 8.

Chris Velazco,"While the Fire Phone was a punchline and a commercial failure, it did lead to good things — eventually. In a conversation with Engadget at CES, Sandeep Gupta, Amazon's Technical Program Manager for Fire TV, suggested that the teams and processes built to make the Fire Phone reality also made possible the impressive hardware ecosystem we now see. ""Building the phone was sort of a trial by fire,"" Gupta said before groaning at his pun. ""It was a very intense product, and we learned so much. And the teams we built from the Fire Phone have helped seed a lot of the other teams. You'll see people on the Echo team, the TV team, the tablet team who got their start on the Phone team."" If Amazon's teams learned a lot, it's because they needed to achieve a lot. The Fire Phone wasn't Amazon's first hardware project; a handful of Kindles came before, not to mention a few Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes. But the Phone presented fresh technical challenges for Amazon to grapple with. ""The phone is, without a doubt, one of the hardest working hardware products you can build,"" Gupta said. ""They're very compact. You've got antennas, you've got an ecosystem, you've got an app store, you've got content services, you've got the whole kit and caboodle."" It didn't help that the Fire Phone was designed to be more complex than rival smartphones from the get-go. Four front-facing sensors tried to track the motion of user's heads so some of the images that appeared on-screen would move with them. And since the Fire Phone was intended to be a kind of concierge for Amazon's massive online store, we got Firefly : a feature that allowed people to scan everyday objects around them for identification and eventual purchase. That's one hell of an undertaking, but Amazon powered through despite a relative lack of experience. Along the way, Gupta says, Amazon was forced to figure out the intricacies of small-scale hardware design, not to mention more efficient ways to work with chipset vendors and manufacturers. Amazon also had countless other questions to answer. How do you define your product? What are the milestones in development to work toward? While the answers to those questions weren't complete, they were enough to prepare Amazon to do better in the future. ""The engineering excellence was there,"" Gupta said. ""That's what continued to flow through the organization and allowed us to get to where we are."" If Amazon had learned those lessons sooner, the Fire Phone might not have turned out the way it did. Still, even though it languished on store shelves, the Fire Phone itself wasn't a bad device. The hardware was expensive but functional. The software was overly ambitious, but it was impressive when it worked. Amazon (perhaps wisely) decided not to use its refined understanding of the development process to build another phone, but Gupta is adamant that the company's ""trial by fire"" made subsequent devices like the Echos and the improved Fire TVs better. ""We took those learnings and now we've been able to apply them to a lot of the other products we're building,"" Gupta said. ""And sometimes you learn what to do by learning what not to do.""

Emily Dreyfuss,"Fire doesn’t heed history. It doesn’t care about posterity or culture or memory. Fire consumes everything and anything, even if that thing is the last of its kind. On Sunday night, it came for the National Museum of Brazil, burning for six hours and leaving behind ashes where there had been dinosaur fossils, the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas, and audio recordings and documents of indigenous languages. Many of those languages, already extinct, may now be lost forever. It’s the kind of loss that’s almost impossible to quantify. For the researchers who worked in the museum, the conflagration sent their life’s work up in smoke. “It is very difficult to react to reality and try to return to life,” linguist Bruna Franchetta, whose office burned down in the fire, told WIRED in an email. “At the moment we do not know the extent of the destruction of the Documentation Center of Indigenous Languages in the National Museum. We have to wait a long time for a survey of what is left in the middle of the rubble. At the moment I can say nothing about what has not turned to ashes, but I hear colleagues saying that it was all lost.” It didn’t have to be this way. All of these artifacts could have been systematically backed up over the years with photographs, scans, audio files. The failure to do so speaks to a vital truth about the limits of technology: Just because the means to do something exists technologically doesn’t mean it will be done. And it underscores that the academic community has not yet fully embraced the importance of archiving importance of archiving—not just in Brazil, but around the world. Though Franchetta says work had begun recently to digitalize the CELIN archive, she has no idea how far it had gotten, and it focused on only a part of the collection. “The loss is immense, and much of what has been destroyed by the flames can never be recovered,” she says. In 2018, when an iPhone automatically backs up every photo you take, you might think knowledge is safer today than it was in the days of the Library at Alexandria. The fire in Brazil puts the lie to that assumption. To undertake the archiving of so vast a collection—the National Museum of Brazil reportedly lost 20 million artifacts in all—requires time, money, and a sense of urgency. As museum staff and researchers try to pick up their lives, find a new offices to work in, and figure out how to continue their work, there's plenty of blame to go around. Much of it belongs at the feet of the Brazilian government, which had slashed the budget for the National Museum and the University of Rio De Janeiro, which runs it. The museum was so strapped for money that last year, after termites destroyed a wooden base holding a 42-foot dinosaur skeleton, it started a crowdfunding campaign to raise $15,000 to replace it. The building had no sprinkler system. Government cuts are also why, when firefighters arrived to fight the flames Sunday night, they reportedly found no water in the hydrants, having instead to get water from a nearby lake. 'It is very difficult to react to reality and try to return to life.' Bruna Franchetta, Linguist All this austerity—fallout, reports say, from the vast spending on the World Cup in 2016—both made the fire more likely and made it burn more fiercely and longer than it needed to. Brazil’s cultural minister said that before the fire struck the museum, it had been poised to receive $5 million from the government for upgrades, including adding a fire suppression system. But the lack of a backup archive goes beyond governments. Certainly funding played a huge part, but even scholars who spend their lives studying history and loss, researching how cultures end, can fall for the notion that there will always be more time. “I think people just had the idea that, well it can be done someday, what’s the urgency?” says Andrew Nevins, a linguist affiliated with the National Museum. “The idea of digitizing as an urgent priority wasn’t in the air...Instead there was lots of funding and sources for going into the field and finding the last speakers right now of [a given language].” That’s obviously important work, but without a plan for how to safely back up and keep those records, much of it is now lost. That loss is not merely to science, or to future museum visitors, but to those cultures who entrusted their histories to the museum. An estimated 500 indigenous tribes currently live in the Amazon, speaking around 330 languages, about 50 of which are estimated to be endangered—but before colonization there were likely as many as 2,000 tribes. The CELIN archive contained research into roughly 160 of these languages, estimates Franchetta. Linguist Colleen Fitzgerald, who heads the United States’ National Science Foundation’s project on protecting endangered languages, notes that field work of the type that created the collection in Brazil involves deep collaboration with the communities being studied. Often over the course of many years, researchers gain access to people’s lives, stories, and customs. The responsibility to protect what they share is a solemn one. “Brazil [does not have] a diffuse culture of file safeguarding, especially through scanning and storing in various backups and in different secure locations,” says Franchetta. She notes that their academic community rarely discusses best practices in how to create digital archives. Nevins agrees. Though students and professors labor to collect everything they can about endangered languages, he sees far less emphasis on protecting what they gather. “The first reaction that many of us had was indignation: How could this happen, how could there be no sprinkler system? But I think as the dust started to settle there’s also some indignation at the state of library science in Brazil,"" says Nevins. ""Why isn't library science in Brazil at a place where digitizing existing materials is as important as going out and collecting stuff?” Brazil is no outlier. Troves of important linguistic and anthropological collections exist in museums small and large, in institutes and universities in every nation, each with different budgets and practices around digital archiving. In fact, so many collections are at risk of loss due to catastrophes like fire or floods that just last month the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property held a simulation to train people in how to save precious artifacts after a crisis. Though the ephemerality of material knowledge concerned researchers for years, only recently have international standards for digital archiving emerged. Fitzgerald notes that the NSF, the biggest funding agency for science in the US, only instituted archiving data management requirements for work it funds in 2011. An international consortium dedicated to digitizing endangered languages, The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in Nijmegen, Germany, created a group that runs a central digital archive in 2000 into which researchers can upload their linguistic field work. The group also funds archival work around the world; Franchetta says the National Museum in Brazil had received funding from them for some of its digitization work. And in 2003, different linguistic groups concerned with endangered languages formed the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network, a consortium dedicated to digitizing the diffuse linguistics archives around the world. Though it has a handful of member organizations across the world, none are in South America. 'I think people just had the idea that, well it can be done someday, what’s the urgency?' Andrew Nevins, Linguist Even when the decision does get made to archive a language, it comes at a tremendous cost. Just this year, the Archive for Indigenous Languages of Latin America, a DELAMAN member run by the University of Texas at Austin, finally digitized a collection of proto-languages from Latin America—among them Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, and Uto-Aztecan—based on more than 100,000 documents, 900 CDs of audio recordings, and hundreds of boxes of field notes taken by renowned Mesoamericanist Terrence Kaufman. The project took six years, with full time work from professors and graduate students, and specialized equipment. It was only possible through a $302,627.00 NSF grant awarded in 2012. That figure is more than twice the reported annual maintenance budget of the entire National Museum, which was reportedly $128,000—though this year it only had received $13,000, total, according to National Geographic. The collection in the linguistics wing of the museum alone was far larger than 100,000 documents. To digitize it all properly would have required not just buy-in from the powers that be, but also expensive specialized tools, like noninvasive scanners than can salvage audio recordings from the wax cylinders used a century ago to gather interviews. And that's just the equipment. Someone has to watch the tape to make sure it doesn’t skip. Someone has to mark the metadata that makes it possible to search through a digital archive. “Someone’s got to sit there while it’s being digitized. There’s human labor just in that process.” says Fitzgerald. That can be a graduate student or undergrad, notes Nevins, though some specialized equipment requires technicians with specific skills. Fitzgerald recently awarded a grant to a team in Hawaii that will work to make more advanced automated archival tools that might make this process easier—and, crucially, cheaper. Much of the work digitizing cultural artifacts has always been a labor of love undertaken by dedicated individuals in their free time. A group like this had worked for years scanning small parts of the most important collection that burned on Sunday, known as the Curt Nimuendajú collection. Nimuendaju was a German linguist at the turn of the 20th century who recorded hundred of hours of Amazonian languages that are now extinct. Two linguists in Brazil run the group Etnolinguistica as an homage to his work. Though their website contains some scans of his documents, it is far from a comprehensive archive of his primary sources. ""They’re an impressive group that scans stuff all the time but it’s not institutional at all,"" says Nevins. ""It’s just a bunch of people, a bunch of web denizens who go scanning stuff."" In the aftermath of the fire, many crowdsourced campaigns have sprung up. Franchetta says the CELIN department has put out a call to any researchers and students who ever photocopied anything from the collection to please send copies back to the National Museum. “But that's a drop in the ocean,” she says. Academics from all over the world have been amplifying calls to share any photographs or recordings taken inside the museum in an effort to rebuild. Wikipedia put out a similar call. The spirit of collaboration and a sense of the community coming together in a time of crisis is palpable. But it can’t replace what’s been lost. “My will, with the anger that we are all feeling, is to leave that ruin as memento mori, as memory of the dead, of the dead things, of the dead people, of the archives, destroyed in that fire,” Brazil’s most famous anthropologist, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, who was affiliated with the museum, told a newspaper in Portugal this week. The global academic community, and the researchers in Brazil, hope that memento mori provokes an awakening about the urgent need to digitize the world’s knowledge. If fire comes for another historically important collection, maybe then it won’t take the world’s knowledge with it.

Ellen Airhart,"The red imported fire ant is one of the worlds most invasive species. Its sting delivers a burning poison that kills living tissue. Together groups of ants devour deer fawns, baby birds, reptiles, and almost any other source of protein they can get their mandibles on. They form acres of crisscrossing tunnels with thousands of cooperative workers. And their territory has steadily been spreading.
The fire ants story is in some ways the opposite of what the insect world as a whole is experiencing. Measuring bug populations is an imperfect sciencetheyre small, mobile, and hidden. But they are undoubtedly shrinking, due to habitat destruction, climate change, and other human-driven trends. A German study found a 75 percent decline in insect biomass between 1989 and 2017. Another German study found that the butterfly population decreased from 117 species in 1840 to 71 species in 2013. And a 2014 Science review found that of the invertebrate species that are actively being monitored, the majority have decreased by almost half.
But for the fire ant, this mass die-off is a blessing. They are experts at filling in the ecological gaps where other organisms have disappeared. That can mean colonizing areas where other insects have slowly died away, or blossoming in the aftermath of a big disaster, like a flood, or expanding their turf after a smaller upset, like a lot of typical human landscaping. Humans are a fire ants best friend, says Walter Tschinkel, a biology professor at Florida State University and author of The Fire Ants. In the south, if you have a lawn, you have created a lovely habitat for fire ants.
Fans of warm temperatures, the ants build their homes around sprinklers and irrigation channels that allow them to set up outposts in dry climates. With human-driven climate change not only heating up the world but exacerbating hurricanes and wildfires, fire ants are primed to reap their rewards. They are steadily expanding their territory northward and, in the US, westward.
Fire ants are a symptom of a global problem, says Craig Allen, leader of the US Geological Survey in Nebraska. He refers to it as biotic homogenization. Its a term for what happens when an invasive species outperforms locals and takes over their resources. In the long run, the outcome is less genetic diversity, and fewer evolutionary strategies for species to succeed. Which leads, over time, to weaker ecosystems and more extinctions.
The red imported fire ant evolved on the floodplains of central South America, but people have hauled the ants all over the world on wooden shipping pallets. Once they arrived in the USin Alabama, sometime in the 1930s or early 40sthey developed another superpower. Prior to their spread in the US, they were known to organize in colonies with a single queen. If another mound arose in their vicinity, they attacked these rival ants. As a result, colonies were spaced relatively far apart, with about 40 mounds per acre. But sometime around 1973, something shifted.
A group of USDA scientists came across an area near Gulfport, Mississippi with an unusual number of fire ant mounds in close vicinity, with many more fertile queens than the usual single mama ant. Over time, scientists began to realized the significance of these findings, that the red imported fire ant was fundamentally different from other ants. Though some ant species have multiple queens per colony and others have just one, no other species uses both reproductive strategies. Fire ant colonies with multiple queens are denser400 to 500 mounds an acre, instead of 40and take more of a toll on the species around them. Theyre also much harder to kill with an insecticide, since the poison has to lop off the heads of several queens instead of just one.
Fire ants are perhaps most notorious for forming floating balls of horror that can coast through hurricanes. After Hurricane Harvey, the ants formed rafts of workers that link together using hooks on their limbs. If flood victims accidentally run into these mobile colonies, the ants attack, turning a dangerous situation into a potentially deadly one. One person wrote on Twitter that he Had a golf ball size group wash up on my foot during flooding near Austin.
An estimated 14 million people are stung every year, with some of those incidents leading to hospitalizations. About half of people are at least somewhat allergic to fire ant stings, and roughly one percent of people are at risk of having a dangerous full-body reaction. The cost of a world where Solenopsis invicta thrives doesnt end with the medical bills. They cause at least $6.7 billion in annual damages to not only people but houses, electrical and telephone lines, and agriculture.
That figure only captures the costs we can easily estimate. The ants are also adept at taking down baby birds and reptiles, including quail, alligators, lizards, and turtlesin particular, the threatened gopher tortoise, which digs burrows that more than 360 other species use for shelter. Once one of these baby animals pokes a hole in its shell to begin hatching, the ants can swarm inside their shells.
As this ant continues its plunder, the outlook for these other species (and our own ability to walk fearlessly across a lawn) is bleak. But some species seem to be defying the odds and evolving fire-ant resistance. The fence lizard, common in the Eastern US, is known to freeze in response to a threat. Thats terrible if your enemy is the fire ant, which can swarm, bite, and ultimately kill such a target. In areas where fire ants thrive, however, fence lizards appeared to have learned to bolt instead, according to a recent study in the journal Global Change Biology.
Yet fire ants continue to conquer new territory, confounding scientists estimates of their likely spread time and again. If you look back over time, it's a lesson in humility, says Allen. With warming temperatures, nothings stopping the red imported fire ant any time soon.

Emily Price,"If you haven’t powered on your Sonos speakers in a while, now might be a good time to fire up the app. Researchers at Trend Micro have discovered a potential hack that allows people to access Songs Play:1, Songs One, and Bose SoundTouch systems. The speakers can be taken over via an online scan, allowing hackers to play music through your speakers even though you haven’t granted them specific access to your Wi-Fi network. Admittedly, as hacks go, getting your living room RickRolled (because yes, someone has already used this hack for that) isn’t the worst possible thing that could happen, but it’s still something you’d probably like to avoid. Technically hackers could also use it to play commands for an Alexa or Google Home device, which depending on what you have connected to those devices could make the situation much worse. Wired notes that some people have also experienced hackers playing sounds like crying babies or broken glass in the middle of the night through the speakers to startle their owners — not exactly what you want to wake up to, especially if you live alone. A Sonos rep told Wired : “looking into this more, but what you are referencing is a misconfiguration of a user’s network that impacts a very small number of customers that may have exposed their device to a public network. We do not recommend this type of set-up for our customers.” The good news is the hack only affects a small number of users. The researchers claim roughly 2,000 to 5,000 Sonos speakers are affected and only 500 Bose units, and there’s already a patch available for Sonos users you’ve just got to fire up the app to get it (if you haven’t already).","If you haven’t powered on your Sonos speakers in a while, now might be a good time to fire up the app. Read more...",2017-12-30T20:37:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Hackers Might Be Able to Access Your Sonos Speakers,https://lifehacker.com/hackers-might-be-able-to-access-your-sonos-speakers-1821670790,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3xQq2WJi--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/rg0xbchhs81ozjkikhyg.png",,Lifehacker.com,fire,1

Laura Mallonee,"Christie Hemm Klok’s 3-year-old son couldn't get enough of firefighters. He had a toy engine truck, a plastic helmet he wore all the time, and a collection of books showing firefighters dousing fires and saving lives. But most of them were men, and the lack of women bugged Hemm Klok. ""There was maybe one female in any of the books,"" she says, ""and she had short hair and maybe a pink shirt on."" Hemm Klok wanted to show her son a more inclusive vision of the world. She began visiting firehouses in San Francisco, where she lives, to photograph female firefighters. Her new book The Women of SFFD features 45 portraits of women who spend their days running into burning buildings. “I want to raise a son who thinks he can be whatever he wants—and so can everybody else,"" she says. More than 270 women serve in the San Francisco Fire Department, which services 1.5 million people across the city's 49 square miles. They make up roughly 16 percent of the force, compared to just half of one percent of the New York City Fire Department. The numbers don’t necessarily speak to the city’s open-mindedness, though. Oh sure, the fire department made a couple women honorary members in the 19th century (including a pretty opera singer who never picked up a hose). But it didn't allow women to apply for a job before 1976—and it didn't hire any until 1987, when a federal judge forced it to. Current chief Joanne Hayes-White became the first female to fill the role in 2004. “Now it’s not crazy for a woman to be a firefighter in San Francisco,” Hemm Klok says. “They’re on, like, every truck.” Hemm Klok started noticing the women on fire trucks after moving to San Francisco in 2015 to work at WIRED. She left the company in 2016, and began the series later that year, showing up at firehouses with her Canon 5D Mark IV and a portable light kit and inviting the women to pose for a portrait. More often than not, they'd get called away to fight a fire before she could snap their photo. “I can’t tell you how many times I was just sitting alone in the garage of a firehouse,” she says. Eventually, she began showing up early in the morning, after the women had finished their 24-hour shifts. And when she didn't have childcare, she brought her son. ""The firefighters spoiled him like crazy,"" she says. ""They even sent a firetruck to our house during his fourth birthday."" Photographing them challenged some of Hemm Klok's own misconceptions about the type of person who becomes a firefighter. Many of the women had worked in food service or education and only wandered into firefighting after hearing about it from a friend or attending a job fair. “When I thought about people becoming firefighters, I assumed it was something they always wanted to do, to save lives, be brave,” Hemm Klok says. “But a lot of times people come into it later in life."" Her portraits depict the women posing in the firehouses' offices, garages and locker rooms, still wearing their black turnout coats and helmets after a hard day on the job. They're refreshing.“We hear that representation matters all the time, and it really does,” Hemm Klok says. “It’s so reassuring to see yourself not left out of things.”",Christie Hemm Klok photographed 45 women who work for the San Francisco Fire Department.,2018-06-04T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Trailblazing Women Who Fight California’s Fires,https://www.wired.com/story/portraits-san-francisco-female-firefighters/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5b1177a205b78144fa73f4e1/191:100/pass/(from%20left)%20Cecilia%20Jiang%20(CJ)%20-%20Lieutenant,%2020%20years,%20Laura%20Wardell%20-%20Firefighter,%202%20years,%20Kacy%20Cardinale%20-%20Chief's%20Operator,%2027%20years,%20Mindy%20Talmadge%20-%20Administrative%20Officer,%2022%20years,%20Erin%20Yamamura%20-%20Firefighter,%2022%20years.jpg",wired,Wired,fire,1

Matt Simon,"Actions have consequences, as our parents likely told us as kids. But inaction has consequences, too. Life or death consequences, in the case of Californias new normal of massive, climate-change-driven wildfires.
After a series of devastating fires over the last few years, critics have turned their ire toward PG&amp;E, a utility that brings electricity to 5.4 million households and businesses in Northern California. Its equipment has been blamed for 17 of 21 major fires in 2017 alone. Facing the prospect that itll be officially implicated in last Novembers Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86, the utility has announced that its seeking bankruptcy protection.
What happens to PG&amp;E nextwhether it sells off bits of the business to survive, or the state forces the company to split up, or its turned into a public utilityisnt clear. But safety will haunt the utility no matter what. They have a failed track record, says California State Senator Jerry Hill. They have no safety culture today.
Preventing electrical equipment from sparking fires is not some arcane art. But it does have its complications, and forcing a utility to get its act together might require forceful regulation of the kind typically reserved for a railroad baron.
The biggest threat to the electric grid is wind. In California this becomes particularly problematic in the fall, when seasonal winds tear in from the east. These winds are hot and dry, and desiccate the vegetation, making ignition all but certain.
High wind not only makes the fire spread very fast, but it also knocks all those power lines and knocks all the equipment, which can generate explosions of sparks, whether that's arcing between lines or transformers exploding, says Michael Gollner, a fire protection engineer at the University of Maryland. It's almost always due to either collapse of power utility poles or contact between different lines.
Those complications arent necessarily a problem if the equipment is surrounded by pavement. But miles upon miles of power lines are strung through the wildlands of California, where they are surrounded by unkempt brush.
Even before these seasonal winds arrive, the lines are a major liability. We hit these really, really dry periods throughout the west in the summertime, says fire ecologist Robert Gray. That means a whole lot of air conditioners running. There's more juice running through the line and it sags closer to lower vegetation.
One fix is to bury the lines, but that doesnt work in much of California, where a lot of rock sits at the surface. You could do it, but it would be enormously expensive. Even if lines were buried where theres dirt, digging them up to do repairs is still pricey.
Then why dont utilities just cut power to lines when they know strong winds are coming? They do, actually, but that call is far from simple. You also cut off certain communities from vital services, says Gollner. You can turn off medical equipmentthere's all sorts of things to consider when you make those decisions. They have to weigh both liabilities, which is bizarre.
The best thing to do now, experts say, is to take a page from the era of railroad barons and rein in the utilities. From the 19th century well into the 1920s, America had a serious problem with railway fires. Burning coal or wood threw sparks out of the engine, which easily ignited vegetation around the tracks. It was like dragging a flare across the countryside.
Then regulators said: Yeah, thats going to have to stop. They made the railroads adopt spark arrestors. They required inspections for brakes, says wildfire historian Stephen Pyne. There were laws passed.
Regulators dragged the railroads into court if they didnt comply. A century ago, this was a huge industry, big money, big political clout, says Pyne. That's not unlike the power line situation.
First and foremost: lines simply have to be kept away from brush. That means a whole lot of money spent in fuel management, which California has been historically terrible at. In California, utilities are legally liable for any fire their equipment starts, even if they arent deemed to be negligent, so they better be damn sure that that equipment is clear of brush. That costs money, but its a tiny investment compared to paying for the ravages of wildfiresPG&amp;E says its facing a liability of $30 billion from just two years worth of conflagrations. Hence bankruptcy.
(PG&amp;E declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a press release that says it will make investments in system safety as it works with regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to consider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for the long-term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.)
Utilities know full well how to manage their risk. Both Pyne and Hill point to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which regulators found liable for the Witch Fire of 2007, as a model of current safety practices. For instance, it created a weather center that monitors for fire conditions. They created a new industry standard that has been ignored by PG&amp;E almost in every regard,"" says Hill. ""Ignoring those basic practices I believe resulted in the fires of 2017 and 2018.
In the long term, though, the solution may be for communities to become more independent about their power. Its not hard to foresee a future (however far off) in which electricity is much more decentralized: Instead of power coming from massive plants dotted throughout California, neighborhoods could establish their own hubs, using solar or wind power to charge large batteries throughout town. Outfitting your home with solar panels still aint exactly cheap, sure, but that price will continue to drop as the technology evolves. And decentralization in California very much depends on PG&amp;Es fate: If the state ends up breaking the utility into smaller entities, that might make things easier.
It's burying lines where we can, where it's feasible and appropriate,"" says Gray. ""It's decentralizing the hub so if you do have a power outage it doesn't impact huge areas. But it's also a system that uses a multitude of different sources of energy.
This is scary new era of climate-change-driven wildfires. But by reining in the utilities, just as we reined in the once-almighty railroads, perhaps we can help avoid catastrophes like Paradise.

ASTEAD W. HERNDON,"Mr. Obama did not publicly respond to Mr. Holders comments, but repeatedly in his speeches this summer, the former president has made an impassioned plea for his brand of politics: hopeful, civil and driven by incremental progress. Theres something at stake in this election that goes beyond politics, Mr. Obama said in Milwaukee last week. What is at stake is a politics that is decent. And honest. And lawful. That tries to do right by people and thats worthy of this country we love. Mr. Obama, who avoided the political arena for more than a year before returning this summer, has focused his efforts on states where Democrats are facing key races in the Senate. He also tends to hold rallies in urban areas with voters who are historically less likely to vote in midterm elections, including young people and minorities. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who now runs a liberal media company, said the former presidents message has evolved on key issues such as voter suppression and structural racism. The Republican Party has become more overtly tied to white identity politics and immigration reduction, Mr. Favreau said, and Mr. Obama has become more explicit in his indictments. In doing so, he has laid out a pathway for how Democratic candidates can criticize while not resorting to mudslinging. Mr. Favreau said campaigns like Mr. Gillums in Florida, Ms. Abramss in Georgia and Mr. ORourkes in Texas were the next generation and the next iteration of that Obama message of hope. If you are only fighting Donald Trump, and if youre only fighting Republicans with whatever sick burn you can figure out, you havent done the full job, he said.

Tom McKay,"Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003. Per CNN, Cal Fire says the blaze has now burned through some 1,063 buildings and is just 65 percent contained weeks after starting on December 4th. It also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th. The fire began in Ventura County and spread to neighboring Santa Barbara County, fueled by flame-optimal winds and plenty of dry brush to burn. As the L.A. Times reported, the official list of wildfires only dates back to 1932 because prior records are less reliable. One contender for the all-time spot remains the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire, which reputedly scorched some 300,000 acres (and some research supports those accounts ). Large stretches of southern California now lie in ruins. In some cases, the fire spread so fast that terrified residents were forced to evacuate without their possessions in the dead of night as smoke surrounded their homes. “I feel like I’m spinning,” local resident Jeff Jacobson, whose house was mostly burned, told the L.A. Times. “I’m overwhelmed and stressed, which is hard because I need to be clear-minded.” According to officials, this is the worst season for wildfires in memory. Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north. The frequency of massive fires in the state has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to both accidental blazes started by humans and trends linked to climate change like extreme droughts. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the Times. “What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Fire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion. “The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.” [ CNN ]","Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.

Michael Hardy,"After years of playing with fire, Kevin Cooley finally got burned. Inspired by the smoke signals used at the Vatican to signal the election of a new pope, the multimedia artist began setting controlled fires in and around his studio and photographing their multicolored plumes of smoke. In a way, it was the logical next step for an artist whose previous projects have examined earth, water, and wind, the other three classical elements.
But in 2017, Cooleys personal and professional lives unexpectedly intersected when the La Tuna fire nearly destroyed his Los Angeles home, which sits on a two-acre lot in the Tujunga neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, between the Verdugo and San Gabriel Mountains. The fire broke out on September 1, and quickly began racing through the hills of the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank.
Cooley happened to be helping his son assemble an emergency preparedness kit for a school assignment when he first noticed smoke rising from behind a nearby hill. ""It was hard to tell how far away it was, because there was just this giant smoke column,"" he recalls. He and his family had just moved into the house after a six-month renovation; now they had to pack their most valuable belongings in a car in case they needed to evacuate. (At the top of Cooley's list: hard drives containing his digital photographs, and some old negatives.)
The night passed uneventfully, Cooley and his wife sleeping in shifts, but in the morning the fire crested a nearby hill, with only an empty expanse of dry chaparral between it and them. After helping his family evacuate, Cooley returned with his camera to document the possible immolation of his home. ""The only way I could process the fire was to photograph it,"" he says. ""I took a lot of the photographs from my driveway, essentially.""
The hard work of local firefighters saved the house, and Cooley continued photographing the aftermath of the fire, which eventually consumed over 7,000 acres, becoming one of the largest in Los Angeles history. Over the following weeks, Cooley was amazed to see the charred landscape showing early signs of recovery. ""The chaparral ecosystem only regenerates through fire,"" he says. ""It was amazing how fast it came back.""
After the close call with destruction, Cooley briefly considered leaving LA. ""But where do you go that's safe from natural disasters?"" he says. ""New York has flooding from hurricanes, the Midwest has tornadoes, anywhere in California has earthquakes. I really don't know where safe is."" Besides, he points out, unloading his house might prove a challenge for the immediate future.
""There's a charred landscape right behind methat's not exactly a great selling point.""

SARAH MERVOSH,"A sixth person has died in the Carr Fire in Northern California, the authorities said on Sunday, as officials hinted they could be nearing a turning point in fighting the vast and erratic wildfire that has been burning for nearly a week. Tom Bosenko, the Shasta County sheriff, said at a news conference on Sunday that the latest victim was found after the fire consumed their home. He did not identify the person or say where in the region the person was found. Seven people were still reported missing, he said. The fire has claimed six lives since it began on July 23. Melody Bledsoe of Redding, Calif., and her great-grandchildren, James Roberts, 5, and Emily Roberts, 4, died after the fire engulfed Ms. Bledsoe’s home, a family representative said. Officials have also identified two other victims, Jeremy Stoke, a firefighter, and Don Ray Smith, a bulldozer operator. The fire, which officials have called extremely dangerous with “no regard for what’s in its path,” had scorched more than 80,000 acres on Saturday, up from more than 40,000 on Friday.","A fire truck on Highway 299 as the Carr Fire burned near Whiskeytown, Calif., on Saturday.

Matt Simon,"The month-long launch window for NASA’s new Mars lander, InSight opens this weekend. InSight will be the first spacecraft to use a robotic arm to place its instruments on another planet’s soil—effectively unraveling the innards of the Red Planet. It’s also the first interplanetary mission to launch from the West Coast instead of Cape Canaveral, and it may not be the last. InSight isn’t a rover, like Curiosity or Opportunity, but a stationary lander. Its mission is to peer deep into Mars with two main instruments. One is a probe that’ll hammer 16 feet deep to take the planet’s temperature and determine how much heat it’s losing. (That heat comes from the violent formation of a planet, but also the decay of radioactive elements.) The other is a seismometer for sensing marsquakes. Together, the instruments, which the robot arm will pluck from the deck of the spacecraft, will ideally show what Mars is made of, lending insight (sorry) into not just how the Red Planet came to be, but the history of other rocky planets in our solar system. First, though, InSight has to get off Earth. Engineers stuck it atop an Atlas V-401 rocket, which stands nearly 200 feet tall and weighs in at 730,000 pounds, including the spacecraft. (By contrast, the world’s largest rocket, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, tallies a cool 3.1 million pounds. NBD.) It’ll launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Los Angeles. Why snub Cape Canaveral in Florida, which is traditionally the launch site for interplanetary missions? Because the West Coast is no slouch, is why. For one, things are busy on the East Coast, thanks in part to satellite-happy commercial outfits like SpaceX. (Cape Canaveral is scrambling to accommodate all those launches, aiming to average a launch a week in the next five years.) Putting a satellite in orbit around our planet is one thing, but Mars spacecraft are extra complicated because they have to launch when the positions of Earth and the Red Planet are just right. “If it's a planetary mission, you end up with a very short window you have to launch in,” says Scott Messer, program manager for NASA launch services at United Launch Alliance, which operates the rocket. If a primo day opens up, InSight can’t have other peoples’ rockets clogging up the spaceport. You have to go, and go now. The next consideration, of course, is geography. Cape Canaveral is great for launches because NASA can fire east over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over land. “Because of that, you're able to take advantage of the rotation of the Earth a little bit more,” says Messer. Planetary physics gives the vehicle a nice little boost on its way into space. Also, you don’t want a malfunctioning rocket falling on a city. To get that same slingshot effect from Vandenberg on the West Coast, you’d need to fire over the continental US, which … not safe and not allowed. So instead InSight will head south over the waters off Mexico. (Here’s a great video showing the trajectory.) It’ll only head kinda east. But fear not: It will still most certainly have the power to escape Earth’s gravitational clutches. InSight is a relatively light spacecraft that was small enough to fit on a Delta II rocket, which carried the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. But when ULA procured the mission in 2013, the Delta II was no longer flying from the East Coast. “Because we didn't have that Delta II capability any longer from the East Coast, we went to our next size vehicle,” says Messer. That’d be the Atlas V-401, which comes with extra power. Thus InSight could launch from the West Coast. Really, though, it was the crowdedness of Cape Canaveral that moved the mission to California. Right now, Vandenberg launches mostly satellites, at a much less frantic pace than the Cape. (After InSight, Vandenberg is scheduled to send off six more rockets carrying satellites before the end of September. And by the way, regardless of when it launches in its month-long window, InSight will land on Mars on November 26.) But InSight is setting precedent here. “There may be additional opportunities going forward to have larger vehicles launch interplanetaries from the West Coast,” says Messer. Given the pace of the commercial space race, we’ll be seeing more and more launches around the world. Russia, for instance, has begun launching from a shiny new cosmodrome. In the US, the fact remains that Florida has the right geography both for old folks looking for nice weather and for rocket scientists looking to fire east, and it’s going to stay that way. That is, until rising seas eat Florida. But hey, maybe by that time we’ll all be living on Mars with InSight. More on InSight You have no idea what lengths NASA goes through to keep a spacecraft like InSight clean. Want more info on the science behind InSight? Here’s our guide. Just because InSight is headed to Mars, doesn’t mean we can forget about Curiosity, which is autonomously sampling rocks with a laser now.","This month, NASA will fire its first interplanetary mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base north of Los Angeles.

ADDINGTON STEWART,"Despite a rich history of black firefighting heroes that goes back to the beginnings of a professionalized service in the early 19th century, firefighting in this country is stained by a tradition of exclusion. Post-segregation, discrimination was reinforced through deep-rooted nepotism and cronyism. For those whose great-grandfather, grandfather and father weren’t firefighters — and especially for applicants with the wrong color, gender or sexuality — training and testing became an impermeable barrier. Notoriously, white male recruits received special mentoring and reduced scrutiny by those in charge of hiring. So-called bad apples can’t be blamed for all the racial problems in fire departments today. The problems are system-deep. To begin to solve them, local fire department leaders must step up their efforts to support and enforce inclusivity. We should prioritize hiring fire chiefs who are fully committed to dismantling nepotism and tackling those professional traditions that degrade opportunity. We need an impartial, standardized and professional process for testing at entry level and on promotional exams to inoculate against the effects of bias and favoritism. Fire departments must enforce workplace rules already in place. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 8 percent of our nation’s firefighters are African-Americans, and an even smaller percentage hold leadership positions. In that way, our nation’s fire service is like many other industries that are still battling hate and bias, both subtle and in-your-face. What makes firefighting unusual is that as we’re rolling out of the firehouse with sirens on — whether responding to a fire, drug overdose or car crash — we know that what we encounter may be the worst moment in someone’s life. Our hearts are pounding, and we’re aware that any call could be a one-way trip for us. Smoke inhalation, building collapse and backdraft are known risks and we accept them.","An electrician for the New York Fire Department, Gregory Seabrook, second from left, with his lawyers at a news conference in 2011.

Sarah Scoles,"I first heard about Colorado’s Spring Fire on July 1, when I was driving back from a camping trip. My mom texted me from her home in Florida: “How close are these fires?” I pulled over to a rest stop, called up the federal disaster website Inciweb, and sent her back a screenshot of the wildfire’s perimeter. It seemed far away from my house on the Huerfano County line, like it would have to cross impossible acres to even come close. “Looks like we’re good,” I wrote back. The Spring Fire is the third largest in the state’s history. By the time I learned about it, the fire had already burned through more than 40,000 acres. A plume of smoke unfurled into a constantly replenished mushroom cloud. It was 0 percent “contained,” meaning that no human-made or natural barrier was stopping the fire’s edge from expanding. Costilla and Huerfano counties had evacuated around 2,000 households by July 2. The fire had, by then, grown to more than 56,000 acres, just 5 percent contained. I arrived at my cabin on the 3rd, hose in hand, knowing I couldn’t really help the house but not knowing what else to do. The Spring Fire had bloomed to nearly 80,000 acres. The Department of Transportation closed the highway right at the turnoff to my place. Big-bellied planes full of retardant crossed the sky overhead, their flight path traversing part of the bullishly-named Wet Valley. That night, the sunset, reflecting off the smoke particles, was spectacular. The mountains all looked like they were on fire—even the ones that weren’t. Forty miles south, from their base in the Huerfano county seat of Walsenburg, a group called Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team had taken charge of taming and containing the northern section of the blaze; another team, Rocky Mountain Area Incident Management Team Black, was assigned to deal with the southern portion. To direct the emergency response personnel—nearly 1,800 people worked the fire at its peak—the group needed a lot of data, a tightly wound plan, and a weirdly Office Space organizational structure. Fire behavior analyst Shelly Crook, Blue Team, is key to that endeavor. She’s in charge of figuring out what the northern portion of the fire is doing and what it will do. Every morning during the Spring Fire, she has woken up in the bed she keeps in the back of her car. By 5 am, she shows up at the ad hoc incident command post—at John Mall High School—to see if an infrared plane went out overnight. “I take stock of that data, and see where the fire moved from the previous perimeter, to see how much it has grown,” she says. This is Crook’s fourth fire this year, and when we spoke, it was her 60th day in the field (she is “retired”). “When a fire starts, you kind of drop everything,” she says. And so did the other Western-based members of her team, who converged quickly on the Spring Fire after the call went out from the Geographic Area Coordination Center, which helps mobilize emergency resources. At their temporary command post in Walsenburg, they have all the divisions a business might, including finance types, HR reps, and PortaPotty procurers. Every day, a planning team writes out a 30-page packet of information about everything a firefighter might need, from which frequencies to use for communications to what the weather will be like. For that latter part, there’s a dedicated meteorologist. He sits next to Crook as part of a unit that prints more than 150 maps every day—county roads and structures, topography from the US Geological Survey, GPS locations from the ground. After Crook checks on the infrared flight, she gets information from her officemate about the relative humidity recovery—she’s hoping that it increased significantly overnight. “If it’s good, the fire is not going to be active as early,” she says. They dig into data from weather stations—permanent ones and seven RAWS, remote automated weather systems, specially installed at critical Spring Fire locations—informing a forecast Crook will present during morning meetings. That’s just the beginning of Crook’s day, which she dedicates to predicting—as best she can—the north fire’s next moves. That kind of information eventually makes its way to the community—via in-person meetings and daily one-sheets. The public document released on the Fourth of July waffled in its optimism. “Overnight, calmer winds and lighter fuels slowed fire growth along the south and east flanks of the North Spring Fire,” it said. “Fire activity increased along the northwest flank near Sheep Mountain as it moved into dry, mixed timber.” By the afternoon, data from an infrared flight revealed the fire’s total extent to be 95,739 acres. The preevacuation zone, shown on a Google map, now stretched to two miles from my house. To the south, the view from the porch had morphed into a wall of smoke. I did the things on a preevacuation checklist, just in case: take down curtains, close and unlock windows, turn off the gas, turn on the lights, bring everything in off the porch. I used the hose to fill buckets with water and place them around the house. I didn’t need to (pre-pre-evacuation is just non-evacuation), but my nerves had history: When I was 12, a Florida wildfire destroyed 30 structures in my rural area, and my family didn’t get out in time: On our path down the highway, the road was blocked by fire, and we spent hours in a landfill entryway, surrounded by flames. There are concrete steps individual citizens can take to become more firewise in general: get the gunk out of gutters, clear defensible no-brush space around your house, keep wood piles and propane a few dozen feet away, screen all openings so embers don’t sneak in. But sometimes, despite best efforts, Mother Nature wields an upper hand. By this point in the fire, on the Fourth, more than 100 homes had been lost. At six p.m., I tuned in to the community briefing, streamed via Facebook Live from the small town of La Veta. “Happy Fourth of July, everybody,” said David Detray, fire chief of the La Veta area. “I want to give you this picture of your La Veta Fire Protection District personnel.” On the screen behind him, eight firefighters, two holding American flags and one holding a giant teddy bear, stood in a V, seemingly paused in a march through an otherwise empty street. This picture was from the main street in Cuchara, an 8,500-foot-high village that had been evacuated. Citizens couldn’t hold their annual Independence Day parade, which they’ve done for some 50 years. So the firefighters took a moment to stage a miniature, kind of morbid one for them. “These are your people,” Detray said. In the Blue Team’s update, operations section chief Chris Zoller noted where the fire had been “pushing,” expanding its edge by 6,000 to 7,000 acres. He moved on to an area, full of trees, where the fire would soon hit a road and move into a region called “Paradise Acres.” “This is going to be our trouble area for the next 24 hours,” he says. After presenting her initial forecast at Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team morning meetings, Crook goes right back into prediction mode. She feeds information into models that forecast the fire’s behavior, part of the Wildland Fire Decision Support System —a powerful tool that gobbles up data from multiple sources to support wildfire strategy-making. Some of the information it sucks in comes from a federal program called Landfire, which can help firefighters tell what is growing on the affected ground, how it burns, and how topography flows beneath it. Although the support system itself is much newer, these federal prediction models have been in development for around 30 years. “They’ve morphed and become more robust,” says Crook. Crook has two favorites: the three-day perimeter projection, and the fire spread probability prediction. “It tells me over the course of the next seven to 14 days what is the probability of the fire impacting any point on the landscape,” she says. But simulations can only simulate. So in the afternoon, Crook heads out with the firefighters and comes back with ground truth. She can feed specific information back into the models—essentially calibrating them to the North Spring Fire. Still, it’s not a perfect system. “There’s a bit of a mystery on every fire,” she says. There’s also a bit of logistical challenge: Not just where to put the PortaPotties but also how to get the humans and heavy equipment you need. When the Spring Fire started and Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team showed up on the scene, the fire was already moving fast. They needed to act. But the rest of the state also seemed to be on fire. “It took like four days before I was able to get the resources to even come close to what we needed to help start suppressing the fire,” says Jay Esperance, the Blue Team’s incident commander. But that, he says, is life. “There’s only so many firefighters and equipment, and we were the new show in town.” Once the heavy machinery did arrive, it was substantial: At one point, there were 17 bulldozers to clear out lines of land to contain the blaze; two “masticators” to chew up brush and other small-diameter stuff; and skidders to move logs. In addition to ground-bound resources, the Spring Fire fighters also took to the sky. They used planes and helicopters, although Zoller calls them “fixed-wing” and “rotor-wing” aircraft. The planes that combated this blaze—stashed in fire-prone regions across the country during the volatile season—included single-engine flyers and VLATs : Very Large Air Tankers. Both carried fire retardant that spilled from their bellies like paintball powder. The helicopters took care of the H 2 O. “Water is for the immediate need to cool things down,” says Zoller. Retardant, meanwhile, slows the fire down. Above the winged craft flies an “eye in the sky”: an in-the-air air-traffic controller. “He directs all the traffic, and keeps the rotor-wing out of the way of the fixed-wing,” says Zoller. Because the last thing anyone needs during a wildfire is a plane crash. At a July 11 evacuee meeting in Fort Garland, which once hosted a functional military fort, a southern-section public information officer took the stage. “We’re going to start off with some good news,” she said. The entire fire was 83 percent contained, and the southern perimeter was entirely under control. Team Black was going home. Crook’s Blue Team took over the whole operation, which, two days later, was 91 percent contained. The northern edge of the fire stayed far enough from my house that I never had to evacuate, and the Blue Team soon packed up, leaving operations to local teams on July 16. On their way out of town, they decontaminated their equipment, to avoid transporting invasive species, “weed-washing” the outside with high-pressure hoses and burning the insides of tanks with 140-degree water. The path to recovery will be long and hard, like the roads that climb up through the high mountain passes here. According to the Denver Post, the area has brought in the disaster cleanup nonprofit Team Rubicon to help, and a group called the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster will assist, too. More than 225 structures were destroyed, according to a July 18 report from the National Interagency Coordination Center. What was forest is charred trunks, scorched earth. And no matter how much data anyone or any satellites take, it’s impossible to predict exactly what will happen next for the communities. But if one of Crook’s models could provide imperfect post-fire forecasts, it would probably say that life will slowly grow back toward normal.

Laura Mallonee,"The Japanese call fireworks hanabi, meaning ""fire flower."" The name suggests not only a physical resemblance, but also an existential one. Fireworks bloom, but only for a moment, dazzling onlookers before fading into oblivion. Their transience inspires Makoto Igari to document hanabi every summer, when explosions light up the night skies across Japan. ""I want to keep them as photographs,"" he says. Local governments throw some 7,000 fire flower festivals—called Hanabi Taikai —each year, mostly in late July and August. Hundreds of thousands of people attend, wearing traditional summer kimonos called yukatas and sandals made of wood or bamboo. The crowds oooh and aaah, shouting the names of historic pyrotechnic guilds like Kagiya and Tamaya to express their appreciation. The tradition dates back to the Edo period, well before Americans began commemorating independence by blowing stuff up. In 1733, the ruling shogun placated his people by supplying gunpowder for a show above the Sumida River in modern Tokyo. Within a century, legendary fireworks factories like Kagiya and Tamaya began competing for the crowds' affections, a spirit of rivalry that lives on at events like the All Japan Fireworks Competition, where famed pyrotechnicians like Keiji Hosoya and Yoichi Nomura face off. With such a history, it's no wonder Japan produces some of the most exquisite fireworks in the world. Traditional warimono fireworks explode as perfect spheres, due to their careful construction. Craftsmen pack round shells with explosive shots called ""stars,"" arranging them in concentric circles around a bursting charge. Some 2,000 feet in the air, the stars scatter in all directions, lighting up in unison and molting colors as they expand into elaborate, tripped-out chrysanthemums, peonies, and weeping willows. They're symbols of impermanence—a pervasive theme in Japanese art, according to Japan scholars Damien Liu-Brennan and Mio Bryce. ""This accords with essential Japanese aesthetic principles, encompassing a reverence towards nature, the melancholic appreciation of ephemeral beauty, and the need for an embracement of life in its entirety,"" they wrote in a 2010 paper published in The International Journal of the Arts in Society. Igari, an ardent fireworks follower based in Ibaraki Prefecture, attends up to 10 fireworks shows each summer, driven by his quest to preserve the pyrotechnical displays. He fits his Pentax K-1 with a neutral density filter to prevent overexposure and shoots from a half-mile away, triggering 5-second exposures with a remote release. The trick, he says, is to capture the fireworks straight on, so that the sparks fill the center of the frame. His photographs are a striking tribute to hanabi, capturing exploding bouquets of pyrotechnic blossoms before they wither away.

Chaim Gartenberg,"George R.R. Martin has announced that he’ll be releasing a new book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series this fall — sort of. No, it’s not the long awaited The Winds of Winter, which promises to finally continue the saga that Martin begin back in 1996 and which fans have been waiting almost seven years to read. Rather, fans will be able to enjoy 640 pages of Fire and Blood, a collection of short stories that tell “the definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros.” Fire and Blood is said to be the first of two planned volumes of these historical stories, which Martin has alluded to before in the main series of the books, as well as in his companion history, The World of Ice and Fire. But Fire and Blood, along with its unnamed sequel, promise a more in-depth look at the tale. According to Martin, volume one “covers all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane),” while the rest will be coming in volume two somewhere down the line. (Martin promises that he’ll get to it in a “few years,” but take that with a grain of salt.) As a reminder: it’s been almost seven years since the last real A Song of Ice and Fire book was published Martin has actually published portions of the upcoming book as standalone stories in various anthologies — The Princess and the Queen, The Rogue Prince, and The Sons of the Dragon, but Fire and Blood will mark the first time that those stories have been published in a single volume, along with plenty of new material that will continue to flesh out the history of the Targaryens, along with 80 black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Unlike the main A Song of Ice and Fire books, Fire and Blood is written as an in-universe history, purportedly written by the Archmaester Gyldayn of the Citadel, in a style that Martin’s publisher describes as channeling the “scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” assuming that was something that you were looking for in your epic fantasy novels. As someone who’s read some of the previously published novellas, I can tell you that Martin has somehow achieved the almost impossible task of making a civil war between people with dragons seem dull, with dry prose that would fit right alongside Gibbon’s famed work. Fortunately for everyone, though, not only has George R.R. Martin decided to expand this into a 640 page long book, but there’s going to be TWO of them. As for The Winds of Winter — which I will again remind you has been anticipated since A Dance with Dragons was published back in July 2011, a seven-year gap that has seen Martin publish a different collection of Game of Thrones novellas, a different fake Game of Thrones history book, and a fake atlas for Game of Thrones — you’ll have to keep waiting, with Martin only commenting that “No, winter is not coming… not in 2018, at least.” Fire and Blood will be out on November 20th.","George R.R.

As Mozilla and Amazon announced today, Firefox, which joins Amazon’s own Silk browser on the device, is now available for all your browsing needs. “Bringing Firefox to Fire TV is an exciting new way to reach our users and serve up more of the full web to everyone,” said Mark Mayo, Sr. Vice President of Firefox, in today’s announcement. “Firefox has always been about bringing the web directly to people no matter what device they’re using. Starting today, we will be able to expand the already great Fire TV experience by enabling viewers to surface a multitude of web content — including videos — through Firefox.” While Amazon’s own press release boasts about how its Silk browser has been optimized for use on the Fire TV and with the Fire TV remote, the company doesn’t quite give Mozilla’s browser the same kind of billing in today’s announcement. As far as we can tell, Mozilla has done quite a bit of work to integrate its browser with the Fire TV remote and app, though. Also, given that YouTube will likely disappear from Amazon devices at the beginning of January, thanks to a spat between Amazon and Google, it’s no surprise that Mozilla is billing its browser as an easy way to watch YouTube videos. Unsurprisingly, Amazon makes no mention of YouTube in its announcement today, but for Mozilla, this is surely a smart way of getting a few more users to install its browser.

Mejs Hasan,"Sometimes Vikki Preston is inching her way through the forest when she comes across a grove of tan oak trees that feels special. The plants are healthy, the trees are old, and their trunks are nicely spaced out on the forest floor. “You can feel that the grove has been taken care of,” she says. “There’s been a lot of love and thoughtfulness.” Tan oak groves have long been tended by indigenous people who still live along the banks of the forested Klamath and Salmon Rivers near the California-Oregon border. Preston, a cultural resource technician for the Karuk tribe, grew up watching her grandfather tend just such a grove— by burning it. Fire helped cleared away small pines, alders, and willows. It killed pests like weevils that ruin acorns, and allowed for new, straight shoots of hazel to grow that can be used for basket-weaving. It left a forest sentineled with sugar pine and oaks, scattered with meadows full of wildflowers and ferns. Such scenery is rare in the western US today, a result of 1911 federal legislation that outlawed igniting fire in public forest lands. That legislation curtailed centuries of forest management by the native Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa people, who had long lived in villages dotted throughout these public forests; a 1918 US Forest Service ranger’s memo declared that “renegade Indian” fires were rooted in “pure cussedness.” A hundred years later, though, western science and policy-makers are rethinking. Federal forests are now choked with dead leaves, brush, and dense fir trees, a tinderbox for wildfires whirling out of control. Wildfires burned just over 2,000 acres in the decade between 1975 and 1985, compared to over 350,000 acres between 2005 and 2015. So in a new policy, the Forest Service on July 27 signed an implementation plan for managing public forest lands—an agreement in which both fire and the Karuk play a vital role. The first project will burn 5,570 acres near Somes Bar, California, with the Karuk, NGOs, state and federal agencies all working to manage the project’s contracts and workforce for the next 10 years. To prepare the forest, Karuk and other local work crews will first saw away some brush and thick vegetation, lightening the load of flammable material, explains Bill Tripp from the Karuk Department of Natural Resources. They will also use heavy equipment to thin out some dense stands of conifer trees, opening up room for hardwoods that are being shaded out. A few landowners whose homesteads are tucked within the public forest are wary of the controlled burns. But Will Harling, co-director of the Mid-Klamath Watershed Council, says most of them have come to see their logic. It’s the difference between having a few days of smoky air and long months of wildfire smoke. And part of the work crews’ task is to dig up a bare-soil buffer to protect private lands. Usually if a prescribed burn gets out of control, it’s due to inexperience. But among the Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa, fire knowledge is deep—and now that laws are changing, that knowledge can finally be applied. Preston attends a yearly managed fire training program, TREX, in her small hometown of Orleans. The two-week program attracts about 80 to 100 participants, who learn to spray water, create fire buffers, and determine safe temperature and wind conditions for managed fires. At the end, the teams conduct a prescribed burn on a few hundred acres of forest. Trained youth teach their new skills to their parents, filling in generational gaps where traditions were lost (federal policies separated Karuk children from their families for “re-education” in the early 1900s). Getting to this point took a lot of work. In 2009, a previous collaboration between the Forest Service and the Karuk fell apart when a ceremonial trail was damaged by loggers. During discussions, the Karuk had pointed out the significance of this trail, but their requested protections never made it into the Forest Service logging contract. Resentment built and all sides found themselves in court, which eventually ordered the contract be re-written with cultural protection in place. Just around that time, Randy Moore became the regional forester for the Forest Service in the area. Moore grew up in Louisiana, and moved to North Dakota to work with natural resources. “I was shy and reserved,” Moore recalls, and stood out as an African-American man. “I didn’t think anyone wanted to know what I think. What made a difference to me was when people invited me into the conversation.” Moore remembered that feeling when he started working in the Klamath River area. To rebuild trust, he hired two Hupa members, Merv George and Nolan Colegrove, to his team. “They were both highly qualified,” Moore says, “and I really mean that.” In 2013, the Karuk and NGOs led the formation of the Western Klamath Restoration Partnership, with members including indigenous people, the Forest Service, landowners, and fire safety councils. The Nature Conservancy facilitated the hodge-podge of interests through public workshops, out of which emerged the first pilot project at Somes Bar. It was just awarded $5 million from Cal FIRE, besides other funding from the Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. On July 27, about 40 people assembled around a table placed at Camp Creek in the forest outside of Orleans to watch the Forest Service sign the project implementation plan. “We had elders crying their eyes out, they never thought they’d see this day,” says David Medford Rubalcaba, who heads the Karuk’s Integrated Fire and Fuels Management Program and is in charge of the Karuk work crews who will carry out the project. “There’s still some people around here who think natives are savages. But western science is catching up. They’re finally realizing that Native Americans have had this [forest management] knowledge all along.” One day, Rubalcaba hopes they will manage the entire 1.4 million acre area that comprises Karuk aboriginal lands, almost all of it administered by the Forest Service today. But in the near future, they at least want to clear away enough brush and forest litter so it will be safe enough to perform ceremonial burning for the Karuk’s World Renewal Ceremony at Offield Mountain. Ceremonial burning has been absent for over a century. American Indians across the US are now contacting Tripp, Rubalcaba, and others in the Klamath River, wondering what chances they have for similar partnerships. Many tribes in different parts of the country are in conflict with local authorities—from state agencies controlling reservation water resources in Wyoming, to oil and gas companies threatening to disrupt reservation lands in Oklahoma. Rubalcaba offers them advice and some hope: “Washington, DC is watching what’s happening here, they’re aware. If you can’t convince your local agencies to help, what about Congress or your governor? If you can’t build it with them, go higher up, go to Washington, go to the media. You’ll get somebody’s ear. Talk to other tribes, find out what ear they have. But don’t wait, don’t waste time.” More Great WIRED Stories","On July 27, the US Forest Service signed a new plan for managing public forest lands that lets tribes like the Karuk continue their tradition of controlled burns.",2018-08-09T18:57:37Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Native Tribes Are Taking Fire Control Into Their Own Hands,https://www.wired.com/story/wildfires-native-tribes-controlled-burns/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b6b6c404177c301e3b9b0ca/191:100/pass/klamath-567371569.jpg,wired,Wired,fire,1
Aarian Marshall,"In theory, creating a safer street should be easy : Make life harder for cars and easier for people. That means lowering the speed limit, building speed bumps, traffic circles, and bulb-outs, which narrow roads and force drivers to be more cautious, and creating special, separated spaces in the street for drivers, cyclists, and walkers. Firefighters, though—they just want to get where they're going, fast. And in cities like Baltimore or New York, fire departments have pushed back against design tweaks that better protect bicyclists and walkers, arguing that the changes make it harder to maneuver their fire engines, and thus, protect residents. In Baltimore, the conflict even led to litigation. In San Francisco, though: compromise. Earlier this month at Fire Department Station 13, tucked between the twisty, turn-y, packed streets of Chinatown and the Financial District, the San Francisco Fire Department rolled out its latest ride—a fire engine that plays nice with people-friendly streets. It’s a design of incremental adjustments that add up big improvements. The smaller, smarter Vision Zero truck will make it easier for firefighters to navigate roads clogged with bike lanes, double parkers, delivery trucks, and Uber drop-offs, the department says. It concludes (for now) a chippy multi-year battle between safe street advocates and the fire department. “The fire department and San Francisco Bicycle Collation and safe streets advocates have a common value,” says Brian Wiedenmeier, the executive director of the cycling advocacy group San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “We all care about safety. The solutions that we were seeking were putting us at odds with people we want to be working alongside.” This fire engine seems like a small-ish symbol that the city can build an infrastructure that’s safer for daily commuters and yet swift enough in emergencies. City Engines Teensy firefighting vehicles are nothing new. In Europe's medieval streets, smaller vehicles have long been used to fight fires—check out the two-headed 1952 Citroën 2CV used in the southeastern French town of Coglin, or Sweden’s current rapid response vehicles. In Singapore, first responders use the petite Red Rhino, an Isuzu D-Max pickup truck. But those vehicles wouldn't work in San Francisco. ""It's like wearing ski boots to a dance competition. You're not going to make it,"" says San Francisco Fire Department Assistant Deputy Chief Anthony Rivera. They're too puny: Each firefighting vehicle must carry 500 gallons of water—better to fight house fires in this wood-frame dominated city—and regularly ascend 22 percent grade hills. They need all the horsepower they can get. Thus, this small-er vehicle, from Ferrara Fire Apparatus. It’s ten inches shorter and two inches narrower than the department’s older trucks, and the turning radius has been knocked down to 25 feet from 33. That doesn't sound like much, but the downsizing gives it juuust enough room to navigate around double parked cars and unprotected bicycle lanes. The trucks can now also navigate bulb-outs, those pedestrian-friendly street design elements that jut into the street and give more lane space to walkers instead of vehicles. The department insisted the manufacturer make tiny adjustments to squeeze even more street safety out of the fire engine. Equipment compartments, once outfitted with doors that suing outward, now roll up, so they take up less room when open. Windows that once came with a darker automotive tint are now tint-free, allowing firefighting drivers to communicate with cyclists or walkers. The back of the vehicle has extra turn signals so those in the street can anticipate its next move. Four cameras placed around the Vision Zero give the driver a 360-degree view of the outside. “We want to be as flexible as possible and good neighbors,” says Rivera. A bird's-eye view from the new 360-degree camera setup inside the fire engine. The city has six of these engines in service in its most tortuous, packed downtown areas, and it will roll out at least two more soon. Another six to eight are probably on the way. But that doesn't mean that the détente between the fire department and safe street advocates is complete. “Traffic circles, speed humps—the fire department has not been approving those to the extent that we would like to see them, because they’re concerned about response time,” says Cathy DeLuca, who oversees policy for the pedestrian advocacy group Walk San Francisco. Other American cities are looking on. In Baltimore, where the local advocacy group BikeMore just wrapped up a lawsuit against the city government over its plans to pull up an under-construction bike lane, safe street advocates are trying to teach City Hall how to evaluate safety measures against one another. If emergency services can work within their funding and procurement schedules to build smaller, faster vehicles, that leaves more room for walkers or cyclists. And how many more would choose a brisk, healthy walk to work instead of taking their car if there were walking-friendly infrastructure, like wider sidewalks? Or bike to work if there were a protected bike lane? (Research suggests a bunch.) ""We have to approach this holistically and can’t sacrifice one safety for another,"" says Liz Cornish, who heads up Bikemore. Smaller fire engines are just a start.

MALIKA ANDREWS,"“We didn’t think it was going to be a one-year turnaround,” Hornacek said. He added: “You expect a rebuilding situation to go out there and win 50 games? That’s why they call it rebuilding. But when you mention rebuilding, you’re still trying to win games.” But Hornacek will no longer lead that turnaround. He had one year left on his three year, $15 million contract. “Jeff is a true professional who has worked tirelessly for this organization the last two seasons,’’ the Mills and Perry said in their statement. “We sincerely appreciate his efforts and considerable contributions to the team and wish him well in his future endeavors.” The Knicks did not give a timeline for hiring a new coach. Two names that have been thrown around as possible successors: Doc Rivers and Mark Jackson. Rivers — who played for the Knicks from 1992 to 1994 — is the coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. Jackson, whose last coaching stint with the Golden State Warriors ended in 2014, played for the Knicks from 1987-1992 and then again in 2001 and 2002. Hornacek, 54, was hired to instill Jackson’s philosophies — namely, the triangle offense — and compete for a spot in the playoffs. Perry, who was hired last summer as Jackson’s replacement, kept him to maintain a level of continuity in hopes of retooling around Porzingis, the Knicks’ sole franchise player. Before Christmas, the Knicks had a 16-14 record and making the playoffs seemed feasible. At the time, Porzingis was averaging 24 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. But the Knicks began to struggle around the New Year and Porzingis suffered a season-ending knee injury on Feb. 6 when the team was in the middle of an eight-game losing streak. New York’s focus shifted to maximizing its lottery odds. If Hornacek entered the season in a difficult spot because Jackson had departed, his position became untenable once Porzingis was injured and New York began to slide. Since the end of January, the Knicks are 5-26 and Hornacek got into a physical altercation with Noah at a practice. After the incident, Noah was kept away from the team for the rest of the season but the tension recalled earlier locker room friction that had contributed to Hornacek’s departure as coach of the Phoenix Suns 46 games into the 2016 season. Hornacek’s successor will need to build a more functional culture around a young core that features Porzingis, Frank Ntilikina and the team’s upcoming first-round draft pick.

Sarah Perez,"Alexa continues to make its way to the TV – going beyond attached players like Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Sticker or the Fire TV Edition televisions. At CES, a number of TV manufacturers announced their plans to integrate Amazon’s voice-controlled smart assistant into their own sets, either for the first time or as an expansion on earlier efforts, including Hisense, Sony and LG. Ahead of CES, Hisense announced Alexa would come to select models of its 2018 4K Smart TVs for the first time, including the 100″ 4K Ultra HD Smart Laser TV. With Alexa built-in, the smart TVs let you doing thing like launch apps, play music through services like iHeartRadio and Pandora, control the smart home, get movie recommendations, order from Amazon.com or take advantage of Alexa’s third-party apps, called skills, using your voice, and more. The Hisense TVs will also let you use Alexa to control their hardware – like changing the volume or switching inputs. LG, meanwhile, had previously announced select 2018 TVs would include a built-in Google Assistant to accept voice commands from the remote. These sets let you search info from the electronic program guide – meaning you could command it to turn the TV off when a show ends or search for a movie soundtrack, for example. The TVs also work with Google Home smart speakers. This week, LG showed off its new Google Assistant-controlled TVs, but noted that the TVs will work with Alexa, as well, via an LG skill and a device like the Echo smart speaker. Sony is doing something similar, as well. Sony previously offered some 2016 and 2017 Android TVs with support for Alexa, and is now expanding that support to its new 2018 TVs as well. Specifically, Sony announced two new and expanded 4K HRD TV series, the X900F series and A8F Bravia OLED series. The former aims to meet customer demand for larger screens with a range of sizes: 85” Class, 75’’ Class, 65’’ Class, 55’’ Class and 49’’ Class. The bigger screen sizes mean the need for improved technology to manage blur in fast-moving screens. Sony’s X-Motion Clarity technology addresses this by using Sony’s proprietary direct LED panel local dimming algorithm to control the luminance and optimize its duration. The new A8F Bravia series builds on the the first large-screen Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, the A1E, to include Sony’s 4K HDR picture Processor X1TM Extreme and Acoustic SurfaceTM technology, for improved picture quality and sound. Like LG, the Sony TVs themselves come with Google Assistant built-in, but they work with other smart speakers, like Sony’s own LF-S50G, in addition to Google Home and Amazon Echo line. It’s interesting to see these TV makers taking a hybrid approach to how their sets will work with smart speakers and voice technology. While Amazon uses Alexa in its own media players, these companies are instead taking advantage of Google Assistant – which is arguably better at search – then, adding Alexa support as a third-party integration of sorts. While these TV makers are making CES 2018 announcements, Alexa works with other partners in the TV industry, often by the way of add-on skills. In addition to Sony, for example, BenQ and Logitech also have Alexa skills.","Alexa continues to make its way to the TV – going beyond attached players like Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Sticker or the Fire TV Edition televisions.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Sarah Perez,"Messenger Kids, Facebook’s new app designed to allow those under the age of 13 to more safely communicate thanks to parental controls, is today launching on Fire tablets. The service had originally debuted on iPad, iPhone and iPod touch in early December, but today’s launch will also see it arrive on the Amazon Appstore in the U.S., as well. The app’s debut has not been without controversy. The move comes at a difficult time for Facebook and for social media in general, where there are increasing concerns about social media’s ability to addict adults, and the impact that screen time has on children in particular. Just this week, for example, Apple responded to investor concerns that the company needs to do more in terms of giving parents a way to limit children’s phone use. Apple said it would add new parental control features to its software. Facebook, meanwhile, has been criticized across a number of fronts over the past year or so, from its ability to spread disinformation and create divides to how it’s able to hijack users’ brains to create an addiction of sorts. In that light, the launch of Messenger Kids has been criticized as the equivalent of cigarette marketers targeting underage smokers. That said, as a parent myself, it’s one of those things that’s not as simple to dismiss as you might think. The truth is, young kids are messaging each other anyway – through apps like Musical.ly, Snapchat and on iMessage. None of these have any tools for parental controls, which actually makes it harder to for parents who do try to monitor their children’s usage of devices and communication software when they’re young. It’s very difficult today to help guide kids to the online world – and, yet, it’s still something that has to be done. Though we may not like it at times, the web is not going to go away, nor will people all of a sudden stop communicating and networking online. Facebook, at least, has done something – even as the major tech companies, like Apple, have ignored parents’ concerns for years on this front. Whether Facebook is the right company to aid in this matter, however, is a valid question. Its interests, after all, are about developing a new generation of users who become reliant on its platform, so it can continue to grow its ad business to the tune of billions. The new Fire tablet version of Messenger Kids is here.","Messenger Kids, Facebook’s new app designed to allow those under the age of 13 to more safely communicate thanks to parental controls, is today launching on Fire tablets.

GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Photo Stephen Colbert compared President Trump to a fire chief who “keeps tweeting, ‘Fake news. We don’t know that that’s a fire. Could be a very shiny flood.’” Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. ‘There’s No Doubt’ Stephen Colbert is outraged that the Trump administration has not authorized the National Security Agency to fully investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Mike Rogers, the head of the N.S.A., said he was still waiting for the president to give him the authority to look into Russian interference more deeply. Colbert took Trump to task, making a reference to his tweetstorm earlier that day, in which the president called the continuing Russia investigation a “witch hunt.” “The president has not told the National Security Agency to secure the nation against Russian hacking that we know is still happening. It’s like if your house is on fire, and the firemen are all there, and they agree that the flames are presently consuming your center hall colonial, but the fire chief keeps tweeting, ‘Fake news. We don’t know that that’s a fire. Could be a very shiny flood. Point is, there’s no proof of combustion. Witch hunt!’” — STEPHEN COLBERT Video by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert “There’s no doubt in any of the intelligence agencies that Russia did everything it could to influence the 2016 election — from effective methods, like Facebook ads and Twitter bots, to total dead ends, like Don Jr.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Trump 2020 Trump's Running for Re-Election, Live-Action Dora the Explorer - Monologue Video by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Fallon responded sarcastically to the news that Trump is already planning for 2020. “President Trump is expected to announce that he’s running for re-election in 2020.

Sarah Perez,"Fire TV Cube owners can now use their media streaming device to broadcast announcements around the home, similar to a one-way intercom. Amazon says it’s launching a feature called “Alexa Announcements,” which allows customers to speak to Alexa on the Fire TV Cube, then have their message announced in their own voice to all other Alexa-enabled devices in their household. For example, you could announce that “the movie is about to start,” or say “Alexa, tell everyone that dinner is ready,” and have the message sent to your Echo devices or other compatible Alexa-enabled devices registered to your Amazon account. To issue your broadcast, you preface it by saying either “Alexa, announce…,” “Alexa tell everyone…,” or “Alexa broadcast…”, Amazon notes. In addition to being able to send out announcements yourself, the Fire TV Cube starting this month will also support announcements that are broadcast from select smart home devices – specifically, those where the doorbell is ringing or motion is detected. In this case, Alexa will announce things like “motion detected at the front door” or “someone is at the front door,” and you can respond by saying “Alexa, show me the front door” to see your camera feed displayed on your TV. You can customize which smart home announcements you’d like to see through the new Alexa Announcements section in the Alexa app. Amazon didn’t say if or when the feature would come to other Fire TV devices. However, this is not the first time the Fire TV Cube has been updated with a feature its other media players others don’t have. In October, the Fire TV Cube was updated with a feature that allows you to use Alexa to navigate inside apps like Netflix and Hulu, which is especially helpful for accessibility purposes. It aids those with limited dexterity in their hands and fingers by allowing them to navigate by voice instead of pushing buttons. But it can also help if you’ve just misplaced the remote. The Alexa Announcements feature is rolling out now to all Fire TV Cube customers in the U.S.","Fire TV Cube owners can now use their media streaming device to broadcast announcements around the home, similar to a one-way intercom.

Loren Grush,"As long as the government shutdown continues, SpaceX won’t be able to test fire the company’s new Falcon Heavy rocket. The company needs support from the US Air Force to do the test, but too many personnel are furloughed and cannot help SpaceX conduct the firing. And that means the company can’t yet set a definitive launch date for the Falcon Heavy’s first flight, which was targeted for the end of January. The Falcon Heavy is supposed to fly from a historic site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral Florida, called LC-39A. It’s the same pad that was used to launch the Apollo missions to the Moon, as well as numerous Space Shuttle flights. And right now, SpaceX is gearing up to do an important test at the site called a static fire. It involves firing up all 27 engines on the Falcon Heavy while the vehicle is on the launchpad to go through the important first steps of flight, such as loading propellant and engine ignition. The static fire should tell SpaceX whether or not the rocket is ready to fly, and if the test is deemed a success, the company will likely set a target launch date. it looks like that test will have to wait However, it looks like that test will have to wait until the government shutdown is over. Because of the pad’s location, SpaceX relies on support from the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing, which oversees launches and operations at both KSC and the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The 45th Space Wing is responsible for making sure people on the ground are safe during launches and tests, for instance. But the 45th says it can’t do these crucial tasks during the shutdown. “Due to the shutdown removing key members of the civilian workforce, the 45th Space Wing will not be able to support commercial static fires taking place on KSC,” a spokesperson for the 45th Space Wing said in a statement to The Verge. “Without our civilian workforce, the 45th SW is unable to support launch operations as well.” SpaceX originally thought the shutdown would not impact its schedule, but the company later confirmed to The Verge that the shutdown does indeed delay the test of the Falcon Heavy. “This shutdown impacts SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy demonstration, which is critical for future [national security space] missions,” John Taylor, a SpaceX spokesperson, said in a statement to The Verge. SpaceX has been trying to do a static fire in January, with the goal of flying at the end of the month. However, the test keeps getting pushed, making a February launch more likely — and now the furlough could push the flight even further. And it’s not just the test that will be delayed, but future SpaceX flights that rely on Air Force personnel. “[The shutdown] also impacts critical missions for our customers, including important international allies, scheduled to launch shortly from Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, as well as upcoming missions this spring to resupply the International Space Station.” SpaceX’s next launch is scheduled for the end of January out of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, when the company will be sending up a communications satellite to be used by the government of Luxembourg. Fortunately, the Senate is supposed to vote Monday at noon ET on a new spending bill that could temporarily fund the government, so it’s possible that SpaceX will be able to get back to normal operations soon. But in the meantime, the engines will stay silent at Cape Canaveral.",SpaceX can’t test-fire its Falcon Heavy rockets which make a January launch unlikely.,2018-01-22T12:30:24Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Shutdown means SpaceX can’t test its Falcon Heavy rocket, creating further delays",https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/22/16918464/spacex-falcon-heavy-rocket-static-fire-delayed-shutdown,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qz6ig3HhfgfcA-BolgKoYKzMfBk=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10074817/38583831555_9ae89f5c10_o.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fire,1
David Lumb,"Another unnamed HI-EMA official has quit before facing disciplinary action and a fourth employee was suspended without pay, but it isn't clear yet what either of their roles were in the fiasco. As state and FCC investigations into the vents of January 13th have revealed, the fired officer wasn't required to check with a colleague or get managerial approval before sending the emergency blast to mobile phones, TV and radio stations across the state. There weren't safeguards in place to prevent one employee from erroneously warning the whole state on their own, an FCC staffer told Time. The test and real alerts used the exact same prompts and language, which ended up confusing the fired officer. Further, the state didn't have procedures to correct mistaken alerts at all. The messaging disaster served as a grim dry run that revealed a widespread unpreparedness to handle if, and when, this emergency warning system went awry. This was the sobering lesson the exiting HI-EMA administrator Miyagi left in a statement sent out by the agency on his behalf, which read in part: ""To the people of Hawaii, recent events have cast a bright light on our emergency preparedness, and caused many of you to consider whether you are ready for the emergencies we will surely face. Don't let that feeling pass without taking action. Here it is from me one last time: Know where to go, what to do, and when to do it. Have a plan. Be safe, and know that whatever happens, good and courageous people will be there to help.""","On January 13th, an officer of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA) triggered a missile alert that plunged residents statewide into temporary chaos before the alarm was called off as a mistake.

Saqib Shah,"The app scans body temperature during the menstrual cycle to notify women when it is safe to have unprotected sex. Days when it's okay are marked as green on its calendar, but if it shows red couples are advised to use an extra form of protection. It's own research suggests Natural Cycles is more effective than the contraceptive pill when used correctly. The 37 unwanted pregnancy cases stem from a study of over 600 women who sought abortions at Södersjukhuset hospital from September 2017 until the end of the year. ""We have a duty to report all side effects, such as pregnancies, to the Medical Products Agency,"" midwife Carina Montin told Siren news agency. The findings could come as a blow to Natural Cycles' plans to gain FDA approval. In a statement, Natural Cycles said: ""No contraception is 100 per cent and unwanted pregnancies is an unfortunate risk with any contraception. ""To have 37 unwanted pregnancies out of the 668 mentioned in this study at Södersjukhuset means that 5,5 per cent of women who stated they used Natural Cycles also had an unwanted pregnancy. This is in line with what we communicate as the risk of unwanted pregnancy with typical use, and which is comparable to other types of contraception."" In February Natural Cycles became the first app to be certified for contraceptive use, following approval by Germany's Department of Health, after which its UK users spiked from 5,000 to 125,000. In November, the app, founded by husband and wife duo Dr. Raoul Scherwitzl and Dr. Elina Berglund, snagged $30 mIllion in funding.","A contraceptive app used by more than 500,000 women has come under fire after reportedly causing 37 unwanted pregnancies.

Tom McKay,"Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday. According to the report, Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden brought up the throttling in an addendum to a multi-state legal brief seeking the overturn of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission’s decision to throw out Barack Obama-era net neutrality rules. Bowden alleged that Verizon had throttled a SIM card connecting a fire department mobile command vehicle named “OES 5262” to 1/200th of its normal speed, putting lives and property at risk, and that the company’s support team refused to lift the restrictions until fire officials purchased a new data plan at “more than twice the cost.” Ars Technica wrote: “County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,” Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. “This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” Bowden’s declaration was submitted in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules in a lawsuit they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. According to Bowden, County Fire IT staff verified the connection was being throttled, which “severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively.” When those staff reached out and said the throttling was impacting public safety, Verizon customer support personnel confirmed they had deliberately limited OES 5262's connection, but that it would only be restored if County Fire switched to a more expensive plan and contacted the billing department. As a result, fire personnel were forced to use other departments’ service providers as well as their personal devices until County Fire paid up. Bowden wrote those personnel were deployed to help fight the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in the state. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fire is extremely hazardous to the nearly 3,500 firefighters currently fighting it, with Draper City, Utah fire department Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett dying this month while trying to help contain the blaze. In general, the blazes across the state have increasingly exhibited extreme behavior like immense fire tornadoes. Adding a service provider dispute to this situation is indisputably not helpful. Bowden further alleged that Verizon knew full well what it was doing and took advantage of the situation to “coerce” County Fire into paying more: While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. In a statement provided to Gizmodo as well as Ars Technica, a Verizon spokesperson wrote that the company “made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,” which was a “government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost.” The spokesperson wrote that while the plan offers “unlimited amount of data... speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle”—though they added that Verizon maintains “a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations” and the incident was a “customer support mistake.” Verizon also stated that the matter had “nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.” It’s true that throttling a plan that goes over its data limits isn’t a net neutrality issue per se. The Obama-era rules prohibited service providers from artificially slowing down or blocking content in a discriminatory fashion, whether it’s to limit their customers’ access to rival services or just charge extortionate fees to access certain services. But Bowden’s argument appears to be that County Fire’s experience with Verizon led him to believe they are quite willing to do just that to emergency personnel. “Please work with us,” a fire official wrote to Verizon on July 30th, according to documents filed with Bowden’s addendum. “All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.” [ Ars Technica ]","Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday.

Brian Heater,"Amazon’s Fire tablets have been doing the Alexa thing for a while now, slowly improving the experience update by update. A new version of the Fire HD 8 tablet takes everything a step further with the addition of an always-on, fully hands-free assistant experience. When the setting is enabled, you can summon Alexa, even with the tablet in standby mode. The new slate also, naturally, has the recently introduced Show Mode, which brings an Echo Show-like experience to the product when docked. The company is further blurring the line between product categories — but that’s never really been an issue for Amazon. It clearly has little concern how people get Alexa, just so long as they’re using the product. The combination of hands-free Alexa and Show Mode is just another point of entry for the increasingly saturated smart home. The new device also features a 10-hour battery, quad-core proccessor, 1280 x 800 display and 16GB/32GB of storage. Not exactly high-end specs here, but it’s an $80 device. Cheap is kind of the whole point of the Fire tablets, these days. There’s also a $130 Kids Edition of the tablet, featuring a drop-friendly bumper and the standard software subscription package.

Jack Stewart,"The largest and most destructive fire burning in California continues to grow, consuming dry brush as it races not just through but across the canyons north of Los Angeles. Strong winds and dry conditions mean flames can leap large distances, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. The Thomas Fire has now spread from Ventura County into Santa Barbara County, burning up 230,000 acres—an area larger than New York City and Boston combined. The out of control blaze is on track to become one of the largest in California history. So firefighters are using the largest tools they have to tackle it, including one that’s more than 200 feet long, and does its work from just 200 feet above the ground. “We avoid flying through smoke at all costs, but you can smell the fire 200 miles out, even at 20,000 feet,” says Marcos Valdez, one of the pilots of the Global Supertanker, a Boeing 747 modified to fight the fiercest of fires. The jumbo jet can drop 19,200 gallons of fire retardant liquid per trip, nearly double the capacity of the next largest air tanker, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Fully stocked, the plane weighs in at 660,000 pounds, comfortably under its 870,000-pound max takeoff weight. Step inside (which you can do in the interactive 3-D model below) and you’ll see that the upper floor looks pretty normal, with the cockpit and a few seats. Head down the stairs to the main floor, though, and you’ll see the key changes its owner, Global Supertanker LLC, made when it converted the Japan Airlines passenger plane to a firefighter in 2016: In what looks like the interior of a submarine, you’ll find eight cylindrical white tanks in two rows. Holding the fire suppressant liquid in separate tanks means the 747, aka The Spirit of John Muir, can make up to eight segmented drops on multiple small fires, or put down a solid two miles of fire line, to try to protect property or contain a fire. The liquid drops through a big hose, through a series of manhole-cover-sized circular nozzles under the plane, near the back. (If you use the “Dollhouse” view on the 3-D model, you can see some of that detail on the very lower deck.) The plane is based in Colorado Springs, but its owner contracts it out to fire agencies in need. This week it’s flying out of Sacramento, in the northern part of the state. That’s because it can carry so much flame retardant that picking it up in Southern California wouldn’t leave enough for the smaller aerial firefighters. Plus, with a 600-mph cruise speed, it can reach the perimeter of the Thomas fire in just 38 minutes. The 747 and other fixed wing aircraft sat out the early days of the fight against these fires, because high wind speeds would have blown their liquid retardant unpredictably off course. Though the pink stuff won’t damage people or property ( good news for this guy ), pilots make an effort to avoid dumping it on firefighters on the ground. The 747 can actually lay such a long line of retardant that it can be used to draw a line to safety for people trapped in a “burn-over” situation, where flames threaten to engulf them. When the Supertanker reaches a fire, it doesn’t just drop down and fire away. The whole operation is a carefully orchestrated affair. Valdez, the pilot, starts by flying at 1,000 feet up, watching a “show me” flight by a lead plane, usually a Rockwell OV-10 Bronco or Beechcraft King Air. That has likely been in the air for hours, and directs each tanker aircraft exactly where to make its drops, pointing out hazards like power lines or tall rocks over the radio. “They’re using signals like ‘Start at this tree that’s split,’ ‘Fly on the right flank of the fire,’ and ‘I want to you stop at this rock that looks like a bear,’” Valdez says. Then Valdez pushes the yoke forward until he and his crew are flying 200 to 300 feet above the ground—in a jet whose wingspan is just over 200 feet. Valdez plays down the terror, comparing it to driving next to a concrete barrier down the center of a highway. You know it’s there, and that one wrong move could kill you, but you just keep your heading and your cool. The whole drop is over in 10 minutes, and then it’s time to head back to Sacramento, making for a two-hour roundtrip.

Brian Heater,"Surprise! Amazon’s holding a big hardware event at its Seattle headquarters, and we’re here on site, to bring you the news as it breaks. Unlike Apple, Google and the like, the company isn’t one for announcing these sorts of events in advance, though given that it’s done something similar in recent years, it seemed likely that it had something big planned for this month. After all, we are in the pre-holiday crunch time for hardware launches. That’s precisely why you’ve seen/will see major events from competitors like Apple, Google and Microsoft, among others. It’s also why I haven’t been sleeping very much this month. I wouldn’t read too much into the fact that Amazon didn’t pre-announce the event. That’s just the company’s style, for whatever reason. And besides, it took a similar approach with last year’s event, where it refreshed the Echo line and added the Spot, Buttons and a new Fire TV to the stable. What we do know for sure is that today’s event will be focused on Alexa, the Echo line and Fire TV. As far as specifics, this report seems like a pretty good place to start. It notes that the company is planning to release “at least” eight Alexa hardware devices in the near future, including a hi-fi system, an automotive gadget and, interestingly, an Alexa-powered microwave. All of the above are interesting for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that they would put the company in direct competition with a number of third-party hardware partners, including Sonos, Garmin and GE. That runs counter to the company’s recent pattern of working with third parties. A number of other Amazon products seem overdue for refreshes as well, including the Echo Show and Dot. There’s been talk of a HomePod-style competitor from Amazon, as well. That could potentially make its debut at today’s event, as well, though the Sonos-esque product may also fit the bill there.","Surprise!

Jessi Hempel,"A year ago, The Intercept published a story about a Trump campaign affiliate that was circulating personality tests to collect Americans’ personal information. The company, called Cambridge Analytica, had already been unveiled by the Guardian in a chilling report that detailed its voter-targeting operation. There was every reason to be concerned. These revelations arrived in the midst of a year in which aggressive political campaigning, concerns over fake news, and the rise of bots that spread propaganda gave us reason to question the kinds of information we were handing over to third party applications, like Facebook, and how this freespun data deluge might come back to bite us in the ass. But this awareness of Cambridge Analytica, and their covert manipulation of our data, didn’t coalesce into rage until late Friday night, when the words of a pink-haired, gay, vegan Canadian hit a cultural nerve. At 28, Christopher Wylie agreed to talk, he told The Guardian, out of a sense of guilt. Four years earlier, Wylie says he came up with the idea to pull big data and social media to fuel a form of information warfare: an idea that led to the creation of Cambridge Analytica. Coming forward involved breaking a nondisclosure agreement, yet Wylie did it, he explained, because he felt morally conflicted. “I assumed it was entirely legal and above board,” he told The Guardian. But he’d helped to create a weapon, and he was ready, as best he could, to participate in its dismantling. Judging by content alone, Wiley’s reckoning doesn’t make for a huge news moment ; the details he reveals about the inner workings of Cambridge Analytica have, for the most part, already been disclosed by investigative reporters. But Wiley triggered something that countless news stories weren’t able to: A latent rage that may lay the groundwork for a movement that demands accountability from Facebook. The unchecked power of companies that harvest our data is a great problem—but it’s hard to get angry about an idea that’s so nebulous. Like climate change, the reaping of our data is a problem of psychology as much as business. We know that the accumulation of massive power in so few hands is bad, but it’s impossible to anticipate what terrible result might come of it. And if we could envision them, these consequences are imaginary: abstract and in the future. It feels so oppressively intractable it’s hard to summon the will to act. Like climate change, the reaping of our data is a problem of psychology as much as business. Even if we could act, the options aren’t great. Except for the very very rich, or the extraordinarily poor, participating in the economy requires leaving a digital footprint. Most of us scroll through privacy terms on the sites we use without reading them, and accept updates without noticing or understanding the consequences. We all know we’ve been compromised already. In a flash, Wylie’s story made the idea of misused big data concrete—and urgent. Unlike, say, Phillip Morris, which sold a product that directly caused people to get cancer, the problems of big tech are abstract enough that they require people to illustrate their impact. Wylie is just one in a small-but-growing cadre of digital whistleblowers who have come of age in the early decades of the Internet, and played a hand in helping tech companies and government institutions harness the power of the data that has emerged, and now regret their roles. Former CIA employee and government contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified information from the National Security Agency in 2013 because he said he was concerned about global surveillance techniques. Tristan Harris rose to become a design ethicist at Google before he left in 2016, and concerned that technology companies design addictive software applications, began a campaign to produce technology that is good for people. Former Facebook product manager (and current Wired columnist) Antonio Garcia Martinez helped develop advertising at Facebook; now he speaks out, after writing a book about his experience. Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube engineer, detailed his concerns about the platform’s recommendation algorithm to the Guardian earlier this year. Wylie, like a lot of these whistleblowers, doesn't come across great in the Guardian piece. He's young. He's silly. He used his new Twitter account, which he only just started Friday, to complain that now he’s been booted off Instagram. Like a lot of engineers, he didn't really care much about ethics when he was creating programs that would redefine ethical boundaries. But that only enhances his case: it provides a window into how little oversight goes into making the tools that have influenced our political system, and by extension, shaken our democracy. It’s difficult for any of us to understand where our information goes and how it’s used. Companies and governments are rarely transparent about collecting personal information. Even when they are, their data privacy measures can be lax. While Facebook told The Intercept last year that it had asked Cambridge Analytica to delete its data, Wylie said he’d received exactly one email from Facebook asking him to delete. “All I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” Wylie told The Guardian. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.” Wylie may follow in the footsteps of the Cassandras who’ve come before him, parlaying his moment of public attention into a book deal or public speaking platform that raises his own profile more than it helps force a reckoning. But Wylie will not be the last of these digital whistle-blowers. Indeed, his story will likely galvanize a group waiting in the wings. The challenge, however, is how to use this moment to summon the will to lean on governments and companies to better protect individuals before this moment passes completely, and we must wait for the next whistleblower to give us reason to pay attention.

SARAH PAPE,"The church gymnasium were currently working in is partitioned one end providing hot drinks and snacks as the other three quarters are crowded with people on cots and air mattresses, many of them medically fragile.

The television murmurs around the clock, camp chairs pulled close to it as people stare half-vacantly at the screen. We can scarcely tear ourselves away from it, as if in the absence of our watching eyes, the death toll will even further grow. Shock and smoked-out lungs dull the voices of evacuees as they impart their escape tales and list their lost inventory. Heroic stories and near-death accounts emerge in equal measure nurses who fled with their patients, taking refuge in an abandoned garage and finding spare hoses to fight the fire off; schoolteachers piling students into their cars; and so much more. What emerges, too, is a troubling sign of working- and middle-class challenges compounded by disaster: people on Social Security or disability, people with no insurance, people with nowhere else to go. In this increasingly expensive swath of California, Paradise was one of the last places where you could live on a fixed income. Hospitals, rehab centers, convalescent homes and community pharmacies dotted its main roads. Less than two months ago, the local county declared a shelter crisis.

Cameron Faulkner,"The biggest products to hit this week include the iPhone XR, Apple’s more affordable twist on the iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones, and Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar’s prequel that’s driving a ton of deals on consoles. If you’re not after either of those — or if you’ve already bought them — there are plenty of other deals that are worth rummaging through as we inch closer to the holidays. Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available for the PS4 and Xbox One. Sony’s PS4 Pro bundle with the game included is old news at this point, but this week saw big price drops on Xbox One consoles at a variety of retailers, both online and in store. Here are a few of the best bundles that are $100 off: Xbox One X with Fallout 76 and Red Dead Redemption 2 is $459.99 at GameStop (usually $559.99, preordered console will ship November 16th) Xbox One X bundled with Red Dead Redemption 2, a free wired controller, and $5 Xbox gift card is $459 at Walmart (usually $583.96) Xbox One S bundled with Red Dead Redemption 2, a free wired controller, and $5 Xbox gift card is $259 at Walmart (usually $383.96) Xbox One S with Battlefield V is $259.99 at Amazon (usually $359.99, though you need to manually add Red Dead Redemption 2 to cart to see the discount) Amazon Amazon has discounted its lineup of Fire Kids Edition tablets, and you can save up to $40 if you have your eye on the largest Fire 10 HD Kids Edition tablet. No matter which size piques your interest, each comes with a microSD slot for easy storage expansion, a bouncy case that will protect it, a year subscription to kid-friendly content, and a no-fuss two-year warranty. Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet is $79.99 (usually $99.99) In case you don’t want to spend close to $120 on a Google Home, Insignia’s smart Bluetooth speaker is a more practical option that’s deeply discounted. It, too, packs in Google Assistant functionality and a practical alarm clock that displays the time. Insignia Voice smart Bluetooth speaker is $19.99 at Best Buy (usually $99.99) Buying over-ear noise-canceling headphones that are worth the money is usually an expensive endeavor. If you’re hoping to spend less than $50, Taotronics is offering Verge readers a special discount on its affordable noise-canceling headphones.

Lucas Matney,"Amazon is looking to sell its Fire TV Edition smart televisions in a big box store, but thankfully it’s not Whole Foods. Instead, Amazon will be tapping a retailer whose life it has made incredibly difficult over the years, Best Buy, to begin selling smart televisions with its Fire TV capabilities baked in. The displays from Toshiba and Best Buy’s own Insignia brand will come in 4K and HD varieties, with Best Buy exclusively partnering with Amazon to sell more than ten models of TVs starting this summer. “Amazon and Best Buy have a long history of working together, and today we take our partnership to a new level,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. There are a host of smart TVs already being sold at Best Buy stores, Amazon’s Fire TV products do pretty much everything that those do, but the direction integration of Alexa which can be used with the included remote control is definitely a major selling point. Buying a TV remains one of the few technology purchases where an in-store visit feels pretty essential. Reviews are only so helpful and as resolutions climb, viewers need to see 4K televisions in real life to see if it’s something they need. Even as the prices have come down on the large screens, Best Buy has continued to devote a sizable section of their store space to TV gallery-viewing. Though Amazon’s growth has been well-documented in the last several years, Best Buy has also had a surprising amount of success on Wall Street with the company more than doubling its share price in the past two years.","Amazon is looking to sell its Fire TV Edition smart televisions in a big box store, but thankfully it’s not Whole Foods.

PETER EAVIS,"On Thursday, the company said it was stepping up equipment inspections in areas that regulators have identified as having a high fire risk. We recognize that more must be done to adapt to and address the increasing threat of wildfires and extreme weather in order to keep our customers and communities safe, John Simon, PG&amp;Es interim chief executive, said in a statement.
PG&amp;E said its bankruptcy filing was meant to protect it from becoming overwhelmed by its wildfire liabilities. But some investors said PG&amp;E did not need bankruptcy protection because it earns enough money to pay the wildfire claims as they come due. PG&amp;Es shares, which have more than doubled in recent weeks, were down about 1.5 percent on Thursday morning.
The company has already used its bankruptcy filing to halt payments to some wildfire victims. PG&amp;E has stopped making payments for claims from the 2015 Butte Fire. But the fire does not appear to pose a large financial burden to the company. In the fourth quarter, PG&amp;E recorded legal costs of $9 million for the Butte fire, a fraction of the expenses from the other fires.
Due to recent wildfire-related lawsuits and the subsequent financial uncertainty surrounding them, PG&amp;E has stopped making settlement offers to individual plaintiffs at this time, the company said in an email message. Under the Chapter 11 process, any Butte Fire settlements that have not been paid will be addressed in the bankruptcy case.","The remnants of mobile homes in Paradise, Calif., after the Camp Fire.

Chaim Gartenberg,"Amazon is now including its upgraded Alexa voice remote with its entry-level $39.99 Fire TV Stick, replacing the old, basic remote that the company previously included. The Alexa voice remote for Fire TVs adds a bunch of new and useful features to the streaming device — specifically, the ability to directly control things like power, volume, and mute on your TV without having to fumble around for another remote, thanks to the inclusion of IR blasters. Amazon has already offered the upgraded remote bundled in with the $49.99 Fire TV Stick 4K and $119.99 Fire TV Cube, but it has charged an extra $29.99 for owners of the regular Fire TV stick to upgrade. Bundling the better remote in the box makes more sense, although it sadly won’t be too helpful for anyone who already owns a Fire TV Stick.","Amazon is now including its upgraded Alexa voice remote with its entry-level $39.99 Fire TV Stick, replacing the old, basic remote that the company had included.",2019-01-15T15:50:33Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Amazon’s Fire TV stick now comes with a remote that can control your TV,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/15/18183654/amazon-fire-tv-stick-alexa-voice-remote-ir-blaster-tv-control-bundle-in-box,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRInQOLFiEIzBiCC1Kw_2CJoNP4=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13360399/cwelch_181030_3054_0445.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fire,1
Adam Clark Estes,"Amazon Fire TV has always been one of my favorite gadgets. The Amazon Echo, as I’ve previously explained, gives me pause. So when I heard that Amazon was combining Fire TV with Alexa capabilities to create a whole new device called the Amazon Fire TV Cube, my first thought seemed peculiar: Uh oh, people are gonna love this. The $120 Amazon Fire TV Cube makes up for its wordy name by doing a lot. Its primary feature involves controlling your TV and the Amazon Fire TV software with your voice. Amazon has programmed a whole host of new capabilities that not only let you turn on your TV and turn up the volume but also navigate between channels and find content on channels like Netflix and Hulu through Amazon Fire TV. The Cube itself is equipped with a linear array of eight microphones similar to the circular array on the Echo, so that Alexa can hear your commands even when the TV is playing. So you can say, “Alexa, show me scifi movies,” and a numbered grid scifi movies will appear on the screen. You can make your selection either by saying the number of by saying the name of the movie. Importantly, you can also use your TV or a Fire TV remote to control the TV by pointing them at the device. The commands also work with live TV services as well as regular old cable boxes. Secondary to turning your voice into a remote control, the Fire TV Cube also works the illegitimate lovechild of a $30 Echo Dot and a $150 Echo Show. It’s an Alexa-powered speaker (emphasis on the Alexa, not the speaker) that will answer your questions and obey your commands. Do you have the Alexa skill setup for your Philips Hue lights? Then the Fire TV Cube is capable of hearing your command and turning on the lights. Big whoop. An Echo Dot does that just fine. But if you ask the Fire TV Cube about the weather, it can show you the forecast on the TV. There are various other Echo Show-like skills that people might enjoy seeing on their home’s biggest screen. So I’m thinking, on one hand, Amazon is making it super cheap and easy to get rid of my clanky bundle of TV remotes. Other companies, most recently Sonos, are offering the same thing in the form of smart sound bars, most of which use Alexa technology. But the Sonos sound bar costs more than twice what the Cube costs and offers flexibility when combining your existing components. On the other hand, Amazon is asking you to put another always-on Alexa device in your home. That’s totally cool if you’re part of the very large Echo-loving community! It might also make some people nervous to talk to Alexa every time they wanted to change the channel. After all, the Cube represents an uniquely new way to talk to Alexa and integrate her powers into your daily life. The artificially intelligent assistant gets better all the time, but it does make some weird mistakes sometimes. It was only a couple weeks ago that we learned about an Echo that sent a private conversation to a couple’s colleague not because of a hacker but because of a series of coincidences as well as some shortcomings in Alexa’s ability to understand human voices. It’s a well known reality that gaining convenience can often mean losing some privacy or security. Everyone has to figure out their own version of that equation. Until I can get my hands on it for testing, I can’t say how convenient the Cube may be. A demo of the device (conducted by Amazon) did lead to me saying “Oh that seems handy” more than once. Some glitches did rear their heads, but that’s not unusual to see in a gadget that’s yet to reach the market. The Amazon Fire Cube TV is available for preorder today for $120. Prime members can get a $30 discount if they preorder one today or tomorrow. The devices start shipping on June 21. It’s a curios proposition, when you think about it. Being able to control your existing home entertainment system with special set-top features could be pretty cool. Plus, the extra stuff. The Cube does everything that a Fire TV does, everything that an Echo Dot does, some of the stuff that the Echo Show does, and some stuff that nothing else does. Yes, you will need to be a part of the Echo data circus to get access to all of that. Maybe you love doing that.","Amazon Fire TV has always been one of my favorite gadgets.

The retailer has also released a list of Prime Day deals, which encompasses other Amazon product discounts, as well as those from other manufacturers. This year’s Prime Day promises to be the largest yet, both in terms of the number of deals and the length of the sale itself, which has been stretched to 36 hours. Prime members will be able to shop over 1 million deals worldwide in an expanded number of international markets outside the U.S. That’s up from over 100,000 deals just two years ago, the retailer noted.

For example, the lowest price on the Fire TV Stick before today was $24.99 – now it’s $19.99. The Fire TV (Pendant) is also $10 less than it was during its biggest price drop. And even the brand-new Fire TV Cube has been marked down from $119.99 to $89.99. If you bundle it with a Cloud Cam, you can save $90 off both. Though oddly not in Amazon’s advertised list above, the Echo Dot is on sale, too. The smaller Echo speaker was last year’s best seller on Prime Day, and Amazon is clearly hoping to repeat history by marking down the Dot again. Last year, it was $34.99 on Prime Day, now it’s $29.99 – and one of the better deals to be found. The Echo with a screen – the Echo Show – has also been marked down from $229.99 to $129.99. A bundle of the Echo Plus and a Philips Hue Bulb – a good starter pack for the smart home – is on sale for $99.99. (The Echo Plus costs more than the $69.99 Echo, but you won’t need a separate smart home hub. It’s built-in.) The longer list of U.S. Prime Day deals is available here. Some of the highlights for TechCrunch readers include those in electronics and gaming, like savings on smart TVs; smart home products; headphones from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, and Nura; 3D printers; gaming laptops and desktops; and more. Prime members can shop deals via the website, Amazon app, and can set up Watch a Deal alerts to start watching deals up to 6 hours before they are live. There’s also a savings Easter egg in the Amazon app this year. If you open the app and tap on the camera icon to use one of its tools – like AR View, Product Search, Barcode Scanner or Package X-Ray – you can save $5 off the Prime Day deals you purchase in the app. You can do this every 6 hours for multiple $5 discounts, Amazon says.","Amazon is kicking off today’s Prime Day a bit early.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"Credit Noah Berger/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images In the 10 days since a massive forest fire erupted near Yosemite National Park, the size of the fire has roughly doubled to more than 33,740 acres. Officials said Monday that they are making progress fighting the Ferguson fire, but it has moved closer to the park. One firefighter was killed while battling the blaze, and six others have been injured. The fire is now about 13 percent contained and about two miles from the park. The smoke has blocked views of the valley inside the park and one of the most scenic routes, Glacier Point Road, has been closed to allow firefighters to assemble in the area. Officials have also closed Highway 140, one of the main routes into Yosemite, at the entrance of the park for about a mile and a half to the west.

While light winds offered a slight respite over the weekend, the rugged terrain and high temperatures make it unlikely the flames will die down anytime soon, said Scott McLean, the deputy chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “The vegetation is dry out there, and it’s so hot,” he said. “This fire will continue to grow.” Credit Noah Berger/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Firefighters are using bulldozers to create fire breaks inside the Stanislaus National Forest.

"Dan Merica, CNN","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will issue a new rule banning bump fire stocks, a gun accessory that makes it easier to fire rounds quickly from a semi-automatic weapon, mimicking automatic fire. The announcement comes a day before large numbers of protesters are expected to descend on Washington, DC for ""March for Our Lives,"" a rally organized to push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida last month. ""Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period,"" Trump wrote. ""We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."" Shortly after Trump's tweet, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would clarify rules that define bump stocks within the definition of ""machine gun"" under federal law, a move that would ban the sale of such accessories. Trump directed his attorney general to propose changes that would ban bump stocks in February. The move came four months after a gunman in Las Vegas used a bump stock to fire down on concertgoers, killing 58 people, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Republicans, in response to the Las Vegas shooting, blamed the Obama administration for the sale of bump stocks. ""Just a few moments ago I signed a memo directing the attorney general to propose regulations that ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,"" Trump said at a Medal of Valor event at the White House in February. ""I expect these regulations to be finalized, Jeff, very soon,"" Trump added. On Friday, a Department of Justice statement said if the rule change is made, bump stocks and similar devices would be ""required to surrender, destroy or otherwise render the devices permanently inoperable."" The public comment period on the rule is 90 days. ""After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress,"" Sessions said. This announcement is the near culmination in a process that has been ongoing for months. The initial proposal by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives drew more than 35,000 comments from the public, a number far more than usual, a sign of how contentious the issue has been. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time that Trump ""doesn't support use of those accessories."" Though bump stocks were not used in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, they were one of the proposals Trump backed in the wake of the deadly shooting. The President, in a series of emotional events, also proposed arming teachers and school staff -- a suggestion that was quickly slammed by pro-gun control and education groups -- and making it easier for judges to rule someone unfit to own a gun. Trump will not in be in Washington on Saturday during the march, organized in part by students from the Parkland, Florida high school, to protest US gun laws and school shootings. Some lawmakers have questioned whether a rule through the ATF goes far enough to banning certain gun accessories.","President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will issue a new rule banning bump fire stocks, a gun accessory that makes it easier to fire rounds quickly from a semi-automatic weapon, mimicking automatic fire.",2018-03-23T23:08:42Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Trump moves closer to banning bump-fire stocks,https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/politics/trump-bump-stocks/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180319104720-01-trump-speaking-file-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,fire,1
Laura Vitto,"Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26. The fire tornado was part of the Carr Fire that's engulfed 223,610 acres of land in Northern California so far. A report from Cal Fire breaks down the details surrounding the fiery phenomenon. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Per the report, the tornado ""was a large rotating fire plume that was roughly 1,000 feet in diameter at its base"" and managed to reach a height of 40,000 feet. In late July, we covered news of a fire tornado in the area on the evening of July 26. It's unclear whether the fire tornado in the report is the same as the one that garnered media attention at the time, according to Cal Fire. ""Observations from witnesses and other evidence suggest that either several fire tornados occurred at different locations and times, or one fire tornado formed and then periodically weakened and strengthened causing several separate damage areas,"" the report says. Fire tornados can happen when extreme heat spins up from the ground. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman explained at the time: ""The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself."" ""Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm."" Firefighters captured the disturbing video above from a helicopter, as well as footage taken from a fire engine, and from the Keswick Dam on the Sacramento River. The Carr Fire continues to ravage parts of Shasta County and Trinity County. It is 77 percent contained, and other fires continue to rage in Northern California and other areas These fires are spurred on by extreme heat and dryness in the region. While human-caused climate change isn't necessarily the direct cause of any single weather event, like these fires, it can make extreme weather more likely now and in the future.","Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26.

ANNIE CORREAL,"The day Mr. Buckel died, Mr. Morales received a text from him at 5:25 a.m. saying he wouldn’t be at work. At 5:55 a.m., he got the letter Mr. Buckel emailed to several news organizations. He was arriving at work and dismissed it at first, taking it for one of the news stories they’d exchange. “I sent him a text at 6:40 saying, ‘Please tell me that email is just a joke.’” Above the letter, there was a note. “I apologize for leaving this world early and leaving you with some big challenges to tackle,” it said. “You are ready. I am so proud of you and what you have accomplished, both in your professional and your personal life. It was an honor and a pleasure to serve the Earth with you.” Mr. Morales, not wanting to believe what he had read, showed it to a few other workers later that morning. He did a Google search for “self-immolation.” “It popped up — Prospect Park,” he said. “We just dropped to the ground.” Mr. Buckel chose to die not before thousands, but alone. He chose to do it at an early hour, perhaps so the sight of a burning man would be less likely to traumatize children, or be caught on video. Even the location, that forgettable strip of grass just off the road, seemed intended to disrupt life as little as possible. “I apologize to you for the mess,” he wrote in a note to the police, which was found with his letter in the shopping cart. He had stapled his business card to the letter, and left his identification on a lanyard nearby, to remove any doubt. He kept his cellphone with him, which was found in melted pieces by his body, along with a knife and some keys. Among the many unanswered questions about the death of David Buckel was why he had a folding shopping cart with him. There was no fuel canister in it, nothing but an empty black plastic bag — the kind he and Mr. Morales filled with the rich new soil made on their compost site. The earth around Mr. Buckel was burned in a nearly perfect circle. The police said the ground was too scorched to tell, but it is possible that when he went to Prospect Park that day, he took some soil with him, hauling it in the cart. It is possible Mr. Buckel’s last moments were spent spreading it out, making a ring around him, so the flames wouldn’t spread.","David Buckel, a gay rights lawyer turned master composter, was committed to fighting for social justice and the environment.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Everyone who fled the Camp Fire has a story about when they knew things were going to be very, very bad on that fateful Thursday that the flames tore through the town of Paradise and the surrounding region. Jeremy Veselys came when the spot fire on the ridge above his newly-built home went from smokey to tree-engulfing flames in 30 minutes. For Rachel Aradia, it hit when she saw the panic on her coworkers faces as she walked into work at Sundance Art Glass. Further south, Rebecca Gamettes moment of reckoning came when she went to feed the donkeys at 6:30 a.m. on her and her husbands Butte Valley property. The thick smell of smoke hung on the early morning air of like an unwelcome houseguest. When she saw the smoke plume hovering over Paradise 10 miles to the northeast, the place she had called home until 2008, it crystallized. Were in trouble, she told her husband. These are the stories that will be recounted in bars and at church services, retold to children and grandchildren. They hold power because theyre a clear demarcation line of before and after the fire that basically wiped the 27,000-person town off the map. And they could be what keeps a community together as thousands of people who lost everything try to decide what comes next. If Paradise the community still exists, the town that once was is gone. Until last week, it was a place like countless others across the West, sustained by a mix of retail, healthcare, and forestry as well as education courtesy of California State, Chico and Butte College in neighboring towns. The town featured a busy commercial strip that added a Starbucks last year, and a national forest just outside city limits. Paradise is considered part of the wildland-urban interface, the fastest growing type of land cover in the U.S. The growth of that interface means more American than ever are living in harms way when fires explode, an increasingly common phenomenon as the climate warms. But even if Paradise is an Everytown USA in one sense, whats happened there is also singularly horrific. At least 7,860 structures have been lost, according to the latest estimate from Cal Fire. The number has and will continue to rise as firefighters assess the aftermath there and the damage to surrounding communities like Magalia. Already the most destructive and deadliest fire in Californias history, the Camp Fire will almost certainly be a multi-billion dollar disaster. And the disaster area could be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Even those who still have houses will have a hard time going back if and when theyre allowed to. Roads are clogged with debris, power is out, and water is unsafe to drink. Research shows that nearly half of all homes are rebuilt in the wake of wildfires within five years. Its unclear if its typically community members or new developers doing the rebuilding. But the cost, emotional duress, and myriad challenges that crop up can create huge barriers. All with nothing remotely close to the scale and scope of the Camp Fires devastation in modern American history, all that research may now be out the window. Vesely, whose house survived the flames even as some of his neighbors houses did not, is currently staying about 80 miles south of Paradise in Roseville. But he said he and his wife are considering buying a trailer so they can be mobile over the coming monthssomething afforded to him thanks to working remotely for a software development companyto freely visit neighbors, friends, and members of his church who have been displaced. In a time where the world has been turned upside down, those human bonds are crucial for staying sane. We saw them last night and it was an amazing stress reliever, he said of his neighbors from Paradise. The weight was lifted off just by seeing and talking with them. Ironically, he and his wife built their house to serve as a meeting place for church members, but now theres no telling when theyll be able to gather again. He said his pastor has been checking in with people on Facebook, and its possible that they could use Facebook Live to hold services and retain some semblance of community. Gamettes house also survived. Though she has water in the form of a year-round spring, electricity is still out at her property so she cant access that water. Her plan is to head back with a generator in tow and live as best she can with that until power is restored. She knows her task is likely going to be easier than what her friends in Paradise face, though. I hope theyll find a way to stay and organize, she said. There is a spirit there, but there arent many businesses left. I dont know how people will support themselves in the meantime even trying to rebuild. In Chico, a town of 93,000 about 30 minutes down the road from Paradise, residents have welcomed survivors. The local food co-op gives out free soup and is handling shipments of food and supplies coming in from other co-ops around the state. The Chico Peace and Justice Center is collecting and distributing other items. Even a local tattoo shop is all-in on the support, distributing blankets and clothing to people who left Paradise with only the clothes on their backs. California is battling three simultaneous wildfires, which have destroyed almost 200,000 acres and Read more Read But the crushing reality is that thousands of people are now homeless, including Paradises entire town council. The Walmart parking lot in Chico has become a tent city. And with up to 10 percent of the countys housing stock wiped out and many Paradise residents facing the grinding process of insurance claims, its simply unclear whether those who want to stay close to home while they sort things out will even be able to. Numerous businesses were also lost to the flames, meaning many are also jobless. Those competing pressures are enough that some are already considering leaving for good. The local area wont have enough rentals and jobs to absorb those displaced, said Aradia, who lost the home she was living in with her father. With her place of employment also wiped out and her father close to retirement, theyre planning to leave to be closer to family in Oregon. Insurance could help some like Vesely, whose policy could help fund his trailer plan. But moving forward, insurance rates will remember the blaze. California requires insurers to cover policyholders while theyre rebuilding and at least one renewal, but after that, rates could spike. And while California has a program called the FAIR plan that insures high-risk individuals, those policies come with high premiums some may not be able to afford. That opens the door to the prospect of speculators coming in and buying up property, turning Paradise into something it wasnt. It does have this very small town feel to it, Emily Teague, Gamettes daughter who grew up in Paradise, told Earther. A lot of people are worried developers will come in and make it ritzier. Theres also the uncomfortable question about whether Paradise even should be rebuilt at all. Like the coasts, the wildland-urban interface is becoming a risky place to live in our warming world. Make no mistake: The thousands of people who are homeless because of the Camp Fire are climate refugees. And with forests set to become more flammable, there could be more like them if we dont take a hard look at how we choose to live. Its not like Paradise was unprepared. It created the Paradise Ridge Fire Safe Council in the wake the 2008 Humboldt Fire that destroyed 74 homes in town in an effort to prepare for the big one. The town had evacuations zones. When residents saw the Camp Fire was headed for town, many quickly cleared the ubiquitous pine needles from their roofs before dousing them with water and fleeing for their lives. None of it mattered. And no amount of preparation will necessarily be enough to protect whatever becomes of Paradise in an era where fire season is year round long and major conflagrations are the new normal. The residents in Paradise will have to confront the same thorny questions as their brethren in Mexico Beach, which was rocked by Hurricane Michael earlier this year. Frankly, there are no easy answers.","Everyone who fled the Camp Fire has a story about when they knew things were going to be very, very bad on that fateful Thursday that the flames tore through the town of Paradise and the surrounding region.

"Joshua Berlinger and Matt Rivers, CNN","Beijing (CNN) Fire appears to have engulfed the gilded roof of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest temple, though details on the extent of the damage are scarce even two days later. Chinese state-controlled media confirmed a blaze broke out Saturday at the Jokhang Temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa, and reported that it was quickly brought under control. No injuries were reported. Authorities appear to be censoring mentions of the fire online and suppressing any details of the cause or aftermath. Some social media posts on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform like Twitter, appear to have been erased by government censors. The ability to re-post and comment on other posts was disabled by Monday afternoon after working earlier in the day. The status of Tibet is one of China's most sensitive politics topics. Travel to the region is heavily restricted and news about the region is often censored. Jokhang Temple is widely considered to be one of the most sacred and important sites in Tibet. Buddhist pilgrims prostrate themselves in front of the temple every day, as they have since it was first built in the 7th century. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of videos being shared online showing the fire, and could not reach authorities for comment due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Chinese state media Xinhua said the bustling Barkhor market which surrounds the temple was reopened Sunday. The temple was also open Sunday but will be closed for the next few days as monks celebrate the New Year holiday, Xinhua reported. China's state-controlled Tibet Daily News confirmed there had been a fire but it has since been put out. No one was hurt and the surrounding area is now ""back to normal,"" according to the paper. A hallowed site under a watchful eye Jokhang is one of China's most heavily-secured sites. The square outside the temple has seen a number of anti-China demonstrations by Buddhist monks over the years, protesting what they say are consistent attempts by the Chinese government to suppress Tibetan culture and religious freedom. The temple itself is constructed mainly of wood. It's age, primary building materials, constant burning of incense inside and the fact that the interiors are small and cramped, would make firefighting difficult. A CNN team that visited the temple in 2016 saw little firefighting equipment. Tibet was nominally independent following the collapse of the Qing dynasty, but was incorporated into the People's Republic of China in 1951, after the communist party won the country's civil war, to the chagrin of many in the Tibetan Buddhist community. After a failed revolt against Chinese rule in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama -- Tibet's spiritual leader -- fled to India. The Dalai Lama's former home, the Potala Palace, is located just a few kilometers away from Jokhang Temple. Simmering defiance from Tibetans sometimes boils over into large-scale riots. Activists say more than 140 people have lit themselves on fire in protest of Beijing's rule since 2009. China requires all foreign tourists to have permits and sometimes shuts down access for weeks at a time. It only rarely allows reporters to visit the region. CNN has been permitted to visit twice since 2006. However, China has been grooming the region for a boom in tourism. New villages have been built and a second rail line, connecting Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to Lhasa has been. China already has a 1,956 kilometer railway line between Qinghai and Tibet. Many Tibetans feel that the increase in visitors and the influx of Han Chinese, China's dominant ethnic group, has put their native culture and religion under siege from a government that sees religion as an existential threat to their leadership.

Brian Heater,"Late last week, on lookers captured video and images of a Kiwi delivery robot moments after catching fire on the U.C. Berkeley campus. The startup has been piloting the robots on the University campus for around two years now (we profiled them back in May ), largely without incident, but this is no doubt not how it wanted to gain national recognition. Kiwi confirmed the incident in a blog post Saturday, working to minimize negative PR, noting that challenges have impacted less than 0.6% of our robot fleet. The challenge in this case apparently stemmed from the pint-sized delivery robots battery, which wasnt replaced in time. [Caution: dirty words above.] The battery ignited with some smoke and minor flames, causing a student to grab a nearby fire extinguisher before the Berkeley Fire Department arrived to make sure that it wouldnt reignite. Kiwi says it pulled all robots out of service as it investigated the issue, switching to hand delivery for food. We learned that the root cause was human error when replacing the batteries, where a defective battery was put in place of a functioning one, the company writes. This caused an exceedingly rare occurrence of the battery experiencing thermal runaway. Kiwi adds that its putting a new battery review process in place to help avoid similar incidents in the future.","Late last week, on lookers captured video and images of a Kiwi delivery robot moments after catching fire on the U.C.

Michelle Woo,"Half of house fires happen between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., a time in which most of us would not be conscious enough to know somethings going on. This is terrifying, but theres an easy thing you can do to help you survive: Close your bedroom door before you go to bed. This message comes from the UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI), which found over a decade of research that the simple act could have a potentially life-saving impact. The more oxygen a fire has, the faster it spreads, so a closed door can offer protection. (Also, if you ever must exit a fire, close the door behind you to slow down its growth.) Between a room with an open door and one with a closed door, there can be a 900-degree difference. Watch how a fire impacts these two bedrooms, which are located side by side, adjacent to a burning living room. These days, house fires are more dangerous than ever, as the synthetic materials we use allow fire to spread more quickly than it did in previous generations. (Thirty years ago, you would have had about 17 minutes to escape. Now you have just three minutes.) In addition to having everyone in your family to close their doors before going to sleep, make sure you have working smoke alarms, review your evacuation plan and check for common household fire hazards. These simple precautions may make all the difference.","Half of house fires happen between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., a time in which most of us would not be conscious enough to know something’s going on.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Raymond Wong,"If an Amazon Fire TV 4K and an Echo mated, the new Fire TV Cube would be its baby. The $119.99 cube-shaped device is part Fire TV set-top box, part Echo, and 100 percent awesome for controlling your entertainment system with Alexa voice commands. This is the the TV future we've all been waiting for. SEE ALSO: Amazon Alexa will begin suggesting skills for random requests To be clear, there are already several ways to use Alexa commands to control your Fire TV and entertainment setup, but none are as convenient and easy to set up as the Fire TV Cube. If you own a Fire TV, you can use its Alexa Remote for voice commands, but you still need to press and hold the microphone button. Alternatively, you can connect an Amazon Echo to your Fire TV for true hands-free voice controls, but good luck figuring out how to get your cable box or sound bar working with them. The Fire TV Cube simplifies all of these cumbersome steps with an all-in-one device that just works with Alexa voice commands. Don't worry, there's a mute button on the top. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Right off the bat, it's immediately apparent the Fire TV Cube is an Amazon product. The plain black cube is small and unassuming when placed on top of a media center next to a flatscreen. All four sides of the glossy plastic box are ""IR transparent"" with an IR blaster inside that's capable of controlling any compatible devices. The only giveaways that the box is more than meets the eye is a thin LED strip on the front that lights up blue when you say the ""Alexa"" wake word, the familiar Echo control buttons (volume, mute, and a push-to-activate-Alexa button), and the eight far-field microphone holes located on the top. On the back, you've got a couple of ports. A Micro USB port, an IR port, HDMI, and power. Inside, there's 1.5GHz quad-core processor and 16GB of storage (double the regular 8GB Fire TV 4K). The Fire TV Cube also supports Dolby Atmos audio. And, don't you worry, there's still an Alexa Remote included in the box. TV is better with Alexa The LED light will glow when Alexa is called upon. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Of course, the box is less important than the TV experience, and man, does it look good. After giving me a brief intro on the Fire TV Cube and the challenges Amazon wanted to solve (namely, the complicated setup for adding Alexa to your TV and easier content discovery), Sandeep Gupta, vice president of product development for Amazon Fire TV, wasted no time with a demo. ""Alexa, I'm home,"" Gupta said to the Fire TV Cube. With just that one voice command, the smart lights illuminated, the TV turned on, and the sound bar was ready to go. ""We use [HDMI] CEC to turn on the TV, IR to turn on my sound bar, and an Alexa skill to turn on the lights,"" said Gupta. ""So all of that coming together, orchestrated by the Fire TV Cube. So it uses every simple easy way to come home and turn on the lights and start watching TV."" He then continued to ask Alexa to find him a drama, add Suits to his watch list, scroll the menus, download Crossy Road, switch TV inputs, and more. I had a go, and though I didn't show it in front of Gupta, I was absolutely floored inside. The Fire TV Cube is exactly the kind of hands-free TV viewing experience we've all been waiting for. No more remote controls — just tell your TV what you want and it does it all for you. The Fire TV's interface has been tweaked to be more friendly for voice navigation. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Amazon has tweaked the Fire TV interface specifically for far-field voice controls. It's a familiar tile-based UI, but one with multiple ways to access your content. For example, to select shows and apps, you can either call them by their title name or the number labeled next to them. ""It borrows a lot from what we do on the Echo Show with a nice grid layout that's easy to navigate — obviously expanded because you can do more with this bigger [TV] canvas,"" said Gupta. At launch, only some apps, such as PlayStation Vue, will have full-blown voice controls, but the plan is for all apps to eventually work with Alexa commands only. One of those apps is Netflix, which is a huge win for Amazon. Gupta told me the streaming video service will have full Alexa voice control support when the Fire Cube TV is released later this month. Apps without Alexa voice controls will default to the Alexa Remote for controls, which kinda sucks. Hopefully that's just temporary and apps will get updated quickly. All the contents, even from your cable box The Fire TV Cube controls your cable box with IR. Image: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE Fire TV Cube users will have access to all of the content already available from Fire TV, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Channels, etc. Apps like PlayStation Vue and Hulu that have live content also work with voice controls, so you can say something like ""Alexa, tune into CNN on PlayStation Vue,"" and then continue to switch between channels within the app. The Fire TV Cube also works with your cable box, because you know, not everyone has cut the cord. Gupta showed me how this worked and it's practically black magic. ""Alexa, tune into CNN on cable,"" Gupta said to the Fire TV Cube. The Fire TV Cube automatically changed the input on the TV to the cable box and then IR-blasted the CNN channel number to the cable box. All of this happens invisibly and in a split second so that you don't even notice the digital handshake between the Fire TV Cube, TV, and cable box. ""It's kind of effortless and the goal here is to reach the devices that our customers already have and not have to redefine how to do things,"" said Gupta. ""When you set up your device, you tell us your cable company, your location, and we do the rest for you. We get your channel lineup, we put it in the cloud, we voice enable it so we take care of it for you. Users don't need to do anything to set up IR; it's done with this device."" If you love the Fire TV and Echo, it's hard not to not love the Fire TV Cube. Image: amazon Fire TV Cube users will also notice many Alexa skills will have visual information — the same kind you'll find on the Echo Show. For instance, if you ask Alexa for the weather, it'll show the forecast on your TV. Or if you ask for a news flash briefing, it'll show a video clip along with it. Or if you play Jeopardy, you'll actually be able to see answer on the TV, while the Fire Cube TV listens for voice answers. One particular feature I liked was for Amazon Music. If you're playing a song, you can ask Alexa to show lyrics on the screen and they'll scroll while the song plays. It's like your own karaoke setup. Alexa, can you hear me? Naturally, you're probably wondering how well an Echo speaker can pick up your voice if it's next to a sound bar or TV speaker that's playing pretty loud. Gupta says they've arranged the far-field microphones inside of the Fire TV Cube vertically instead of horizontally so it's not a problem. And sure enough, in my demo, the Fire TV Cube was still able to hear my voice clearly, even next to a sound bar. And if you have another Echo already installed in the same room as the Fire TV Cube, Gupta says the bias will be towards the Fire TV Cube. Amazon believes this is what the user will expect and want, but they'll be collecting user feedback to see if it matches with intent once the product's released. RIP remote controls Amazon's Fire TV Cube looks to be the gadget to rule our entertainment setup. It might actually inch us closer to never needing a remote control ever again. And to that, I say good riddance. How many times have you lost your TV remote? Who can even look at a cable remote and not vomit from the million buttons? Voice controls are the future, and Amazon's leading the charge with the Fire TV Cube. The Fire TV Cube will be available on June 21 for $119.99. And for a limited time this week, Prime members will be able to pick it up for a discounted $89.99.","If an Amazon Fire TV 4K and an Echo mated, the new Fire TV Cube would be its baby.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"In a follow-up interview, Mr. Sanchez said his family was still mapping out what comes next; his first steps included getting an identification card and securing a temporary place to live for himself and his two boys.

It’s tragic that tragedy brings us closer together, but out of that we learn to depend on each other and work together,” he said. President Trump on Saturday approved a disaster declaration for California, which will make federal assistance available for Shasta County residents affected by the Carr Fire.

Daniel Kolitz,"Let’s say your house is on fire, or overrun by a gang of psychotic raccoons. You don’t hesitate—you take out your phone, and you call the fire department, or animal control, and then firemen/raccoon-wranglers are promptly dispatched to your home. These are well-established protocols, essential to the maintenance of a mostly not-on-fire, feral-animal-free society. But what about UFOs? What about extraterrestrial beings? Faced with some six-eyed slime-being rooting through your trash, or a spacecraft idling above your backyard (provided it’s not Elon Musk’s “nuclear alien UFO” again), who exactly would you think to call? And what would whoever you called do, when you called them? These questions—suddenly pressing, what with the recent revelation that the Pentagon had spent $22 million between 2008 and 2012 to investigate mysterious, potentially alien-related phenomena—form the basis of this week’s Giz Asks. We reached out to dozens of agencies, everyone from NASA to the Center for Disease Control to the NYPD to find out who to call in such a situation, and what (if any) protocols are in place when these things are reported, and we came up mostly empty-handed—though the astronomers and independent institutes we spoke with did provide us with some hope. The US government might, at present, be grievously ill-prepared for first contact, but there are countless hobbyists and professionals keeping an eye on what’s happening up there. Seth Shostak Senior Astronomer, SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) Institute We [at SETI] are looking for life in space, but we don’t think that they’re here. If they were, you’d have trouble flying out of Newark airport. When people call to report something they’ve seen, that call usually goes to me. Probably once a day I talk to somebody who’s seen something, and I explain to them that we don’t take such reports, but that if they want to send me photos or videos I’m happy to look at them. But, you know: They’ve seen something in the sky, they don’t understand what it is, and of course then they jump to the conclusion that what they’ve seen are alien visitors. The usual excuse is: “Well, the government has all the good information covered up somewhere.” That’s something that doesn’t comport with my experience working with the government, nor does it make sense. I mean: “Ah, the aliens arranged things so that only the government could see them.” It doesn’t make any sense. Most of [what people send me] are aircrafts, or balloons—there’s just a whole laundry list. If they send me photos or videos, they’re almost always taken at night—you can’t really tell what you’re looking at. And usually they’re using their phones, or some simple camera that has autofocus. As a consequence, because it’s night, and it’s only a light in the middle of the phone [screen], the camera’s autofocus mechanism starts hunting—it sort of zooms in and out on the focus and as a consequence the light seems to get bigger or smaller. When it’s big, you see all these diffraction effects on the image, which people send me elaborate descriptions of—you know, “here are the markings on the craft, I think I can decode them,” that sort of thing. We don’t tell them, oh, well, you’re wrong—I don’t know if they’re wrong or not. All I can say is the evidence has not been good enough. I can’t say that I’ve ever seen anything where I’ve thought: omigosh, these are aliens. We think that the aliens are definitely out there, but on planets around other stars, not in the skies over Trenton. So I usually tell them that they can look up MUFON—which is an acronym for Mutual UFO Network—which does reports, although there are tens of thousands of reports every year, so they probably can’t handle all of them. Deputy Chief Timothy J. Trainor The CO of the Public Information Division, New York Police Department The NYPD is responsible to keep 8.5 million residents and commuters safe every day. This now includes the very real threat of a terrorist attack on innocent people who live and work in this great city. I am recommending that the “journalists” who write for Gizmodo shift their focus to featuring to their readers how the men and women of the NYPD work tirelessly to keep New Yorkers safe. To even suggest that the NYPD engage in such frivolous and meaningless drivel is insulting. Bertram Kelly Public Affairs Team Lead, Centers for Disease Control UFOs are not in the scope of research work performed by the CDC. We suggest you reach out to NASA for any information regarding UFOs. Dwayne Brown NASA spokesperson We normally send folks to DOD. While we do not know yet if we are alone in the universe, NASA has missions moving forward that may help answer that fundamental question. Catharine “Cassie” Conley Former Planetary Protection Officer, currently a researcher at NASA That would depend if it’s a big alien or a little alien. If it’s an intelligent alien, that’s actually the probably of the Air Force, other militaries and probably the UN. If it’s a tiny alien, you wouldn’t know you ran into it. Daryl Mayer 88th Air Base Wing Public Affairs To be honest, we don’t have any guidance here about such an event. You might be able to get more from the Pentagon Press Desk, but I’m not sure. Bruce Betts Director of Science and Technology, The Planetary Society If you find an alien, who do you call? There are several cases to consider: 1. You detect what you think might be an intelligent alien signal coming from space. You are probably a SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) scientist. As such, the first thing you do is try to verify the signal by doing more observations and you “call” other SETI observers to try to get them to observe the same part of the sky at the same wavelength of light. No SETI scientist is going to believe a single signal is ET rather than some spurious effect from the equipment or the surroundings. Multiple signals from the same place in the sky observed by different observatories will be required, as well as careful verification that it is not some other natural signal. Once verification has occurred, you “call” everyone, announcing publicly the signal as well as all details associated with it so others can study and verify it. 2. You detect evidence of past or present life, probably microbial, elsewhere in our solar system, e.g., on Mars, or in the subsurface oceans of Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus. You are probably an astrobiologist working with spacecraft data from one of the world’s space agencies. The first step is verifying your finding and publishing (as well as publicly announcing) your results so others can verify or otherwise assess your finding. So, figuratively call other scientists. There is obviously a theme here of being careful with a finding this significant. As Carl Sagan said, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” 3. You find an alien yourself, in person, like in the movie E.T. or other movies where it didn’t work out as well. In this case of alien emergency, hang up and dial 911, and hope they believe you. And, personally, I’d call your dog. Dogs are probably good judges of alien intent. What is the protocol? Is there any? For the same 3 cases: 1. There is not a binding protocol, but most SETI scientists have agreed to one set out by the International Academy of Astronautics. Included are policies of public openness and transparency, verification/confirmation, and the principle of not sending any message back without agreement from an international body such as the United Nations. 2. For spacecraft exploration, there are protocols regarding planetary protection: protecting the Earth from danger, unlikely as it may be, from the discovered life, and protecting the environment where life might be discovered from confusion caused by contamination from Earth life. Among these planetary protection guidelines is the international planetary protection policy from COSPAR (Committee on Space Research). 3. To my knowledge, there is no protocol for who to call if you find an alien on Earth. Once again, I suggest consulting with your dog. Andrew Semion Director of the Berkeley Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence center When astronomers see something that they think is interesting, they notify other astronomers. (These aren’t necessarily professional astronomers—they could very well be amateur astronomers, using small telescopes in their backyards.) There’s a mechanism in astronomy for sharing this kind of information, called the Astronomer’s Telegram. For example, when our group, back in late August, detected fifteen bursts from the repeating FRB [Fast Radio Burst] source, FRB 121102, we wrote a short Astronomer’s Telegram and released it to all of our colleagues to encourage follow-up—at other wavelengths and with other radio telescopes—to see if we could detect additional bursts. One other example, also very timely, is what happened with ‘Oumuamua, the first interstellar asteroid. This object was detected by the PanSTARRS 1 [telescope], and they released a minor planet bulletin, which is similar to an Astronomer’s Telegram, but a special version for asteroids. They encouraged additional follow-up of the object, and of course that additional follow-up eventually determined that the object was indeed interstellar, and that it was likely an asteroid rather than a comet. And in fact it encouraged our group in Berkeley to actually follow it up from the perspective of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The continued observations of Tabby’s Star, the so-called megastructure star, is another great example of this. Here’s a situation in which members of the public, participating in a citizen’s science program, discovered something in archival data—they saw a signal coming from a particular star that they didn’t; understand. Astronomers who were involved in that project got involved, and that ultimately triggered a huge amount of follow-up observation all over the world, culminating just in the last couple of months with the determination that there’s what’s called a wavelength dependence to the dimming of that star, which means that it bends more at short wavelengths than it does at long wavelengths, and that’s been interpreted—rightfully so, I think—to indicate that the likely cause of that dimming is interstellar dust, or perhaps circumstellar dust, dust that’s just orbiting around the star. We absolutely do have mechanisms in place to respond to things that are discovered, and most of the time discoveries are made by professional observatories, but sometimes the public is involved and the Tabby’s Star thing is a good example of that. Avi Loeb Chair of the Astronomy Department at Harvard There is currently no procedure decided by the community, including the government, as to what needs to be done in case of the detection of signals from some extraterrestrial civilization. UFOs were and are reported routinely, but there has been no credible evidence in the past for anything significant, so these are usually dismissed. There is currently no procedure, no protocol, as to how to approach it.What would happen, presumably, is it would very quickly leak to the news media, or the public. It would not be kept secret. The question is how to react, and what consequences of such a discovery would be. That depends on whether this thing is detected coming from far away—the signal is originating far away—or is it here on earth, nearby. If it’s far away, then there is no urgency and one can decide whether to respond at all—there are people who think that we take a risk if we reveal our existence. If it’s something very nearby, then of course it needs to reach political levels as well as to what to do. But as of now there are no formal protocols as to how to respond, and part of that is because most people do not regard that as a likely situation. Usually, once there is an incident of some sort, people develop a policy about it. But it’s sort of under the radar [right now], and people are not really thinking about it. It would be a good idea to develop a strategy, just to have it in the books, but even then the question is whether people will obey [the protocol], because if it’s an amateur that detects the signal they may not follow it.

Sarah Perez,"Amazon’s Fire TV is getting an update that will help viewers better discover live TV programming, and even be able to tune into live channels with Alexa. The voice integration builds on the recently added “On Now” row on the Fire TV homepage, where you’ll find the live streams from channels like HBO, Showtime, Starz and Cinemax, if you’re signed up through Amazon Channels. This row will display what’s currently airing on those channels, so you can tune in to the current program with either your remote, or now, your voice. To access the channel you want, you can just tell Alexa to “watch HBO,” “go to Showtime,” or “tune to Cinemax,” for example, by pressing the Alexa button on the Fire TV remote. In addition, Fire TV is rolling out a new Channel Guide that lets you browse the channels’ full lineup, starting with what’s on right now and going out two weeks. You can access this guide via the remote, as well, by pressing the Options button, or asking Alexa to “go to the Channel Guide.” Plus, the “Recent” row now captures the last “Live” channel and video on demand titles viewed, Amazon says, which makes it easier to get to your favorite content. A preview of the live channel is also presented while customers browse. The new features make Fire TV feel more like the front-end to a live TV service – an interesting change, given that Amazon reportedly cancelled its plans to launch its own “skinny bundle” of programming to rival services like Sling TV, Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, and others. Instead, it’s been focusing on building out its a la carte service for Prime members, Amazon Channels. The company previously worked with select channels, including Netflix and HBO, to better integrate their content into Fire TV’s main interface by way of partner rows. These rows – which are not sold to channels for a fee – have included personalized recommendations pulled in from the streaming services themselves. This new Live TV experience arriving now to Fire TV is only available with this handful of premium subscriptions offered through Amazon Channels for the time being, the company says. Obviously, it doesn’t make sense for other services like Netflix – which is on-demand only, and not a TV channel with live programming. However, Amazon says it plans to bring more channels to the Live TV service in the near future, which could effectively turn the Fire TV into a live TV-like service, without forcing users to buy a skinny bundle of content they don’t want.","Amazon’s Fire TV is getting an update that will help viewers better discover live TV programming, and even be able to tune into live channels with Alexa.

Cameron Faulkner,"Which Amazon Fire TV device is right for you? That depends on what sort of features you want to have access to, as well as how much cash you’re willing to spend. Each of the company’s three set-top boxes plug into your television’s HDMI port and provide instant access to the expected suite of popular apps and subscription services, from Prime Video to Netflix, Hulu, and the like. Beyond these similarities, though, they vary in fairly subtle ways that may matter to you, especially if you just bought a new 4K television. If you’re considering Amazon’s set-top boxes primarily because you are an Amazon Prime subscriber, there are only a few other options that work with Prime Video on the big screen. You could check out the new Toshiba LED television that comes with Fire TV built-in. Otherwise, the short list of devices that natively support the app includes the Apple TV, the fleet of Roku devices, Sony Android TVs, and the Nvidia Shield, though Echo compatibility and Alexa support is exclusive to Amazon devices and the aforementioned Toshiba TV. Amazon Fire TV Stick The $39 Amazon Fire TV Stick sits at the bottom shelf in terms of its low price and comparatively limited feature set. Nevertheless, this is a competent option for those who just want in at the base level without spending too much cash. The Fire TV Stick tops out at 1080p resolution for streaming, and navigating the interface is made easy with the remote that is included with purchase. Fortunately, if you’d rather not fuss with the directional pad and the bevy of buttons, the remote also supports dictation, so you can search for content with your voice. If you own an Amazon Echo or have Alexa set up as a voice assistant on your smartphone, Amazon makes it simple to link up your devices to enable hands-free use. Instead of looking around for remotes, you can simply give Alexa a shout to launch a game, TV show, or movie. Buy it here: Amazon Fire TV Stick Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Amazon Fire TV with 4K At nearly double the cost of the Fire TV Stick, the Fire TV with 4K ’s main attraction is, as you might have expected, its ability to stream content in 4K HDR — should your TV and internet bandwidth support it. Video quality aside, almost nothing is different here compared to the cheaper model. Its design is slightly more obtuse, though it may be a more favorable option for those with ambitions of mounting their TVs, but are hindered by rear-facing HDMI ports that don’t allow for the clearance that the Fire TV Stick demands. Finding enough 4K HDR content to make the jump up in price worth it isn’t the concern it used to be, with much of Amazon’s original Prime programming and “thousands” of other titles being offered in 4K HDR, according to Amazon. Like the Fire TV Stick, the $69 Fire TV with 4K comes with the Alexa-enabled remote, and it offers the same cross-device functionality via your Amazon Echo just by shouting a command. Buy it here: Amazon Fire TV with 4K Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge Amazon Fire TV Cube At $119, the Fire TV Cube is currently Amazon’s most costly set-top box, though for good reason, it seems. It packs in the 4K HDR capability of the $69 model, then builds on it with features that you won’t find in Amazon’s other set-top devices — or ones made by other companies, for that matter. The Fire TV Cube is made for hands-free use, negating the need for an Amazon Echo to help you get situated with the next episode or a flick. Out of the box, Amazon’s costliest set-top option supports loads of voice commands, but it comes with a remote control for the moments when manual navigating is easier or just plain necessary. Also included is the ability to control other devices, making the Fire TV Cube into a universal remote, of sorts, capable of powering on and off your A/V equipment. Amazon lets you name the devices living in your entertainment center, so all it takes is a voice command to Alexa to start things up. There’s an important (and somewhat strange) distinction between the Fire TV Cube and the rest of Amazon’s Fire TV devices: your voice can turn off your equipment here while the others cannot. Turning on each of your devices is only half of the battle, so if you want an option that can let you stay horizontal on the couch, the Fire TV Cube might be worth looking into. Beyond just controlling your home entertainment gear, the Fire TV Cube can also control other smart home products that are Alexa-compatible. This device’s lean into Internet of Things territory could be overkill for some, but its native Echo-like skills and 4K HDR support make it an unbeatable value if you’re keen to stay in the realm of all things Amazon.

Alex Weinberg,"On January 19th, 2017, the Plasco building, a 17-story steel high-rise in Tehran, caught fire. The blaze began on one of the building’s upper floors and then spread quickly through the tower’s sprinkler-less garment workshops. As the Tehran fire department battled the nearly unreachable fire, the steel skyscraper collapsed in full view of Iranian state television cameras. Sixteen firefighters and at least six civilians were found dead in the smoldering debris. Tens of thousands of citizens publicly mourned the firefighters when they were laid to rest in the “martyrs” section of the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in Tehran. In addition to the human toll, Tehran also lost a landmark building, the first steel framed high-rise to be erected in the city in the 1960s. Since the Plasco building collapse occurred one day before the Trump inauguration, most Americans were too busy preparing for our own national calamity to pay attention to the disaster in Iran. However, one group of ideologically invested Americans responded immediately: Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth (AE911Truth), a organization which promotes the conspiracy theory about a “controlled demolition” that brought down the World Trade Center skyscrapers and a subsequent “cover-up.” The Plasco building collapse. AE911Truth, probably most starched and ironed of all the 9/11 conspiracy groups, was formed in 2006 as a place for building experts to advocate for a reinvestigation of the World Trade Center attacks. AE911Truth has spent the past decade convincing a brain trust of YouTube commenters that tall buildings simply cannot collapse due to fire. But rather than accepting the Plasco Building as a thundering rebuttal to their theories, AE911Truth concluded that Plasco was also a controlled demolition. Before the dust had even settled in Tehran, AE911Truth issued a press release urging President Hassan Rouhani to investigate the “possible use of explosives” in the destruction of the tower. The organization, which is now a 501(c)(3) non-profit, stands out from the throng of 9/11 conspiracy organizations due to its roster of members who have letters after their names and who possess at least a passing knowledge of engineering lingo. The founder, president, and one of the few full-time employees is Richard Gage, a wide-tied former architect who demonstrates his understanding of structural mechanics using cardboard boxes. (My attempts to contact Richard Gage or representatives of AE911Truth were either ignored or rejected, but they did wish us “best of luck with your faux journalism hit piece.”) AE911Truth also differentiates itself by rejecting the kookiest 9/11 theories: That no planes were used in the attacks, that there were nuclear devices hidden in the WTC basement, and that the towers themselves were completely empty stage props or holograms. (Israel figures heavily in all of these scenarios.) Instead it argues that unnamed nefarious entities demolished the towers with well-hidden pre-planted explosives. To explain away the absence of audio or visual evidence of typical demolition charges, AE911Truth argues that the buildings were brought down by nano-thermite, a material with a highly exothermic reaction which hardly exists outside of advanced physics journals. Nano-thermite, the phlogiston of the conspiracy narrative, would have silently severed critical structural members and triggered a progressive collapse. In his role as head of AE911Truth, Richard Gage travels to conferences around the world (both alternative and mainstream) and lectures audiences on the finer points of the controlled demolition theory. AE911Truth has conspicuously focused on the collapse of World Trade Center Tower 7, a 47-story building which caught fire after the destruction of WTC1 and then collapsed about seven hours later. This building has long been the truther’s ace in the hole because its collapse—which claimed zero lives—was hardy notable among the other atrocities of the day. Since the average joe has little or no knowledge about the existence of WTC7 and no preconceived notions about its demise, the conspiracy theorist can lay out their controlled demolition story nearly unrebutted. In addition, no plane ever hit the building, so the cause of its catastrophic structural damage is not immediately apparent, especially when compared to WTC1 and WTC2. (The consensus opinion on WTC7 is that uncontrolled fires eventually weakened steel members where the structure spanned over a pre-existing electrical substation. This led to a series of internal failures within the eastern side of the building which progressed into a global structural collapse.) The conspiracy theory presented by Gage and AE911Truth is based on three core axioms: 1) Steel skyscrapers cannot collapse due to fire, 2) buildings that collapse should tumble down slowly (rather than at what they call “free-fall speed”), and 3) a collapsing building should topple over eccentrically rather than falling straight down. These arguments may not make any sense when examined closely, but they are persuasive bumper sticker statements, and rebutting the claims requires a level of engineering knowledge that the average person may lack. Prior to Plasco, it was difficult to produce counterexamples that would immediately disprove these truther axioms because out-of-control high-rise fires just don’t happen very often. Small fires occur as frequently in skyscrapers as they do in any other type of building, but they rarely flash over into all-consuming infernos. There are obvious risks in stacking human beings up in columns hundreds of feet in the air, so architects and engineers make special considerations for protecting tall buildings from from fire. Passive protection systems, such as firestops at floor penetrations and fire-rated doors at stairwells, are designed to compartmentalize blazes and prevent them from spreading. Active protection systems like sprinklers go one step further and suppress fire once heat and smoke are detected. Disasters like the Grenfell Tower Fire in London demonstrate the appalling consequences of neglecting these key safety considerations. When major skyscraper blazes have occurred, 9/11 truthers have cited the charred but standing structural skeletons as proof of their narrative. Fires scorched Beijing’s 34-story Television Cultural Center in 2009 as well as Dubai’s 67-story Torch in 2012 and 63-story Address in 2015, but none of these buildings collapsed. Conspiracy theorists loudly declared these incidents to be proof that fire alone cannot take down a skyscraper. However, the critical characteristic that AE911Truth ignores is that both towers in Dubai were concrete buildings, and Beijing’s TVCC Building was a composite structure. The aforementioned Grenfell Tower was also a concrete structure. Pawel Woelke, PhD, P.E., an engineer and expert in structural failure, notes, “Concrete is a material that doesn’t really soften nearly as easily due to high temperature, mostly because it’s porous. It’s a much more porous material, the void/volume fraction is massive compared to steel.” Concrete is somewhere between 20 and 40 times less thermally conductive than steel, and concrete structural systems also tend to be more massive than steel structures, meaning that much more energy is needed to heat them to the same degree. Concrete and steel are both materials used in the superstructures of skyscrapers, but they behave very differently under prolonged exposure to fire. This knowledge seems to be lost on AE911Truth, which has trumpeted every concrete high-rise blaze as definitive proof that fire simply cannot cause a steel building to collapse. But fire’s deleterious effect on steel is a well-known phenomenon and has been studied by engineers since at least the 1870s. Woelke comments, “At 450 degrees [Celsius] or so, you get basically a 50 percent drop in strength and stiffness, and that’s very significant.” Prolonged exposure to heat from well-ventilated home or office fires (which can reach 1100 degrees Celsius) can decrease steel’s yield strength and modulus of elasticity more than enough to cause the structure to fail. Heat also causes steel to expand, which means that beams, girders, and braces push outward on already weakened structural connections. Old school builders used terra cotta or brick to insulate structural steel members from heat, but engineers today opt for concrete, cementitious spray-on coatings, or intumescent paint. But the goal of fireproofing is not to ensure that the building will survive an hours-long inferno. Instead, as Woelke says, “The primary objective is to allow evacuation of the building, to increase the amount of time that the occupants have to exit the building. There is no assumption that a building that is allowed to burn for hours and hours is going to be totally fine.” A well-designed building is one that grants occupants enough time to evacuate before the steel is weakened to the point of failure. The Plasco Building stood for hours after catching fire, allowing scores of merchants to evacuate to safety. When the flames finally overwhelmed the steel structure, it fell quickly and vertically, in direct contradiction to the core beliefs of Architects and Engineers for 911 Truth. In spite of the similarities between the demise of the Plasco Building and WTC7, AE911Truth had gone full “When Prophecy Fails” by committing itself even further to its conspiracy narrative. One month after the fire, AE911Truth released a paper confirming its own unsolicited suggestion that the Plasco building was demolished with pre-planted explosives. Most of the links in footnotes of the paper point to YouTube videos and th organization’s own PDF documents. As proof of its claims, it cites puffs of smoke emanating from the collapsing building (demolition squibs), large clouds of dust and ash (proof of highly energetic explosive material), and the presence of supposedly molten material in the debris pile (nano-thermite’s persistent exothermic reaction). Since truthers made these exact same observations about WTC7, and since WTC7 must have been a controlled demolition, then clearly the Plasco Building was demolished as well. In a perfect infinite loop of anti-logic—like a snake slithering into its own asshole—an exact refutation of AE911Truth’s beliefs has instead vindicated them completely. The debates over Plasco’s collapse have raged in the same hundred page forum threads and YouTube comment sections as the 9/11 arguments of yesteryear. Tony Szamboti, a mechanical engineer, JFK assassination conspiracy theorist, and longtime AE911Truth foot soldier, has been the most prominent truther in the trenches, battling giddy debunkers on the International Skeptics Forum (a science-centered discussion board that grew out of the James Randi Educational Forum, which often focuses on debunking hoaxes, conspiracies, and popular myths) and attempting to salvage the time he invested in a battered ideology. On February 23, Szamboti appeared on a podcast called “9/11 Free Fall,” and pushed back against the Plasco narrative, saying “There was a number of people who were trying to say ‘Look, a building can collapse by fire!’ Well, not so fast. Certainly looks like there were explosions in the building.” Szamboti may have convinced himself that Plasco collapsed due to explosions, but he seems to have failed to win over the crowd at International Skeptics Forum ; Szamboti, who had posted there almost 5,000 times since 2008, fled the forums two weeks before his podcast appearance. He did not respond to request for comment on this article. While the broader AE911Truth organization is engaging in a losing battle online, CEO Richard Gage has blithely continued to deliver his conspiracy presentations. In June 2017, he spoke at The Red Pill Expo in Bozeman, Montana, alongside goldbugs, doctors who cure cancer with aromatherapy, and fake British “Lord” Christopher Monckton. Ironically, it is AE911Truth’s own nominal interest in science that necessitates an intense defense of such an untenable position. The conspiracy theorists who blame 9/11 on Israeli directed energy weapons and reptilian seismic shape charges haven’t bothered to react to the Plasco disaster because they don’t have to. Their detachment from reality is so sharp that no real world evidence could ever inform their beliefs. David Dees hasn’t even mentioned the Plasco building. However, for groups like AE911Truth to continue to present themselves as rational, educated experts, they must at least appear to address conflicting evidence whenever and wherever it arises. In April 2017, the investigation led by the government of Iran ignored AE911Truth’s recommendations and declared fire to be the sole cause of Plasco’s collapse. A further parliamentary inquiry pinned the blame of the fire on unauthorized heating devices on the 10th floor, and decried the substandard ventilation, lighting, and fire protection within the doomed building. As the world moves on and a new 10 story structure starts construction at the site of the Plasco collapse, the sentinels of AE911Truth continue their commitment to the conspiracy, scanning the horizon, waiting for the next controlled demolition cover-up.

JIM DWYER,"Nate Johnson, walking his Jack Russell, Lucky, lived one street over then, and now. He remembered the children playing outside, then seeing the firefighters carrying out their bodies, and later, the three big glass jars that had been set up by neighbors and filled with nearly $10,000 in small bills and coins for the survivors by people walking past. In the foyer of 1022, forgetting was not an option. Ms. Magassa digested the news of the Prospect Avenue deaths. The TV beyond her blared with children’s shows. The electronic chirp from the stairs returned every minute. “Anything God does is good,” she said. “I call Allah my God. I lost five children in the fire. I can do nothing to hold them in this world.” Ms. Magassa is one of the wives of Moussa Magassa; polygamy is legal in Mali. The maternal care of the children is shared among the wives. “That day of the fire in 2007, I have, like, seven. I lost five,” Ms. Magassa said. “My little son got born in 2008. So I have three children now.” Investigators determined that the Woodycrest fire was set off on the ground floor by an overheated electrical cord on a space heater near a bed. A woman grabbed a child and ran upstairs to warn others. She left the door open behind her. That, the investigators believed, let the fire travel up the stairs, as if it were a chimney. The circumstances in Thursday’s blaze on Prospect Avenue were similar: a child in a ground floor apartment was playing with a stove and set off the fire, family members ran out of the apartment, leaving the door open behind them. The chimney effect of the stairs did the rest. Of her escape that night in 2007, Ms. Magassa said, “If it was my time, Allah would have taken me. It can be any time. That was not my time. It is not easy to handle, but you have to handle it.” Her faith had allowed her to carry on, she said. The chirping sounded again. Two boys scampered about the living room, indifferent to the adults’ conversation. What would she tell the people on Prospect Avenue? “They have to accept what happens,” she said. Did that take a long time? Her eyes glistened, and she turned her head away before answering. “I didn’t make it hard on myself,” she said. “Allah make that happen.” She was asked about smoke detectors. The fire report said there had been no batteries in them. “That was so long ago, 10 years,” she said. “I don’t remember.” The chirping sounded again from the staircase, the same one that the flames had shot through. That sound came from a smoke detector, warning that its battery was almost dead. “I didn’t know that,” Ms. Magassa said. “I will call my son to bring batteries now.” Continue reading the main story","In 2007, a makeshift memorial was set up outside 1022 Woodycrest in the Bronx where a fire killed 10 people.

Graeme McMillan,"Last week was a busy one. Between the government shutdown and deciding whether or not—in light of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar being sentenced to 175 years in prison for decades of sexual abuse—the internet has a new hero in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, a lot went down. It was also a week that marked the passing of author Ursula Le Guin and the Fall frontman Mark E. Smith. Really, there was a lot going on. In addition to all of that, there was also… this. We Know What President Trump Did Last Summer What Happened: Remember how President Trump said he wasn't looking to fire the special counsel investigating him? Turns out, he tried to do that very thing last year. What Really Happened: Just days after President Trump was saying that he would speak to special council Robert Mueller under oath as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the political establishment was rocked by a story in The New York Times and quickly backed up by the Washington Post that he had actually tried to fire Mueller in June of last year, only stopping when the White House counsel threatened to resign over the matter. (Shades of Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre, as some people noticed.) As the story went wide across the internet, many wondered why this story, which took place last summer, was breaking now. Others believed they had the answer. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the whole kerfuffle, though, is that (as of this writing) Trump has yet to address the matter on Twitter, although he did deny that it was true during a public appearance in Davos, where he was speaking with other world leaders. There’s a slight complication with that denial, however. So, is this the president lying, or is this the result of a disorganized White House that didn’t know to push back on the reports when they first appeared? And where do the multiple confirmations to reporters stand in all of this? The Takeaway: Twitter? Let ‘Em In (In Reduced Numbers, Obviously) What Happened: The White House manages to unite liberals and conservatives by releasing an immigration policy no one likes. What Really Happened: The issue of immigration has always been central to the political landscape, but never moreso than during the tenure of President Trump, who is pro- wall and anti- shitholes. After Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, both shutdown the government and then reopened it again, the White House this week unveiled its own framework for immigration reform. It was … bold. Details of what the White House was offering started to emerge in initial media reports, and, well, it definitely doesn’t seem like the best deal. If it’s such a hardline reform that reduces immigration quite so much, then presumably, Republicans must be into it, right? In other words, expect this one to run and run. Like it has been doing since then-candidate Trump called Mexicans rapists and criminals. The Takeaway: If only there was some kind of lesson to be learned from this whole debacle… The First Rule of Fight Club Is, Text About Fight Club What Happened: When is a technical error not a technical error? When it’s an expression of the secret society, which is called the secret society by those involved, because that’s definitely a thing that actually happens. What Really Happened: The ever-ongoing rightwing conspiracies about a “Deep State” conspiracy against the president got even weirder this week—yes, even weirder than when Eric Trump seemed to suggest that Ellen DeGeneres was part of the Deep State. This time, the new ""proof"" was a technical snafu. This mattered because amongst the missing texts were many exchanged between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, respectively an FBI lawyer and investigator, who were alleged to be at the center of the conspiracy against the president. Turns out, the texts were then recovered, which just caused more outcry, because, Republican lawmakers said, they discussed a secret society, which was proof of the conspiracy! Suffice to say, this got a lot of people very excited. There was one problem: When the text at the center of the whole thing went public, it was pretty clear that it was just a joke. Soon, even those who’d firmly believed that this was a smoking gun were backing away from the idea: And, it turns out, not even everyone on Fox News, which happily spread the rumors earlier in the week, was onboard. Soon enough, the entire idea of the Secret Society became a punchline in and of itself, which is exactly what folks probably wanted. The Takeaway: Wow, it sure is great that there’s not really serious stuff happening in the world that everyone can focus on conspiracy theories and have elected officials make spurious allegations! Amirite? The Best Seat in the House What Happened: Anyone unconvinced by the healing power of art hasn’t heard about the Guggenheim’s amazing ability to offer the ideal piece for every situation. What Really Happened: File this one under: “Undeniably strange, and yet somehow, as implausible as it seems, true."" Yes, a gold toilet. And it gets better. No, really, it gets even better than that. Really, the story at the center of all of this is exactly as good as you think it would be after that initial tease, which might explain why it immediately went viral, because a golden toilet is too perfect for Trump. Twitter, would you like to weigh in? And, of course, the Guggenheim wasn’t the only ones throwing shade over this particular issue. The Takeaway: Of course, there’s almost certainly no way that Donald Trump would overreact to being made such a public laughing stock by the art establishment, right? Right ? Resetting the Doomsday Clock What Happened: Even the experts are feeling too optimistic about how things are going to turn out, it seems. What Really Happened: Turns out, it’s not just you who thinks that we’re headed towards the end of the world right now, and not just in that hot new Netflix show kind of way. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists—a real thing, honestly— moved the Doomsday Clock to two minutes to midnight this week, the closest to apocalypse the world has been since 1953. It’s a chilling moment, and a reminder that, as a species, we need to take a collective breath and work together to step away from the brink of disaster. Some people, however, weren’t really taking the whole thing entirely seriously. The Takeaway: Who knows? Maybe we were overreacting to the whole thing after all.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Many devices are now pulling double-duty these days. Game consoles are entertainment streaming devices. Smartwatches tell you the time while also telling you which of your coworkers is demanding your attention. Lightbulbs are burglar deterrents, at least when they’re not setting the mood. So Onelink’s Safe and Sound, a smoke and carbon monoxide alarm with an integrated speaker and voice assistant, isn’t exactly a far-fetched concept. It is, however, indicative of a future where connected devices aren’t just for nerds. You might not need a voice assistant, smartwatch, or a ceiling-mounted speaker, but everyone needs a smoke alarm. Whether you need a $250 smoke alarm is another. Onelink’s Safe and Sound is a smoke and carbon monoxide alarm with an integrated speaker, Alexa voice assistant (a version supporting Google Assistant is coming soon), and HomeKit compatibility. It’s definitely larger than your average smoke detector, and will stick out at least an extra two inches from your ceiling. That being said, you’ll quickly forget it’s there, noticing it only due to its convenient night light feature. It isn’t the only “smart” smoke alarm, either. There’s the notification-sending Roost smoke alarm battery, as well as the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm. While both are capable of alerting users to fires via smartphone apps, the Nest lacks any voice assistant or music playback support, and had its most interesting gesture-based alarm silencing feature disabled thanks to the risk of silencing the alarm during an actual fire. Onelink Safe &amp; Sound Smoke and CO Alarm What is it? A smoke and carbon monoxide alarm with an integrated speaker and Amazon Alexa support. Like Features built-in Amazon Alexa voice assistant. Supports multiple streaming music services. Gets loud enough. No Like Placement depends on your home smoke alarm setup. Installation is somewhat frustrating. Just a bit too expensive. Installing the Onelink is a procedure nearly identical to installing a normal hardwired smoke alarm, for better or worse. Remove the existing alarm and its mounting plate, screw the new mounting plate into the work box, plug your onelink into the existing connector, and attach the alarm to the mounting plate with a clockwise twist. The Onelink, when connected, will chirp every minute or so if mounted incorrectly, so make sure you’ve got a ladder and some free time. Thanks to either an overzealous tightening of the mounting plate or my frustrating attempts to install the alarm in a brutal heat wave, it took me over an hour to get it up and running. Since the Onelink is ceiling-mounted, it’s out of the way and easy to ignore. It uses that placement to its advantage, delivering a pretty impressive bass compared to desk-bound voice assistants or speakers. There’s nothing in the way to impede its audio quality either, making the Onelink reverberate from above like the voice of some synthetic deity. The Onelink doesn’t get as obnoxiously loud as my Google Home, nor is it comparable to the audio quality you’d get from something like a HomePod, but it doesn’t have to be as booming to effect the ambiance throughout my apartment. “It feels like I’m in a nice airport,” said my partner after walking through the hallway while the Onelink played some funk music. That placement also makes it easier for it to listen for voice assistant commands. The Onelink is in a hallway bisecting my apartment. Whether I was 30 feet away in the kitchen, as far as I can get from the Onelink, or in the bedroom (two feet from the Onelink) it was able to pick up my voice and respond to commands as quickly and seamlessly as an Amazon-made Echo device. Like an Echo device, the Onelink supports music streaming platforms Audible, Spotify, Pandora, and others, as well as Alexa skills you’ll probably never use. Alexa isn’t exactly the best at telling you whether or not your house is ablaze, even if you do enable the corresponding Onelink skill. When asked “Alexa, is my house on fire?” Alexa first attempted to play Rise Against’s “House on Fire,” then said it didn’t know what I was talking about when I repeated my question. To get actual answers, you’ll have to tell Alexa to ask Onelink about its status. Don’t worry about power outages or lost internet connections affecting its primary function as a smoke alarm. The photoelectric smoke alarm and electrochemical carbon monoxide detector components work as intended, and the Onelink lets out a piercing alarm paired with a too-pleasant voice declaring the source of the fire, which is basically the user-defined location of the Onelink itself. You’ll also receive a notification on your smartphone letting you know your house is going up in flames. If your home is wired to support interconnected alarms, it will trigger them all, ensuring you get the hell out of bed and out the door. The usefulness of a voice assistant and speaker jammed into a smoke alarm relies on its location, which is one of the few negative points of the Onelink Safe and Sound. You can only put it where you smoke alarms are. Unlike an Amazon Echo, that can sit on any counter, table, or ledge, the Onelink is a smoke alarm first, which means you’ll need to follow the instructions on smoke alarm placement and maintenance before you can enjoy its voice assistant features (at least if you want to remain up to code ). Onelink’s mere existence makes me feel, in all honestly, like throwing out the other voice assistants in my house and installing a few more smoke alarms. Granted, the Onelink’s installation requirements are largely dependent on your home and its safety setup, and I’m not exactly gearing up to install extra hardwired smoke alarms in my rented apartment, but I’d put one in each room if I could (or at least one in every room I can nap in). It’s out of the way, delivers clear and unobstructed audio, and adds a voice assistant to your home without it taking the form of a miniature obelisk. But $250 is quite a lot of cash to drop on something like this, making one consider whether a $15 smoke detector, a $15 wall mount, and a $100 Amazon Echo is worth the savings compared to the convenience of the Onelink Safe and Sound. README Great combination of functional smoke alarm and convenient Amazon Alexa voice assistant. HomeKit compatibility means one less smart device that doesn’t agree with your iPhone. Integrated speaker is cool, but won’t wow anyone. It’s expensive as hell, especially when you can get a voice assistant for under $100 and a smoke detector for $10. Nightlight feature is nice.","Many devices are now pulling double-duty these days. Game consoles are entertainment streaming devices.

PCMag,"Good news for Apple Music subscribers with an Amazon Fire TV: the music streaming service and media streaming devices now play nice together.
Three months after launching on Amazon Echo smart speakers, Apple Music is now available on Fire TV devices in the US. To set it up, enable the Apple Music skill inside the Alexa app and link your accounts. If you already enabled the Apple Music skill for use with an Echo device, you can start listening right away without having to go through the setup process again.
From there, you'll be able to ask the virtual assistant to play whatever you want to hear on Apple's music streaming service with commands such as ""Alexa, play today's hits on Apple Music"" or ""Alexa, play music by Bebe Rexha on Apple Music.""
If you live in the UK, don't feel too left out. Amazon says that Apple Music will also be available on Fire TV and Echo devices there ""in the coming weeks.""
Apple Music, which now boasts 50 million songs, earned an ""excellent"" rating in PCMag's review. We like its large music library, exclusive content, offline playback feature, Siri and Apple Watch integration, and more.
""Apple Music's many features make this service a strong contender in its category, one that challenges our Editors' Choices, Slacker Radio and Spotify,"" we wrote.
Meanwhile, several Amazon Fire TVs earned our coveted Editors' Choice recommendation, including the Fire TV Cube$119.99 at Amazon, Fire TV Stick 4K$49.99 at Amazon, and budget-friendly Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.

PCMag,"Back in January 2018, HP issued a battery recall covering 50,000 laptop batteries which had the potential to overheat and become either a burn of fire hazard. A year on, and the recall has been expanded to include a further 28,500 batteries taking the total up to 78,500.
The faulty batteries were shipped in a wide range of products or sold as accessories for those products. As the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website explains, the complete list includes ""HP ProBooks (64x G2 and G3 series, 65x G2 and G3 series, 4xx G4 series), HPx360 (310 G2), HP Pavilion x360 11inch Notebook PC, HP 11 Notebook PC, HP ZBook (17 G3, and Studio G3) mobile workstations. The batteries were also sold as accessories or replacement batteries for the HP ZBook Studio G4 mobile workstation, HP ProBook 4xx G5 series, HP ENVY 15, HP Mobile Thin Clients (mt21, mt22, and mt31).""
As Tom's Hardware reports, HP actually updated the recall in January this year, but not many people heard about it. The CPSC forms part of the US government, which was stuck in a shutdown at the time and therefore sharing of this new information didn't happen on its website immediately. That changed on March 12.
The advice for these newly added batteries is the same as it was last year. Visit the website www.HP.com/go/batteryprogram2018 to check if your battery is included in the recall. If it is, then instructions are provided on how to place your battery in a ""Battery Safety Mode."" Replacing them will require HP provide an authorized technician to remove the old, faulty unit and install a new one as the customer can't do it themselves.

Brian Heater,"Slowly but surely, Amazon’s been turning its Fire tablets into Echos. It started with push to talk Alexa function. Last year, the company added a hands-free mode for the voice assistant. Now, it’s adding Show Mode, which brings the same title card UI you get on the company’s screen-enabled smart speaker. Better still, Amazon’s introducing a Show Mode Charging Dock, a stand that effectively transforms the Fire into a makeshift Show. Place the tablet into a dock and it starts charging and automatically flips into Show mode, so you can do all of the standard Echo activities from across the room. The dock works with both the most recent Fire HD 8 and 10 (if I had to venture a guess, I’d say the 7 will probably be getting the functionality, as well). If you already have one of the devices, the feature will be coming through an over-the-air update starting July 2. Once it’s in place, it will play nicely with other Echos in your home, using Amazon’s ESP (“Echo Spatial Perception”) feature. I’d have to imagine a new, less bulky version of the Show is in the works. In the meantime, this is a pretty compelling alternative — and a chance for Amazon to be a bit more competitive with the numerous third-party devices Google unveiled back at CES. The tablet+dock package is ultimately a cheaper option than the Show’s $230 price tag (though that device is discounted to $160 at the moment). The docks themselves run $40 for the eight-inch and $55 for the 10 (both are discounted $5 for the time being). If you don’t already have the tablets on-hand, you can pick up a bundle for $110 and $190, respectively. Picking up this configuration also gives you a lot more flexibility versus just going in on the Show. As for what the Show brings to the table? Better built-in mics and speakers are the primary answer. Ultimately, however, I suspect Amazon isn’t really concerned about some of its devices cannibalizing others, so long as it gets more Amazon products out in the world.","Slowly but surely, Amazon’s been turning its Fire tablets into Echos.

Peter Rubin,"You can find WIRED a lot of places these days. Theres the magazine, of course (which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year!). Theres this website, which you might be reading on a laptop or tablet but are probably reading on your phone. Theres YouTube and Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat and Glizznork, all but one of which are very real things. But starting today, theres a new addition to that panoply of platforms: your television. To be fair, WIRED has been on TV before WIRED Science aired on PBS for one glorious season back in 2007. Television has changed a lot since then, though; a little thing called streaming, another little thing called on-demand, and a bunch of little sticks and boxes that bypass cable and beam video straight onto your sets. So here to harness the power of all those changes is the WIRED OTT Channel. (For those who dont read trade publications, OTT stands for over the top, and just means a streaming media source that bypasses cable or broadcast providers.) The service officially launched in July, but today marks the premiere of a whole slew of titles and content that you cant find anywhere else. What does that include? So glad you asked! Well, theres [De]constructed, a new show in which we break down the hardware used to build popular vehicles and gadgetslike a Harley Davidson motorcycle or a high-end watchboth literally and figuratively. (That's the trailer above.) On WIRED Masterminds, experts in various fields let you inside the finer points of their work, from a CIA disguise master to a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor. Weve also got 64 episodes of the BBC tech series Click, now available for the first time in North America. And soon, youll be able to watch exclusive content from the upcoming WIRED25 celebration in San Francisco, featuring footage and interviews with the most influential names in technology, including Bill Gates, Satya Nadella, Susan Wojcicki, Sundar Pichai, and more. If youre already a fan of our YouTube and web serieslike Autocomplete Interviews, Tech Support, and Almost Impossible youll be able to find those too.

Kellen Beck,"At this point, it seems like winter may never actually come for A Song of Ice and Fire. George R.R. Martin, author of A Song of Ice and Fire (a.k.a. Game of Thrones ), dashed fans' hopes of reading his next novel Winds of Winter this year in a blog post Wednesday, but at least he announced the release date of his book about the history of the Targaryens: Fire and Blood. Fans of A Song of Ice and Fire have been waiting since 2011's A Dance with Dragons for the sixth book of Martin's series, Winds of Winter, which has been teased since the last book's release. Some expected it to release before the HBO series Game of Thrones reached that point in the story, but we're way passed that now. SEE ALSO: George R.R. Martin Releases Chapter From New 'Game of Thrones' Book Instead of finishing Winds of Winter, it seems that Martin is more preoccupied with helping to produce and work on the TV show as well as adding to the Ice and Fire universe without actually progressing the main series. He has released a handful of books and short story collections that take place within the world of Westeros and Essos, but they're about events from before A Song of Ice and Fire. Fire and Blood, which Martin announced will be coming out on Nov. 20, falls right in line. The book is the first of two parts that describe the history of the Targaryens — the house of Daenerys Targaryen that was famous for its friendly relationship with dragons. In his blog post, Martin describes the book as ""hefty,"" but it's not quite as long as his other Ice and Fire novels. ""This first volume covers all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane), along with their wives, wars, siblings, children, friends, rivals, laws, travels, and sundry other matters."" Martin said. ""For those not up on your Westerosi history, that’s Aegon I, Aenys, Maegor the Cruel, Jaehaerys I (the Conciliator), Viserys I, Aegon II (and Rhaenyra), and Aegon III (the regency). Oh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons."" For anyone who are like me and wanted to wait to read the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire before watching or catching up on HBO's Game of Thrones, just bite the bullet and watch it. The show is great, as I learned just months ago (about five years since I first finished the novels). Winds of Winter could come out in 2030 for all we know.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"The program has increasingly drawn scrutiny from criminal justice reform advocates, who have called it one of the most striking examples of undercompensated prison labor. It also illustrates how convictions can have lasting impacts on peoples lives, said Angela Hanks, the director of the Center for Postsecondary and Economic Success at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington-based nonprofit group that promotes policies that help low-income Americans. Ms. Hanks said that incentives given to prisoners to join the fire camps, such as reduced sentences, might draw some who would otherwise not want to join the program. It is such a dangerous job, she said. At a minimum, people should be paid a fair wage. Once they are released from prison, inmates find it difficult to join the ranks of professional firefighters, said Katherine Katcher, the founder and executive director of Root and Rebound, a nonprofit group that helps people with criminal histories re-enter society. Some former inmates, like Ms. Mota, dont bother applying, Ms. Katcher said. Some fire departments also bar people with certain criminal backgrounds from becoming firefighters, she said. For example, the fire department in Bakersfield, a city of more than 380,000 people in Southern California, said it disqualified applicants who have been convicted of a felony. In the Los Angeles County Fire Department, felonies and some misdemeanors are grounds for disqualification, said Capt. Tony Imbrenda, a department spokesman. I can tell you that someone who has been incarcerated and part of an inmate hand crew has no chance of employment with this agency, he said. Various counties also have restrictions on who can get a license to be an emergency medical technician, which is required by many fire departments in California, Ms. Katcher said. State law directs local E.M.S. agencies to deny an E.M.T. certification if the person has been convicted of two or more felonies, or has been convicted of any theft-related misdemeanor in the preceding five years, among other possible factors.","About 1,500 inmates in California prisons are helping the state fight wildfires, including the Camp Fire, for several dollars a day.

Greg Kumparak,"Rumors have been floating around for a few months now of a new device from Amazon that would mash up the media streaming capabilities of its Fire TV line with the voice assistant abilities of the Echo. After leaked images turned up showing a cube-shaped device that seemed to fit the bill, people started referring to this still as-of-yet unannounced device as the “Fire TV Cube”. Sure enough: a seemingly official page has been found tucked away on Amazon.com that mentions a Fire TV Cube, and promises “details coming soon.” As found by AFTVNews, the placeholder splash page offers up little beyond the promise of eventual details. It’s got a big ol’ header that says “What is Fire TV Cube?”, a button to let you sign up for more details, and… well, that’s about it.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Photo Parts of downtown Reno, Nev., were blocked Tuesday as the police responded to gunfire coming from a luxury high-rise. Credit Andy Barron/The Reno Gazette-Journal, via Associated Press RENO, Nev. — A gunman holding a hostage opened fire from the eighth floor of a luxury high-rise condominium in Reno, Nev., on Tuesday, shooting for about 20 minutes onto the streets below, the authorities said. No injuries were reported. The man died Tuesday after a SWAT team descended on him while he was barricaded at the high-rise, known as the Montage, Deputy Chief Tom Robinson said. It was not immediately clear whether he was killed by police gunfire or his own. No one else, including the hostage, was hurt. The gunman’s name has not been released. Chief Robinson described him only as a young adult. The condominium tower is surrounded by some of downtown Reno’s most popular casinos, and the gunfire brought eerie echoes of the Las Vegas rampage that killed dozens two months ago. But aside from the gunman no one was reported hurt in Tuesday’s attack, as the streets were mostly empty on a cold weeknight. Stephen Paddock, the man who opened fire on Oct. 1 in Las Vegas from the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino onto an outdoor concert below, killing 58 people, had owned a unit at the Montage. Records show he sold the property last December. “When you heard it’s coming from above it reminds you of the guy shooting from Mandalay Bay,” said Mike Pavicich, who was in Reno on business from Las Vegas and was standing atop a parking garage at the neighboring Eldorado Resort Casino when the shots rang out. “It’s scary, you know?” Mr. Pavicich told The Las Vegas Review-Journal. “This is the same kind of town.” Continue reading the main story","The attacker died, but no one else was injured in an episode reminiscent of the Las Vegas hotel killings two months ago.",2017-11-29T07:17:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Gunman Opens Fire From Reno Condominium,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/us/gunman-shooting-reno-condominium.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/world/30reno-1/30reno-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fire,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Im going to stay here in Chico and just become one of Chicos homeless people until I can get back up the hill, said Ms. Roberts, 73, who lost her home in Paradise and had been staying with her dog, Princess, at the Neighborhood Church shelter in Chico, an official Red Cross site that closed and moved farther away last week. FEMA couldnt seem to help me, the Red Cross couldnt seem to help me, I havent had one penny for relocation, I havent been approached that theres a room in town other people have, but Ive received nothing, and we dont have anywhere to go. Sites like the Walmart lot, where many self-described burnouts those who lost their homes to the Camp Fire have taken refuge, pose considerable dangers. Several volunteers said they had seen people who were displaced by the fires become targets for theft by those who were already homeless. Theyve been through the good, the bad and the ugly here, said Rich Wilson, 68, a volunteer outside Walmart. James Tyler Steen, 49, who had been homeless in Paradise for five years and has been living on the grass outside Walmart since the fire, said there is a big difference between the original homeless population and more recent additions. Youve got the parking lot, and then youve got the field, he said, referring to the division of space outside the shop. Money is the difference. Their needs are met; these needs arent. These guys take their needs, these guys buy their needs. Mr. Brown acknowledged that there were tensions, but he added that in the midst of it all, there was also some camaraderie and a shared sympathy for the desperation of the situation. The homeless here are actually teaching the people who have never been homeless how to survive, he said, like how to stay safe in the tents, where to find food, and how to keep warm as flash floods bore down from the recent rains. And thats a big positive, he said.","A chimney was all that the Camp Fire left standing of a house in Paradise, Calif., one of 14,000 residences destroyed in Butte County. The number of people seeking housing in the county has vastly increased since the fire.",2018-12-03T10:00:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After a California Wildfire, New and Old Homeless Populations Collide",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/california-fire-homeless.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/30/us/00homeless-01/00homeless-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fire,1
Sarah Perez,"Alexa calling, the feature that lets users place voice and video calls from Alexa devices, like the Echo, is now coming to tablets. Amazon announced this morning added support for calling as well as messaging features on tablets including iPads, Android tablets, and of course its own Fire tablets. On the Fire HD 10, Alexa calling and voice messages will be available hands-free – you can just ask Alexa to take action. Meanwhile, on the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 or older generation Fire tablets, you’ll instead press the Home button to place a call or send a message. The devices will also support Drop In – the feature that lets you use Alexa devices as an intercom system of sorts, where you can instantly connect with other devices around the home, or in friends’ and families’ homes, if you choose to enable it. To use the calling and messaging features, you’ll need the latest version of the Alexa app and will need to verify your phone number and import your contacts. The expanded support for voice calls and messaging is the latest example of how Amazon’s Alexa app is becoming more than an utility for managing the settings on Echo devices or Alexa’s smart home integrations. Amazon had announced in January that the app would also be expanded to include voice integration, meaning users could speak to Alexa in a dedicated app instead of only through Alexa devices (or oddly, the Amazon shopping app which got Alexa integration first.) With support for calling, messaging, and voice commands, Amazon has a way to establish a presence on mobile, where it had earlier failed with its its own Amazon-branded Fire Phone smartphones. It gives Amazon a chance to dive into social and messaging, too, where it had never directly competed before. The new calling support is available in the latest version of the Alexa iOS and Android application, says Amazon.","Alexa calling, the feature that lets users place voice and video calls from Alexa devices, like the Echo, is now coming to tablets.

Jacob Kleinman,"Amazon and Google have been duking it out for the past few months, and it doesn’t look like the two companies will come to an agreement anytime soon. Earlier this month, Google announced plans to pull its YouTube app from Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices, along with the Echo Show, starting on January 1. Thankfully, there’s a solution waiting in the wings. On Wednesday, Mozilla revealed its new Firefox browser app for Fire TV with support for YouTube videos. The application makes it easy to browse the web on your television, search for videos, and go directly to any website by typing in the URL. It even includes a shortcut to YouTube right from the Firefox home screen, so you’ll only have to click one more time than you would have with the official YouTube app. You can download and install Firefox straight from your Fire TV by selecting the search icon in the top right corner of the home screen and searching “Firefox,”or just hold down the microphone button on your Fire TV remote and say “Firefox.” Then select “Firefox for Fire TV” from the list of results and click on “Get” to install it. You can also download the app from Amazon.com. Just click on the dropdown menu next to the search bar and pick “Apps &amp; Games.” Search for “Firefox” and select the new app. Then make sure the “Deliver to” line on the right side of the page is directed to your Fire TV device before hitting “Get” to install it. Once the Firefox app is installed all you have to do is open it and click on the YouTube icon. You’ll be watching music videos, video game streams, and old Vine compilations in no time.","Amazon and Google have been duking it out for the past few months, and it doesn’t look like the two companies will come to an agreement anytime soon.

Dana Froome,"The skys the limit when it comes to entertainment. You can visit an old-school cinema to see a movie, watch sitcoms reruns on TV, or create your own at-home theater experience with a streaming service. Even though we have all these options at our fingertips, they can come with some inconveniences. First, going to a local IMAX hub isnt as budget-friendly as it used to be. Then, theres the chance that the internet might crap out when youre watching your favorite Netflix series. And on top of all that, who wants to pay for an expensive cable bill? If youre over pricey tickets, connectivity issues, and cable payments, theres hope. You can avoid these situations and buy a streaming media player. These devices can be game changers when it comes to watching your favorite movies and shows. Theyll take the hassle out of your next binge-watching session, so you can curl up on the couch, eat some popcorn, and relax for hours. Sounds simple, right? SEE ALSO: What's the difference between the Echo and the Echo Dot? There are many streaming media players available for your entertainment needs. Amazon, a leader in the technology space, offers two popular streaming media players: the Fire TV and the Fire TV Stick. These devices have similar names, but each have different pros and cons for streaming. In 2014, Amazon launched the first generation Fire TV, a box that plugs into HDTVs for instant access to Hulu Plus, Netflix, Prime Instant Video, Showtime, WatchESPN, and low-cost video rentals. With its Advanced Streaming and Prediction (ASAP) feature, it predicts which TV episodes and films you want to watch and buffers them for instant viewing. This tiny device is a milestone for streaming, because it allows people to enjoy entertainment whenever and wherever they want. The Fire TV was followed by a second generation in 2015, which included more processing power, 4K support, and Alexa integration. Today, you can purchase the Fire TV with 4K Ultra HD and an Alexa Voice Remote, which features detailed contrast, access to over 500,000 movies and TV episodes, and expanded voice control. After the Fire TVs successful launch, Amazon debuted the first generation Fire TV Stick, a smaller and more affordable streaming media player, in October 2014. Like the Fire TV, the first Fire TV Stick provides the same instant streaming perks, except it has a slightly different design. Rather than a box, it is a small stick that connects to HDMI ports on HDTVs. Today, you can buy the second generation Fire TV Stick, which is up to 30 percent faster than the first generation model, offers access to over 500,000 movies and TV episodes, and includes the Alexa Voice Remote. Even though both devices have a similar purpose providing stress-free entertainment access both offer different benefits and features when it comes to streaming content. Ready to upgrade your streaming experience? Heres what you need to know if youre deciding between the Fire TV and the Fire TV Stick. The basics Fire TV The Fire TV is a streaming media player part of the Amazon Fire TV Family. Its a device with many streaming benefitspacked with high-tech features and the power to deliver an immersive entertainment experience. Key features include advanced 4K Ultra HD streaming, access to over 500,000 films and TV episodes, and more voice control options with Alexa, Amazons virtual assistant. Image: amazon The Fire TV weighs 3.1 ounces and its dimensions are 2.6 inches x 2.6 inches x 0.6 inches. It has a slim square shape, a standard HDMI Male, and a micro USB port for power or an optional Amazon Ethernet Adapter. Its stays concealed behind your HDTV, so theres no need to worry about any cords or wires poking out. Using the Fire TV is easy. All you have to do is plug the Fire TV into your HDTVs HDMI port, insert its USB cable and power adapter into a wall outlet, and connect to the internet through Wi-Fi or an optional Amazon Ethernet Adapter to watch movies and TV shows. A cool highlight of the Fire TV is that it works with Alexa. The Alexa Voice Remote can help you find, start, and control digital content for seamless streaming. The Fire TV can be paired with Echo devices as well, so you can use Alexa for hands-free control when you watch films or TV episodes. Plus, you can use Alexa on your Fire TV via the Alexa Voice Remote to play music, check the weather, and listen to the news. Each Fire TV set includes a Fire TV streaming media player, an Alexa Voice Remote (First Generation), a USB cable and power adapter, two AAA batteries, a quick start guide, and a product guide. Fire TV Stick If youre on an entertainment budget, the Fire TV Stick offers similar streaming perks as the Fire TV at a fraction of the price. As an Amazon Fire TV Family device, this streaming media player has key entertainment benefits, including good picture quality, access to over 500,000 movies and TV episodes, and the ability to control content with an Alexa Voice Remote (same First Generation model used with Fire TV). Image: amazon The Fire TV Stick weighs 1.1 ounces and its dimensions are 3.4 inches x 1.2 inches x 0.5 inches. Its shape resembles a USB flash drive, unlike the Fire TV which looks more like a square. Because it weighs less than the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick might fit better behind HDTVs and works great for on-the-go entertainment. Like the Fire TV, the Fire TV Stick doesnt take much effort to operate. Plug the Fire TV Stick into your HDTV, attach the power adapter, connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, and then you can start streaming movies and TV episodes.

Theres HDR for true-to-life imaging and 4K Ultra HD streaming at up to 60 fps, so you wont have to watch a fuzzy screen.

Reviews Fire TV Sally B., an Amazon customer, writes: When I saw that Amazon launched this new version, the 4K ULTRA HD FIRE TV, we ordered it that day. I was concerned that it would be hard to set up or confusing to use, it is not. Actually, it was easy. It is very nicely boxed and the instructions are straight forward. We do not have an Alexa, so we had to remember to hold down the button and speak. How easy is that to do! No more scrolling through channels and trying to press the buttons to try to punch in programs, or movies. There are so many choices of movies, specials, sports, and programs that there are not enough hours in the day to watch them. And TS, another Amazon reviewer, says: I love this thing! It allowed me to cut the cord on cable which has become ridiculous. With cable, I am getting channels I don't watch or care about nor do I spend that much time watching cable. I am binge watcher and news junkie. Other half is sports freak. So, we get what we want without the hefty price tag. I still have a ways to go with the learning curve and I have since learned I didn't probably need one for every TV. So oh well. I was just so excited knowing I could give Comcast cable the boot, it was all I could do to contain myself. Fire TV Stick Amazon reviewer art-dog 3 writes: Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and I am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. And Sofa Kingdom, another Amazon customer, says: Great price. I bought the Fire Stick on Amazon's Summer Black Friday for $20. I ""cut the cord"" years ago and rely on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu for my family's TV entertainment. The Fire Stick's user interface is more pleasurable visually and easier to set up, change settings, and watch. Alexa is a great feature. Just push a button and say what you're looking for. The Fire Stick also gives the ability to directly access the internet. Something the other devices do not allow. So which one should you choose? For an immersive binge-watching session, the Fire TV is your best pick for a streaming media player. It offers 4K Ultra HD and HDR picture quality, theater-like audio, Alexa Voice Remote for seamless searching, launching, and playing, and the ability to go beyond streaming commands with Alexa. If you dont want to spend a lot on streaming media player, the Fire TV Stick offers similar perks to the Fire TV at a fraction of the price. You wont get the same 4K Ultra HD and HDR settings, but you will still have high-quality images and sounds when youre watching your favorite movies, TV episodes, and programs. You can use an Alexa Voice Remote for seamless content commands, like playing music, finding a film, or ordering a pizza. Plus, its super portable, just in case youre traveling and need to catch up on your latest show.","The sky’s the limit when it comes to entertainment.

Mark Kaufman,"Thousands of miles away from the deadly deluges brought by the now-tropical depression Florence, wildland firefighters are still battling extreme blazes out West. An intense video posted to Instagram on Sunday shows a firefighting crew's violent meeting with a large fire vortex, known scientifically as a fire whirl. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Wildland firefighter M.C. Schidlowsky — whose Instagram handle is mar.lowsky — posted the video taken in British Columbia, showing the vortex sucking a firehose up into the churning winds. The crew was powerless pull the heavy hose back. One firefighter, after the vortex ripped the hose away, hurled a rock at the fire, seemingly in frustration. This fire whirl event was starkly different than the colossal fire tornado spawned during California's Carr Fire in July, wherein a towering 16,000 foot-tall inferno spun in the City of Redding. ""It’s a classic fire whirl,"" Michael Gollner, a fire scientist who researches fire whirls at the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering, said in an interview. ""It's very common for smaller whirls to occur in fires,"" said Gollner. ""They’re more akin to dust devils."" Still, these fire whirls aren't weak events. Firehoses are heavy, especially the metal nozzles. This whirl sucked the hose up like paper. ""There was clearly a lot of momentum to have that much suction and pull,"" said Gollner, who could only speculate that the whirling winds were well over 100 mph. ""There was quite a bit of weight it was pulling up."" ""I’ve never seen a hose sucked up into a fire whirl before,"" he added. For any whirl to form amid a fire, something must cause a swirling motion, like erratic winds or gusts spinning off hills or topography. Such events are evidently quite common. ""It's very easy to generate a fire whirl,"" said Gollner. Although the events are common in fires, it's likely these vortexes are seen even more these days than they were 30 years ago. The reason is simple: The climate is warming, which means considerably more dried-out land and enhanced fire conditions in previous decades. About twice as much land burns in the U.S. today than in the early 1980s, and climate change is an integral reason why. ""There are more extreme fire weather days and more extreme drought than what was happening 30 years ago,"" noted Gollner. ""The more days that you have extreme fries, the more likelihood you have to see giant fire whirls."" In August — well before the fire season is through — 2018 became British Columbia's worst fire season in recorded history. The firefighters in this video — for reasons known to these professionals working in the area — did not flee from this particular fire whirl. Though usually, anyone in the vicinity would be wise get a good distance from such a vortex, as they regularly throw flaming objects into the air and can ignite the vegetation behind you. ""That can be really dangerous,"" said Gollner. ""Typically, you see a fire whirl and you would leave the area — they tend to be unpredictable events."" ""Personally, I would have gotten away,"" he said.","Thousands of miles away from the deadly deluges brought by the now-tropical depression Florence, wildland firefighters are still battling extreme blazes out West.

Cameron Faulkner,"Amazon’s kid-focused tablets have been discounted since last week, and now the sale has extended to its main lineup, including the Fire 7, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10. Depending on the tablet you choose, the savings range from $10 to $30 off until November 3rd. That’s not bad for options that already fall well below or near the $100 price point. If you’re a bit confused about which tablet is best for you, it really comes down to cost, size, and screen resolution. All of them include expandable storage via their microSD slot, so storage capacity shouldn’t necessarily dictate which one you buy, unless you foresee using it up all at once. At these prices, each one comes with Amazon’s lock screen ads, which help to drive down the cost, though you can pay more to either opt out at the time of purchase, or you can do so at a later date. Compared to more expensive Android tablets and Apple’s iPad, Amazon’s tablets aren’t nearly as capable and aren’t a good fit if you see yourself getting into anything more than light work. While easy to beat in terms of performance, Amazon’s tablet lineup has been unbeatable when it comes to providing the entertainment mainstays, like Prime Video, HBO Go, Netflix, and more, at a low cost. We’re likely to see more tempting offers once Black Friday and Cyber Monday come around, though given how affordable these tablets already are, we don’t see buyers being blindsided too heavily.","Amazon’s Fire tablets don’t stack up to the performance found in the iPad or other Android tablets, but if you’re hunting for a cheap tablet that can serve up entertainment, they can’t be beat.",2018-10-29T18:57:20Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Amazon’s budget-friendly Fire tablet lineup is even cheaper this week,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2018/10/29/18039298/amazos-fire-tablet-sale,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EX7ULMK813t9qTutRl39tElzF-A=/0x150:2040x1218/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9027825/dbohn170809_1909_0003.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fire,1
Alice Bradley,"I love a yule log, but I’m not a fan of a fireplace. A fireplace requires tending. Also, you have to worry about carbon monoxide poisoning, rogue embers that can leap out and set fire to you at any time, and animals tumbling down and getting caught in your flue. (I’m not 100% on how fireplaces work.) So if I want some cozy fireplace action in my living room come Christmas morning, I’m just going to turn on the television, fire up the Roku (I’m not clear on how the Roku works, either) and choose a Yule Log selection from Amazon Instant Video. (Note: I have chosen Amazon Instant Video because I have Prime, and because the Youtube Channel refuses to work on my Roku. It is the crashiest.) That said, not all yule logs are created equal. That is why I have reviewed a selection of the best. For you. All for you. Holiday Family Favorites: Yule Log This would be a solid choice except for the intermittent flashes, like someone’s mom is taking photos of the pretty fire. You don’t need a flash for that, mom. Also, the crackling is a little too shrill and insistent. Settle down, yule log. It seems so logical—you want your couch facing your fireplace and your TV, and right above the… Read more Read Christmas Yule Log 8 Hours of Crackling Fire - Naturescapes Christmas Yule Log is a solid, unexciting option. I already missed the warmth of “Holiday Family Favorites.” Some feisty crackles offset the low roar of the fireplace. Sometimes it sounds like someone is popping bubble wrap which may or may not be a plus for you. The Ultimate Yule Log: The Light of Christmas Calling a yule log “ultimate” is really setting you up for failure if you’re not prepared to offer the very best. And this one is not. The hearth is blackened with soot, the fire is middling at best … but even worse, there’s music. Do not play Carol of the Bells at me, Ultimate Yule Log. I prefer to go elsewhere for my music choices. Fireplace for Your Home Presents: Christmas Music Edition This is a lovely, lively fire —ruined, of course, by the music. In their defense, the title provided ample warning of what I was getting myself into. Yule Log Yule Log, on the other hand, knows what’s what. Yule Log’s just coming here to tell you what Yule Log is. It’s Yule Log: no more, no less. There is an intriguing teepee-like structure to the logs, and there’s no, what do you call it, the thing that holds the logs in the fireplace. At any rate, the fire is the perfect combo of crackle and hum, and I felt cozier just watching. Yule Log! For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read Festive Yule Log On the heels of the humble Yule Log comes Festive Yule Log, which is not. Festive Yule Log seems to exist in an inky void. And out of the void, weirdly, there seems to be a… a person, tending to the fire. “Everyone knows the best part of the yule log is when the fire tender adds new logs or pokes at the existing ones,” reads the description. I did not know this. I thought the best part was when you enjoyed the fire without wondering where the disembodied poker was coming from and what it was going to do next. Christmas Yule Log - Naturescapes This one worried me a little, since the description read that it stars “John of Light.” John, fortunately, never shows up. Instead, you get a hearty fire peppered with just the right amount of crackling. Still, I couldn’t shake the idea that John was there. That John is watching us all, always. Fantasy Fireplace: Christmas Edition By “fantasy,” they mean “fake.” Everything here is digital: the fire, the fireplace, the stockings hung by the fireplace, the wrapped gifts, the Christmas tree in the foreground. It is terrible and should never be watched. Yule Log Christmas Fireplace 10 Hours This one is creepy as fuck. First of all, I’m fairly sure, but not 100% sure, that that is not a real fire. If the Uncanny Valley can exist for yule logs, we are right in it. Second, the fire is centered within a nondescript fireplace that takes up most of the frame. No one cares about your dumb fireplace, Rex Dormis. (Rex is listed as the star of this yule log, so I imagine that he’s the owner of the fireplace. Right? Or he lives among the pretend flames? I don’t know anything anymore.)","I love a yule log, but I’m not a fan of a fireplace.

TIM ARANGO,"Upper Lake — founded in 1854, a red archway in town announces — lies just beyond the checkpoint to the evacuation zone, which is managed by the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. Upper Lake was settled by two Anglo-Americans who had helped lead a revolt against Mexican rule in nearby Sonoma, a nugget of history written on the back of the postcards Mr. Lynch has stacked on the front counter. Upper Lake’s main street is a line of Old West-style storefronts, and with the evacuation of most residents, the place had the feel of a ghost town. Mr. Lynch described the area as economically depressed, and a place where people like to be left alone by the government. And even amid a devastating fire season and news reports about rising temperatures, there is plenty of skepticism over climate change. “Millions of years ago, I’m sure they had fires that raged and raged for months — it just so happens that we are in one of those cycles,” Mr. Lynch said. Other residents have stayed behind because they are worried about looters, concerned that they would return to find “their back doors kicked in,” he said. As he spoke, one of his regulars, Steve Lugger, came in to buy cat litter. “I’m the last living one in my family, and I just wanted to live in my house,” said Mr. Lugger, 68. “And I have 12 cats to take care of.” On a normal day, you can see clear across the lake, where almost every weekend there is a bass fishing tournament. But the fires have brought a thick haze of smoke.","We drove roughly 50 miles along Highway 20, from the firefighters’ base camp to the town of Clearlake Oaks, while the region was still under a mandatory evacuation order.",2018-08-10T09:40:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Inside the Mendocino Complex Fire Evacuation Zone,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/california-fires-mendocino-complex.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/10/us/10MENDOCINO-lede-01/merlin_142146867_cafa7abc-2773-4803-8940-5e862575bb04-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fire,1

The DJI Mavic 2 Pro is $150 off for Verge readers, thanks to an exclusive discount from Wellbots. This is the cheapest that we’ve seen this drone sell for, and to get the deal for yourself, enter THEVERGEFLY at checkout. In The Verge review, Vjeran Pavic praises this drone for the quality footage gathered by its Hasselblad sensor, and for being easy to use. TCL’s 65-inch 6-series 4K Roku TV is still at its cheapest price ever. Normally around $1,000, it’s currently $829.99. Verge editor Chris Welch calls this model “the best 4K TV to buy under $1,000” in the review. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge I know that you might be trying to hide from all of the Samsung news, but today is a good time to invest in a wireless charging pad, since a bunch of recently announced phones support wireless charging. That includes the new Xiaomi Mi 9, Vivo V15 Pro, and likely, the lot of Samsung Galaxy S10 phones. Samsung’s dual wireless charging pad isn’t the most affordable wireless charger, though it can charge two phones (or, a phone and smartwatch) simultaneously. You can find one at Amazon right now for less than $70 in black or white.

Sarah Perez,"The feud between Amazon and Google continues today with the early removal of YouTube from the Fire TV – a move Google had said wouldn’t take place until January 1, 2018. But as a number of Fire TV owners have now noticed, launching the YouTube app today informs you that you can choose to watch “YouTube and millions of other websites” by using a web browser. You then have the option to choose from Amazon’s own Silk browser or Firefox, with a click of a button. The disagreements between the companies that led to this consumer-unfriendly stance go back several years. Google hasn’t been happy about Amazon’s anti-competitive nature when it comes to allowing rivals to sell their own hardware items – like smart speakers and media players – on Amazon.com. The retailer has long refused to stock devices that competed with its own, including Apple TV, Chromecast, Google Home, and others in an effort to promote its products like the Echo and Fire TV. However, Amazon and Apple recently negotiated an agreement that brought the Apple TV back to Amazon, and Amazon’s Prime Video app to Apple TV. Meanwhile, it seemed discussions between Amazon and Google were improving earlier this month when the Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra reappeared on Amazon.com. The other issue at hand was that Amazon had launched its own version of Google’s YouTube player for its Echo Show device, without working with Google to ensure core features were accessible. There’s been quite a bit of back and forth on this matter, with Google pulling that player, only to have Amazon surreptitiously work around the block by implementing a web version of YouTube instead. That led Google this month to declare that it would pull YouTube entirely from Amazon’s hardware lineup, including Fire TV. The player was yanked immediately from Echo Show, but Fire TV owners were told that the app would work until January 1, 2018. It would be unusual for Google to actually pull the YouTube app ahead of its deadline, which indicates this change – to point YouTube users to web browsers instead – may have come from Amazon’s side. That theory is further backed up by the fact that sideloading the YouTube app onto Fire TV will continue to display the “warning” message, according to a report from AFTVNews.com and commenters on Reddit. Above: Warning screen; Image credit – AFTVNews.com However, it’s unclear if Amazon’s choice to redirect YouTube users to web browsers ahead of schedule is fully rolled out. One report from Cord Cutter News found that you’ll only see the browser choice screen if you have a browser installed on your Fire TV, for example. On two Fire TV devices we have here (a prior generation and new generation player), we’re only seeing the browser choice screen as of today. And many users worldwide are reporting the same, per Twitter. Fire TV: Amazon kommt Googles Youtube-Abschaltung zuvor https://t.co/ZdUqiL518n Die Youtube-App auf dem Fire TV funktioniert nicht mehr.

Google has not yet responded, but a rep from Amazon offered the following statement: “I can confirm that YouTube and millions of other websites are accessible by using a web browser like Firefox or Silk on Fire TV.” With all this drama, is it any wonder that Roku is the top streaming device in the U.S.? Consumers don’t want to be jerked around like this all because two competitors can’t work out a reasonable solution that serves both their interests.

Chaim Gartenberg,"At CES 2019, TiVo announced that it will begin offering a new streaming app for the Roku, Fire TV, and Apple TV streaming devices later this year, which will allow users stream live and recorded shows in their home without investing in separate hardware like the TiVo Mini Vox. But according to an interview with Ted Malone, TiVo’s VP of consumer products and services, those apps will be pretty limited, only offering streaming at 720p quality and 30 fps, via TechHive. Better streaming may be possible, but right now, the apps are stuck with 720p The apps apparently look similar to TiVo’s existing UI, albeit at lower resolutions than users may have hoped for. “I want 720p 60 [fps],” Malone said in the interview. “I’ve done some internal demos proving that 720p 60 [fps] is actually noticeably better than 720p 30. It’s really a battle for resources and just getting it done.” Additionally, AppleInsider notes that native MPEG-2 broadcasts, 5.1 surround sound, and TiVo’s automatic commercial jumping “ SkipMode ” won’t work with the app either. TiVo still offers the TiVo Mini Vox, which supports all of the features, including higher resolution streaming, that the company will happily sell you for $180 each. But it’s probably to be expected that TiVo would put more time and resources into optimizing its own paid hardware over a free app for another platform. Per an earlier report from Zatz Not Funny, the new TiVo apps are set to arrive sometime in the second or third quarter of 2019 — first to the Fire TV, then Roku, and finally to the Apple TV — although exact dates haven’t been announced yet.","TiVo’s upcoming Apple TV, Roku, and Fire TV streaming apps that were announced at CES will have a big caveat when they launch:  they’ll be limited to just 720p and 30 fps streaming",2019-01-24T16:20:38Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",TiVo’s new streaming apps will be limited to 720p and 30 fps,https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195872/tivo-streaming-apps-apple-tv-fire-roku-720p-30fps,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtD7_Rr5fKxhJogsdnrIo3vQApQ=/0x8:4096x2153/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13162763/TiVo_BOLT_OTA_Living_Room_3.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fire,1

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Another day, another chemical plant fire. Thats the depressing reality in the Houston area. Barely two weeks after a chemical plant fire belched a cloud of toxic smoke over the city of Deer Park, Texas, another plant burst into flames Tuesday in Crosby, Texas, just a half hour drive north.
This time, a worker was killed and another two were severely injured, the Harris County Sheriffs Office reports. And authorities are wasting no time to act: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton moved to sue KMCO LLC., the owner of the plant, Tuesday night on behalf of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).
I offer my condolences to the families who have suffered injury or loss and to the community impacted by the KMCO fire earlier today, said TCEQ Executive Director Toby Baker, in a statement. I applaud the attorney general for acting swiftly on my requests to hold KMCO fully responsible.
So far, all that the Harris County Sheriffs Office knows, according to its Facebook, is that a line caught fire near a tank full of isobutylene, a flammable gas, which then burst into flames. The countys fire marshals have been on site to try and determine the exact cause of the fire, per Sheriff Ed Gonzalezs Facebook.The Harris County Fire Marshal Office is leading the origin and cause investigation, Rachel Moreno, the offices public information officer, told Earther.
The TCEQ moved much more quickly after this fire compared with the first one. For the Deer Park fire, which caused about a thousand locals to seek medical treatment, the commission waited five days before filing a lawsuit against plant owner Intercontinental Terminals Company. Both lawsuits are seeking penalties for alleged violations of the Texas Clean Air Act. Luckily, this latest fire was put out within 24 hours, a stark difference from the last plants fire, which billowed millions of pounds oftoxic pollutants like into the air on and off for nearly a week.
At the Crosby plant, the fire resulted in 2,300 pounds of pollutants shooting into the air, according to the TCEQ. Its a comparably small incident, but isobutylene, toluene, and volatile organic compounds were all in the mixand can be bad for your health. Toluene, for instance, can cause birth defects in unborn children if inhaled in large quantities.
Local concentrations of every single one of these pollutants temporarilyshot past the states emissions limits. According to the TCEQs only air monitor in the region, the ozone levels spiked 48 parts per billion in the afternoon Tuesday. The Environmental Protection Agency marks 70 parts per billion of ozone as its health standard.
Earther has reached out to the TCEQ for comment on how it plans to remediate any health or environmental impacts. Weve also asked the EPA and KMCO for comment on the matter. We will update when they respond.
Since Monday, Corey Williams has installed several air quality monitors in Houston-area schools.

These incidents are awful, but for many of the residents who have to walk by these industrial facilities, its just another day in the life. Crosby, with a population just over 2,000, suffers from a poverty rate nearly twice that of the U.S. at large. The surrounding region sees an elevated cancer risk, according to the Environmental Protection Agencys 2014 National Air Toxics Assessment, from formaldehyde and ethylene oxide. And while its hard to know for sure what causes cancer in any individual, the KMCO Crosby Plant does have some history of emitting large amounts of ethylene oxide and formaldehyde into the air, according to the TCEQs records.
While authorities continue to investigate the fires cause, local residents have to try to return to normal. A shelter-in-place order lifted Tuesday night, so residents can leave their homes after a day of sheltering in place. But they have to be ready; they never know when the next fire will erupt.","Another day, another chemical plant fire. That’s the depressing reality in the Houston area.

David Murphy,"A large chunk of Apple’s audience is already lighting their bank accounts on fire in anticipation of all the neat new gear they can start preordering this week. That’s just the way it is, and partly why Apple can afford to do things like build sprawling, $200 buildings in the heart of Silicon Valley. No matter the price, or specifications, a lot of people are going to order one of the new iPhones: the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, or iPhone XS Max—a naming convention Apple totally didn’t borrow from that other company. You, however, are a reasonable Lifehacker reader who isn’t afraid to pay big bucks for sweet, geeky gear, but only if it provides a value and experience that’s greater than that which you already have. In other words, you don’t buy based on hype, and you don’t need an upgrade just because it’s new; you need an upgrade if it’s actually worth buying. Should you buy a new iPhone? Let’s explore: Key specs iPhone XR : 6.1-inch “Liquid Retina” LCD display; 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB storage; red, yellow, white, coral, black, and blue finishes; A12 Bionic chip; 12MP wide-angle camera; 7MP front-facing “TrueDepth” camera. Ranging from $749 to $899. iPhone XS : 5.8-inch OLED display; 64GB, 256GB or 512GB storage; gold, space gray, and silver finishes; A12 Bionic chip; 12MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras; 7MP front-facing “TrueDepth” camera. Ranging from $999 to $1,349. iPhone XS Max : 6.5-inch OLED display. Everything else the iPhone XS has. Ranging from $1,099 to $1,449. If you own an iPhone X... Congratulations: Your expensive smartphone lasted less time than the iPhone 8, as your relic is no longer purchasable from Apple... but the iPhone 8 (and even the iPhone 7) are still there. This makes sense, of course, since there’s absolutely no reason to buy an iPhone X with Apple dropping three new iPhones (two XSs and an XR) that basically take all the good things about the iPhone X and reconfigure them in different ways. If you upgrade—and I don’t think it makes sense to upgrade—you’re not getting all that much, hardware-wise. That’s not to say the A12 Bionic chip in the iPhone XS isn’t faster: Apple claims performance boosts of 15 percent for its two “performance” cores; a speed boost of 50 percent from its apple-design GPU; and a big, juicy brain an eight-core neural engine that can reach 5 trillion operations per second (more than eight times your device’s “meager” 600 billion operations per second). Let’s go beyond the specs sheet for a second. In everyday use, your iPhone X is probably fast enough for everything you need it to do. You probably aren’t using augmented reality very much. I’m sure your smartphone’s camera and photo processing feels pretty responsive. You might be a gamer, but even an iPhone at its best isn’t going to look as good as one of the many (cheaper) gaming devices out there, like a Nintendo Switch, a PlayStation Vita, a Nintendo 2DS or 3DS, et cetera. No matter how much Apple wants you to sweat with Kayla or fire up Pokemon Go (or any of its many clones), a device with more processing firepower than your current iPhone X won’t give you a better app experience save for the most extreme cases. Or, to put it another way, I’m still on an iPhone 8 Plus ( I know, I know ), and I have yet to use an app that makes me think, “Gosh, I probably need a faster iPhone. This is terrible.” If you’re a big photography nut—and Apple loves you, if so—the iPhone XS and XS Max aren’t coming out of the gate with a crazy-higher megapixel count for the wide-angle camera or telephoto cameras. There’s a new, larger sensor and improved TrueTone flash, but that’s probably not as monumental as the devices’ “Smart HDR” mode and, the big improvement, the ability to edit a photo’s depth of field after you’ve taken it. Would I drop $1,000 on that after already paying (at least) $1,000 for an iPhone X last year? No. Are the iPhone XS’ other improvements worth an expensive $1,000 upgrade? No. But you can probably sell your iPhone X for at least $500 or so right now from one of the many trade-in places (or eBay), so that helps soften the blow a bit. Generally speaking, though, I’d wait for next year’s iPhone upgrade—the non-”s” cycle—to really get your money’s worth. If you own an iPhone 8/8 Plus... This one gets a little trickier. I do love my Home button, I do, and I wish I could take Portrait Mode selfies. And while Apple has let other devices ( cough the “budget” iPhone XR cough ) have a software solution for Portrait Mode using a single camera, the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus is apparently too stupid to make it work. That, or Apple wants to give users every reason possible to upgrade. I suspect the latter. Trying to find the perfect iOS apps can be tough, and we’re willing to bet that your iPhone or iPad … Read more Read As before, my performance argument still stands—I have yet to have a poor enough of an app experience to make me yearn for a new iPhone. However, my iPhone 8 Plus is now two years old. The battery is reasonably fine, but the value of my iPhone will soon reach a point when I’ll get next to nothing for a trade in. I’d prefer to strike while the iron is lukewarm and at least get something reasonable for my device while I still can. I love the iPhone XS’ dimensions: The regular iPhone XS gives you more screen space than the iPhone 8 Plus (5.8 inches to 5.5 inches) in a smaller form factor. That’s appealing. And if you want to stick with iPhone 8 Plus’ gargantuan size, you get 6.5 inches of screen on the iPhone XS Max. That’s great, and it definitely has me eager to upgrade. Also, you get a much better-looking OLED screen, a higher pixel density, and all the photographic improvements previously mentioned—as well as optical image stabilization for your telephoto lens and a slightly faster lens (ƒ/2.4 versus ƒ/2.8). And don’t forget about animoji. Gotta have that talking poop. I will probably upgrade to a newer iPhone, because it seems like a reasonable upgrade, but I could make just as compelling an argument for keeping my device. If you’re on an iPhone 8, I’d recommend going for at least an iPhone XR—the camera features are interesting enough to warrant giving it a go, even though the iPhone itself is going to be larger than what you’re used to using (and you might not like that). It gives you reasonable access to performance, security, and speed improvements without forcing you to drop four figures on a new iPhone. The iPhone XS is an even better step up (obviously), but if you weren’t swayed by last year’s iPhone X, you probably aren’t going to be as convinced to pay that much for its improvements over the iPhone XR: an OLED “True Tone” display; a second, telephoto lens; a slightly smaller form factor; 3D Touch (get it while you can!); and more portrait lighting effects, to name a few. If you’re on an iPhone 8 Plus, like me, you’ll probably want to go iPhone XS at minimum. The iPhone XR feels like a slight step back from the iPhone 8 Plus, given the loss of the telephoto lens and a few Portrait Mode effects. The iPhone XS, in contrast, gives you a slightly larger (OLED) screen in a much smaller form factor, which feels like more of a noteworthy upgrade for its (admittedly higher) price. That’s in addition to all the other improvements all three iPhones share: the speedier A12 chip, dual-SIM capabilities ( if your carriers support it ), animoji, Depth Control (changing a photo’s depth of field after the fact), a bit more battery for your device (+1.5 hours for the iPhone XR versus the iPhone 8 Plus, and anywhere from an extra half an hour to an extra hour and a half for the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max versus the iPhone X). It’s that time again: time for your annual frantic search to find all of the original packaging for … Read more Read If you own an older iPhone... For whatever reason, you haven’t upgraded your iPhone in a while. And that’s OK! You don’t have to buy a new iPhone every year. You don’t even have to buy a new iPhone every other year. I’m going to assume that there’s some particular reason why you don’t upgrade, though—perhaps it’s too expensive. While I’d normally suggest to buy the best-possible device you can get (the iPhone XS or XS Max) so you’re covered for a few years, that $1,000 starting price is tough to look at. The iPhone XR is a great alternative for all the reasons I’ve previously mentioned—it feels like the best of the “budget” devices Apple now carries. I remember all the hubbub when Apple first announced Face ID back in September of 2017. There were… Read more Read That said, Apple is still offering both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 (in regular and Plus versions). I wouldn’t go iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, because those feel incredibly ancient (even if they’re cheap, now starting at a mere $449 for the iPhone 7 or $569 for the iPhone 7 Plus). The iPhone 8 feels like the sweet spot for me: $599 for the iPhone 8 or $699 for the iPhone 8 Plus. You’ll get wireless charging, a more durable glass back, 64GB of storage for the cheapest version of the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, a prettier “True Tone” display, 3D Touch (for as long as that lasts), Portrait Lighting effects (on the iPhone 8 Plus), support for 4K video at 30 and 60 fps, and higher-resolution slo-mo video. Some of these features are not the biggest deal, I realize, but I think the wireless charging and extra storage by themselves are worth the slight boost in price. At least, I’d rather have a 64GB iPhone 8 than a 128GB iPhone 7—especially with only a $50 gap between them. A 32GB iPhone 7 feels like it wouldn’t be enough for your apps, photos, and movies, whereas a 64GB iPhone 8 feels like the sweet spot, in my experience. We’re kicking Tech 911 up to “hard mode” this week—a little—because moving data from one smartphone … Read more Read If you don’t own an iPhone at all... The cheapest iPhone XS (64GB) costs $140 more than a 256GB Samsung Galaxy S9+, $350 more than the Google Pixel 2 (64GB), $370 more than the most tricked-out OnePlus 6 you can get (256GB), and $200 more than the gaming-themed Razer Phone (64GB). Welcome to the Apple ecosystem, Android fans. I can’t compare every device out there to Apple’s latest offerings, but know that you’ll probably be paying quite a few more pennies if you want the very best (or medium-best) Apple has to offer. If you’re used to the top-of-the-line smartphones from the big Android manufacturers, my guess is you’ll want to at least go for the iPhone XS—for its screen size, OLED display, camera, general performance, et cetera. The iPhone XR feels more like the “budget” version of Apple’s latest offerings, but I doubt you’ll want to try that, or the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7, if you’re used to having the latest and greatest. The iPhone XR is a good stopgap phone if you need to upgrade to something that’s decently better than your older device, and you don’t want to blow $1,000 to do it. Otherwise, if you’re coming from something like the Samsung Galaxy S9— you spender you —it’s iPhone XS all the way (or iPhone XS Max).","A large chunk of Apple’s audience is already lighting their bank accounts on fire in anticipation of all the neat new gear they can start preordering this week.

Andrew Freedman,"California's Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties has eclipsed the 2003 Cedar Fire as the largest wildfire in Golden State history, at a whopping 273,400 acres. This puts the blaze's burned area as larger than New York City, and nearly the equivalent of the sprawling city of Los Angeles. The fire has destroyed 1,063 structures and damaged 280 more. During the past week, firefighters have made significant gains, with the state reporting 78 percent containment as of early Sunday morning. The record size was eclipsed on Dec. 22, with additional growth possible before full containment is made sometime in early 2018.

In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fast-moving fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. The state is seeing a trend toward more damaging wildfire seasons, with 14 of the 20 largest blazes on record occurring since they year 2000. This is due to a combination of factors, from climate change to urban sprawl. Temperature departures from average during summer 2017 across the state of California. Image: noaa/ncei. The Thomas Fire, along with other blazes that erupted across the state during the late summer and fall, resulted from a combination of climate extremes that are becoming more common in the state as a result of global climate change. Repeated, record heat waves sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. Meanwhile, a large bulge, or ridge, in the jet stream has been steering Pacific storms away from California week after week, pushing the fire season deeper into the year. Computer model projections show virtually no precipitation falling in southern California during the next two weeks, for example. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this image of the Thomas Fire burn scar on Dec. 18, 2017.

As a result of these back-to-back extremes, thousands of California's trees have died, leaving them susceptible to toppling, taking power lines with them, during the typical Santa Ana and "" El Diablo "" wind events that struck during the fall and early winter. Both the wine country fires and Thomas Fire occurred during periods of these intense winds, and downed wires are a suspected cause of some of the blazes.

JULIA JACOBS,"On Thursday, Gov. Jerry Brown of California declared a state of emergency in Riverside County because of the Cranston fire. The declaration also applied to Shasta County, in Northern California, where a 20,000-acre fire is blazing. Lt. Eric Dickson, a spokesman for the Police Department in Hemet, Calif., a city west of Idyllwild, said the department’s officers found Mr. McGlover driving in his car after they were alerted to look out for a white Honda sedan that could be connected to the fires. In the vehicle, the authorities found possible fire accelerants, Lieutenant Dickson said. Mr. McGlover, who is from Temecula, Calif., a city southwest of Idyllwild, had his bail set at $1 million, the lieutenant said. As of Thursday afternoon, about 2,500 homes had been evacuated and nearly 700 responders were mobilized to contain the flames, Ms. Sieliet said. Winds were blowing the fire eastward and northeastward during the afternoon. Tony Allen, the owner of Bluebird Cottage Inn, which is nestled in the San Jacinto Mountains, said that he and 15 guests left the area on Wednesday as the fire was spreading northeast from its location about a mile south of his business. The fire destroyed five homes in the area, according to the Forest Service, but Mr. Allen said his inn was safe for now. “The houses there were just ash; there was not really anything left standing,” he said. “It was sort of surreal.”","The Cranston fire burning in San Bernardino National Forest on Thursday.

Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"The new fire ignited near the 405 Freeway in the Bel Air neighborhood, forcing the authorities to close the northbound lanes of the interstate, one of the major links between the bulk of the city and the San Fernando Valley. With Santa Ana winds whipping from the east, the blaze posed a risk of jumping across the highway, where it would threaten the Getty Center museum and the Brentwood neighborhood. To the north, in Ventura County, a fire that broke out on Monday and grew to 50,000 acres on Tuesday continued to burn unabated, and had destroyed at least 150 structures, state officials said — and possibly many more. Evacuation orders covering thousands of people were in effect for parts of the city of Ventura, and Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. Parts of the 101 Freeway, along with many smaller roads, were closed to traffic. California has seen some of its most destructive fires ever this year. In October, even as more than a dozen fires broke out in the northern part of the state, a separate one quickly grew in the Anaheim Hills, burning through thousands of acres.

Tom McKay,"Trump Tower, President Donald Trump’s midtown Manhattan skyscraper, caught on fire on Saturday. It is, as of yet, unclear how or why flames are engulfing the side of the 58-story building. But video posted to Twitter shows New Yorkers gathered to see flame shoot out one end of the tower, which just as quickly drew a strong New York Fire Department response. At one point, flaming debris appeared to explode out of windows and fall to the ground. Though initial indications were that no injuries were reported, the FDNY later tweeted that at least one civilian sustained a “serious injury.” Per CBS, the FDNY also said four firefighters sustained minor injuries. Trump tweeted at 6:42pm ET thanking firefighters and reassuring the public that the fire was “out” and “very confined (well built building).” AP photos showed firefighters on scene and looking out the building’s shattered windows, the blaze apparently extinguished. It’s the second time this year that Trump Tower has caught on fire. In January, vents on the roof burst into flame after an electrical issue, resulting in at least three injures, though the FDNY referred to the situation as “quick, easy, and routine.” This is a breaking news story and may be updated as more information becomes available.","Trump Tower, President Donald Trump’s midtown Manhattan skyscraper, caught on fire on Saturday.

Tom Warren,"HP has created a set of gaming headphones that are designed to cool your ears down. While your fingers are likely to tire before your eats set on fire, gaming on a PC for hours can be an uncomfortable experience, especially during the summer time. HP’s new Omen Mineframe Headset is the first to feature active earcup cooling by using thermoelectric magnets to cool your ears. I briefly tried HP’s headset at Gamescom this week and it’s definitely a unique and slightly odd experience. You push the two earcups towards your ears to experience what I can only describe as a cool tingling feeling. It’s a strange sensation, but even in the brief few minutes I was wearing the headset it did feel slightly cooler. I’d have to test it for hours to really see if it makes any difference while gaming. I did notice the inside of the cups feel very cool to touch, but the outside heats up as the headset cools the insides. The ear cups also light up, and they’re powered over USB so it’s unlikely HP will create a battery-powered version. HP says it has patented this new headphone cooling, and the company avoided using fans to ensure there was no additional noise. HP has also added noise cancellation to the headset, and real-time audible feedback with fabric cups to improve breathability.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26. And for good reason: Fire tornados are among the rarest weather phenomena on Earth, and this vortex had the added distinction of possibly being the strongest tornado-like thing in California’s history. But more interesting than what we know about the wild-sounding event is what we don’t. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther there have been references to fire tornados since the 19th century, but only one other such event has been well-documented to date. Consequently, we have only a basic understanding of how and why fire tornadoes form. We know a lot more about their garden-variety cousins, fire whirls, which form by the dozens on wildfire fronts. (A rather spectacular one was captured by firefighters battling a blaze near Derbyshire, England on Tuesday.) Similar to dust devils, these whirls develop when turbulent, rotating air gets stretched vertically by an updraft. They only last a few minutes, and top out at about 150 feet in height, according to Weather Underground meteorologist and blogger Bob Henson, who penned a detailed explainer about the recent fire vortex. “They’re basically wind shear that gets tilted up,” Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, told Earther. A fire tornado shares some features with a fire whirl but quite literally takes things to new heights. These rotating columns of air are, by definition, connected both to a cloud system above and the ground below. So-called pyrocumulous clouds (and pyrocumulonimbus thunderclouds) form as hot air rises above a wildfire’s smoke plume, cools, and condenses, creating the potential for a tornado to form. But these clouds typically only emerge at high altitudes due to the intense heat of the flames. What that means is that any vortex connected to both a fire-generated cloud system and the ground is going to be big. According to Clements, the one that formed inside the Carr Fire on the evening of July 26 was associated with a pyrocumulonimbus system that extended tens of thousands of feet up into the stratosphere. Exactly how the tornado-like vortex spun up is still being worked out, and we may never be totally sure. University of Nevada Reno atmospheric scientist Neil Lareau put together an analysis based on Doppler radar data that suggests it formed like a landspout tornado, with an area of horizontal wind shear near the ground getting stretched vertically by a powerful updraft, and eventually connecting with the cloud system above. Others have described the firenado’s formation as similar to that of a more powerful supercell tornado, which are generated by rotating updrafts within thunderstorms. Henson told Earther he thought the vortex could have had elements of both supercell and landspout tornado. “This is definitely about as strong as you’d expect a landspout-type tornado to get,” Henson said. “That’s why it feels like a hybrid to me.” Either way, the vortex was a beast. A preliminary analysis by National Weather Service and CalFire estimated maximum wind-speeds in excess of 143 mph, making it the equivalent of an EF-3 on an intensity scale of 0-5. The twister lasted over an hour, toppling power lines and uprooting trees. To some, the freak event felt like an harbinger of a hotter, more dangerous future. But while climate change is having a clear impact on fire season, connections to rare fire tornado events are more tenuous. As Clements put it, “if it was just climate and fuel driving tornados, every fire would have a tornado.” He suspects that fire tornados come from some combination of loads of vegetation fuel—which generates the intense heat needed to create powerful updrafts—and the right topography. In the case of the very large, very intense Carr Fire (which is still only about 50 percent contained ), air flows racing through gaps in the mountains near Redding in the late afternoon on July 26 might have provided the necessary wind shear to set things off. Clearly, there are a lot of unanswered questions. But future research could help fill in the gaps. Clements’ group uses a mobile weather lab —a 4x4 pickup truck outfitted with a scanning Doppler LIDAR instrument, weather balloon sounding system, and a portable meteorological station—to study fire weather up close. The system has revealed never-before-seen structures inside wildfire plumes and offered insight how pyrocumulous clouds form. And it’s getting an upgrade this fall, with the addition of a Doppler radar-equipped pickup truck that will allow them to detect plumes from farther away and at a higher resolution.

At least 64 people died in the blaze on Sunday, 41 of them children. Relatives say dozens of people are still missing. Wednesday has been declared a day of national mourning, and vigils have been held across Russia. Thousands of people protested in Kemerovo on Tuesday amid anger over alleged safety failings at the leisure complex where the fire broke out. Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits blocked, and President Putin - who visited Kemerovo on Tuesday - has blamed ""criminal negligence"" for the blaze. Five people have been arrested in connection with the fire. Wednesday's funerals included those of a grandmother and two children. Mourners lit candles and laid flowers and toys. One message read: ""Children, forgive us"". A priest told those gathered: ""This tragedy is made worse by the fact that children became victims of the blaze.

Darrell Etherington,"SpaceX has successfully test fired its Falcon Heavy rocket – but this is just the prelude to the big show. The static test fire performed today is a necessary step prior to an actual test launch, firing up all 27 of the rocket’s big Merlin engines prior to trying to do the same but actually following through with a proper take-off. The test fire, completed at the SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch facility from which Falcon Heavy will make its first voyage, occurred early Wednesday afternoon, and SpaceX signalled following the test that all went well. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk then revealed that because of the good firing of the engines, it’s now on track for launch within the next “week or so.” That’s great news, because the test launch was already postponed from late last year, and then it looked like it might be even more delayed owing to the government shutdown, which affected SpaceX’s ability to launch from Cape Canaveral. The shutdown has been suspended, at least temporarily, and that means it’s now time to get back to launch activities – including the inaugural flight of SpaceX’s really big rocket. With Falcon Heavy, SpaceX hopes to be able to launch heavier payloads, servicing more clients and potentially rolling multiple missions together for more economical operation. Falcon Heavy has nearly three times the load capacity of the Falcon 9, and is a crucial component in SpaceX’s plan to eventually fly crewed operations and make it to Mars.","SpaceX has successfully test fired its Falcon Heavy rocket – but this is just the prelude to the big show.

Darrell Etherington,"SpaceX is planning to perform a static test fire of its massive Falcon Heavy rocket later this week, the company revealed today in a statement from company President and COO Gwynne Shotwell. Now that the rocket is vertical on launchpad LC-39A, a static test fire to ensure the rocket’s 27 Merlin engines are in good working order and ready for the full, inaugural test launch targeting low Earth orbit shortly thereafter. The fact that SpaceX is ready to test fire its heavy-duty rocket means it’s likely getting very close to launch – it could be ready to go within the next couple of weeks. That’s in keeping with what SpaceX has been saying since late last year, when it pushed the initial test launch from the end of 2017 to sometime in the very beginning of 2018. SpaceX first showed Falcon Heavy vertical at Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 3, just days into the new year. It’s carrying a special payload, too – an original Tesla Roadster in cherry red, which SpaceX is hoping to put into an extended orbit of Mars if everything goes exactly to plan with the initial Falcon Heavy launch. Everything going to plan isn’t necessarily a lock, of course. Tesla hasn’t ever attempted to launch a rocket with this much thrust before, and real-world experience never fails to differ from expectations, simulations and projections. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has suggested in the past that it’s possible the rocket will explode long before it reaches orbit, but that such a result would represent a success of sorts since it’ll provide crucial data to inform future attempts.","SpaceX is planning to perform a static test fire of its massive Falcon Heavy rocket later this week, the company revealed today in a statement from company President and COO Gwynne Shotwell.

MICHAEL LEWIS,"The Library Book is indeed an entire book about a library. The surprise is that the library, though insistently undramatic, has been, pretty much since its inception, so insistently attractive to interesting characters. Charles Fletcher Lummis is here just a case in point. The Los Angeles Public Library had opened in 1873. Women were forbidden from the main reading room at first but by 1885, when Lummis arrived in Los Angeles from the Midwest, women were running the place. Until then hed been a newspaper reporter with a talent for attracting attention to himself hed walked from Ohio to California in knickers and tomato-red knee socks, and written columns about it along the way. Arriving in Los Angeles, he wrote that it was a dull little place of some 12,000 persons and then proceeded to make it a lot less dull. He built a private pleasure palace, employed a family of troubadours, threw the best parties in town and, despite being married, slept with seemingly every woman he met. Lummiss life wasnt on a course that would lead naturally to becoming a librarian, Orlean writes, and yet a librarian he became. The librarys board of directors, deciding it wanted a man to run the place, fired the competent woman then in charge, and replaced her with Lummis. Right away Lummis set out to improve the tastes of the citizens of Los Angeles. He paid a blacksmith to create an iron with a skull and crossbones brand, which he stamped into the frontispiece of pseudoscience books. He then had the library create warning labels to paste into the books his original plan was to include text that read: This book is of the worst class that we can possibly keep in the library. We are sorry that you have not any better sense than to read it. (He was ultimately persuaded to tone it down.) He promoted the library as he promoted himself and aimed to make it a workshop for scholars including every painters apprentice or working boy or streetcar man who wishes to learn, just as much as it includes the Greek professors or the art dilettante. He trained his assistants to be aggressively useful, and explained to all that books are the last things that any human being can afford to do without. At the same time he was in many ways indefensible, as the face of the public library. He continued to have sex with every woman he met. One of his troubadours murdered one of his housekeepers. Eventually after having exerted enormous influence on the library he was fired, whereupon he penned an angry letter to a friend. You will remember I was not a Sweet Girl Graduate of a Library School, he wrote. I was a Scholar and Frontiersman and a Two-fisted He-Person and that I went to the roots of that Sissy Library and made it, within two years, an Institution of Character, a He-Library, of which we were all proud. Anyway, you get the idea. Susan Orlean has once again found rich material where no one else has bothered to look for it. Her book is less a straightforward story than an exercise in mining her intense feelings for a subject. Once again, shes demonstrated that the feelings of a writer, if that writer is sufficiently talented and her feelings sufficiently strong, can supply her own drama. You really never know how seriously interesting a subject might be until such a person takes a serious interest in it.",Susan Orlean’s “The Library Book” is an absorbing account of the 1986 fire that devastated the Los Angeles Central Library and a homage to libraries everywhere.,2018-10-15T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Nonfiction: The Library Fire That Ignited an Author’s Imagination,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/books/review/susan-orlean-library-book.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/21/books/review/21Lewis-COVER/21Lewis-COVER-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fire,1
David Murphy,"Wifi extenders. Secondhand CPUs. A piece of crap Kindle Fire. Lifehacker readers are generally smart and astute, thanks in part to the buffet of productivity tips they feast upon every week. Even the best of us makes mistakes, though. 
My tech regret for 2018 is simple: I bought an SNES Classic. Dont get me wrong. I think The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is one of the finest video games ever created, and that will never change. However, I had this weird premonition when purchasing itafter a beeline run to the local Target when I saw they had a few in stockthat I would probably play the console for a week, think happy thoughts about my childhood, and let it collect dust.
I was right.
Lifehacker readers had a few blunders this year, too. We asked you to share your stories of tech regret last week, and here are some of some of our favorites. May 2019 be ever in your technological favor.
Wifi extenders arent always that helpful
Not buying a better router. I have the crappy Spectrum one that was included with our service and the range feels like its only good for roughly 25ft. Barely reaches upstairs. I bought a WiFi extender but the signal barely reaches that. Any one have a suggestion for a decently priced router?
Lifehacker reader Yes I drive a 240... Sort of made the mistake of going for a wifi extender that, sadly, didnt do very much to help his wireless issues. Without getting into the weeds, basic extenders are generally garbage for a few reasons: You dont get that much extra range, since you need to position it well within your wifi routers bubble for the best possible speeds. After that, your wifi performance with an extender might get cut in half anyway, since the extender has to do double-dutyrelaying the same data back and forth to your router and your connected device. A dual-band extender can help with this, but youre still better off getting a higher-performing router. Better yet, pick up a mesh system that uses a high-speed (5GHz) dedicated wifi backhaul. Or wire your house with Ethernet and set up a bunch of access points. The possibilities are many.
With smartwatches, try before you buy
I asked for and received an apple watch for my birthday. I wanted one because the commercials made them out to look really cool. 2 weeks in now and I dont really know what the apple watch is good for. I even attended the apple watch basics at the apple store to learn more about the available features. But it seems its biggest, most promoted feature is being able to switch the face gallery and reminding me to breathe. Its now just a $300 piece of thing sitting on my wrist. Im trying to figure out how long I have to keep it (as to not upset the gift givers) before I can sell it.
Lifehacker reader Heyhowareyouall bemoans his new Apple Watch. I get it, I do. I had an Apple Watch a long time ago (first-generation, I believe), and then I sold it, and then it was years before I convinced myself I ever needed another smartwatchfor the exact same reasons youre describing. I find most smartwatch apps terrible, at best, and I mostly use my smartwatchs features for fitness. If im not working out, its an expensive timepiece that I can also use to control my podcasts on my iPhone if Im feeling lazy.
I dont really have any good suggestions for this one, other than to be mindful of Apples 14-day return policy for hardware. Two weeks should be enough time for you to tell if you like or hate a new, expensive purchase (or gift).
The same advice goes for you, Lifehacker reader tulleytwo, who let us know that their biggest regret was Homepod. I bought one because I thought it would be useful. It isnt and my wife reminds me of that every time I want to buy another tech toy.
Maybe virtual reality isnt the greatest thing ever after all
I was going to say the iPhone SE I just bought in November (hate large phones), but, in spite of the $450 I spent on an obsolete phone, the $225 I spent on the Oculus Go I regret far more. It has a mediocre screen, an awful controller, terribly annoying interface, is uncomfortable, and there is nothing to actually DO on the thing other than watch 4 minute demo videos that are supposed to make you feel like the future. 
For the sake of an article Im working on right now, Im not going to say that virtual reality is terrible. However, having spent a good amount of time with a number of the major headsets, its fair to say that virtual reality is still in its infancy. And this comment from Lifehacker reader Osmodious really nails the problem.
Headsets are bulky and annoying to wear after a decent period of time, and the image cant compete with what youd get from a decent monitor or awesome gaming display. Most of the reason for buying a virtual reality headset right now is gaming. You can still have some super-fun experiences, dont get me wrong, but I think Id rather save up for a sweet display or GPU upgrade than a headset that feels fun at first, but doesnt seem like the kind of thing youd use on a regular basis.
Hop back in your time machine
I bought a CueCat.
Technically, Lifehacker reader Ron Mexico Will Pay for the Wall didnt buy a CueCat in 2018I hopesince this weird barcode-scanning device came out in 2000. The idea was that you would use this weirdly shaped device to scan codes that would then take you to websites. Because, you know, we all need some hardware gadget instead of a simple text hyperlink. Maybe it would have had some traction if looked more serious than this:
Hacking your purchases to get what you want
I purchased a rocketship System 76 Oryx Pro laptop to be my primary laptop. I opted for all the bells and whistles, including a 4k display. (I really dislike System 76's Pop OS) Well it turns out that most Linux distributions dont play well with the 4k display, and the battery life ranges from between 1 and 2 hours, depending on usage. The power brick is roughly the size of an actual brick. Im not unhappy with the machine (great performance) but it wasnt what I needed for the purpose I had intended for it. So I bought a sub-$300 Chromebook, hacked it to run Linux natively (not via crouton) and its now my daily driver with more than 9 hours of battery life. (Both laptops run the same version of Linux.)
I have never heard of the System 76 Oryx Pro, let alone System 76. (I presume thats not related to the Overwatch character.) And while I also dont know much about installing Linux distrosnever my thing, unfortunatelyI commend Lifehacker reader Douglas for taking the time to figure out a solution and hacking your way through a standard piece of hardware to get the exact results you want. For space, I cut out the part of your response about what you did with your laptop-that-didnt-work, but its intriguing that youre planning to use it as a daily desktop driver now. Report back if you manage to get five monitors hooked up. Id love to see what that looks like... and if your laptop bursts into flames after one hour of gaming on that awesome-sounding setup.
How long should you wait to buy something you really want?
My biggest tech regret was not on the item itself but more on the price. So I bought a Crucial SSD a few months ago. I thought I got a good price for $98, since it usually sold for around $120. But then its price kept falling; last time I check it was $68 or something. Had I waited a bit, I wouldve saved even more But all things considered, I was happy with the purchase. Ive known the risk that with tech purchases, there would always a better price around the corner. 
Ah, I know this game well. Im always looking for that next big upgrade, but I hesitate to pull the trigger because even a decent-sounding deal now could be eclipsed by an awesome deal laterwhich is why I invariably make all my big tech purchases around Black Friday. That tends to save me the most money, even though it means Im only allowing myself to buy new gear in a very tiny window of time. 
That said, you shouldnt feel bad, Lifehacker reader JoshTheBat! You saved some money, which is better than not saving any money at all. And as far as upgrades go, replacing a mechanical hard drive with an SSDIm assuming thats what you didis the kind of upgrade that youll immediately notice. Sure, you could have saved a little extra cash if you waited, but you would have had to suffer a slower experience for more weeks/months.
Maybe you should wait before buying some tech gear
No question buying a Pixel 3 XL at launch. I love the phone and camera, just the launch experience felt like a price gouge within weeks of purchase. I was a little dismayed at the paltry specs for a ~$1000 phone at launch, but accepted that maybe this is our new tech reality with Apple being the price setter. But seeing 2 for 1 discounts and $200-400 discounts by the time Black Friday rolled around just proved that the price point for Google isnt reflective of the hardware and cost reality, but is just a Google tax (much like the Apple Tax) in order to have their premier phone with the most-up-to-date Google software experience. I ended up buying a Pixel 3 for $400 on Black Friday for my wife at a near 50% discount from the release price of a few weeks earlier.
Second verse, same as the first. (This time, starring Lifehacker reader gabesaves).
When it comes to smartphones, specifically, Im always of the opinion that its better to wait a little bitif you canbecause you never know what kind of deal youll get once the launch excitement dissipates. Heck, even Apple thew down some pretty decent deals this year for the new iPhone XS and XR, assuming you traded in an older iPhone to get one. You would have had to wait 1-2 months past launch to get them, sure, but if you can suffer an older iPhone for slightly longer, you could have saved a few hundred bucks in total.
With both the Pixels and iPhones typically arriving in the fall, Id say its at least worth it to wait until the insane Black Friday shopping time to make a big new smartphone purchase. Thats usually only a month or so, and thats one of your best opportunities to score a new phone for a lower price. Or, as Lifehacker reader Camelot puts it:
Never ever buy a phone on launch :) Theyre counting on the hype to boost profits (Apple is a master of this). Wait ~6 months to almost before they launch the next version. Youll save a ton of cash. Your phone wont be outdated a year after anyway.
Real dog &gt; Robot
Anki cosmo and Anki vector. Kids play with it for a while and then realize their dog is far more interesting. These expensive robots just have a few cute tricks and thats it. 
Well, yeah. I couldnt agree with your kids more, Lifehacker reader Retrobanana. A real dog is a lot more fun than some funky little robot thats limited to a few interactionsor even a few hundred interactions. At some point, the novelty factor wears off. And given how kids probably have their obsessions already stamped into their tiny brains (Fortnite, anyone?), even a shiny new robot toy isnt probably going to hold their attention for long versus the tech toys (or family pets) they already love.
Maybe you could introduce the Anki Cosmo or Vector to your pet? 
A smartphone owners worst nightmare

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"""Uncle's house is on fire, pray for him!"" On the other end of the phone, in a small village in North Eastern Bangladesh, Kamru Miah's eldest son Suzon can do little else. Powerless to help and 5,000 miles away, he gets to his knees. A short time later, he would be praying for his father's soul. ­­­ The tower block fire in west London on 14 June, 2017, left 72 people dead and destroyed the lives of hundreds of others. As the flames from a small fridge fire on the fourth floor grew into the UK's worst fire since the wartime Blitz, the effects began to be felt around the world. It soon became clear that this was no ordinary fire; not least because the tower's diverse community meant that Grenfell was, and still is, an international disaster. Many of the building's residents had loved ones around the globe. There were families who perished with links to Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Italy, Iran, Ireland, Lebanon, Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sudan, Syria and Trinidad. We have been to meet some of those left behind. Kamru Miah - Bangladesh Kamru Miah was 79 years old. He moved to the UK from Bangladesh in 1963, aged 26, and worked his way up from his first job as a baker's assistant to eventually becoming a talented chef. Kamru died after becoming trapped in his home on the 17th floor of Grenfell Tower - along with his second wife Rabeya Begum, his sons Mohammed Hamid and Mohammed Hanif and his daughter Husna ""Tanima"" Begum. His eldest son in London, Mohammed Hakim, had moved out of the family home. As the harrowing details of the family's last desperate phone calls from the burning block began to emerge - a telephone would also ring almost 5,000 miles away in the remote Bangladeshi village of Khoilshaura. Media caption Grieving relatives in Bangladesh of Kamru Miah who died in Grenfell Kamru Miah's first wife Jolika Bibi was at home with her son Suzon. Suzon had just returned from a mosque nearby and was heading to bed when he answered a call from his cousin in London, Abdul Rahim. ""Uncle's house is on fire, pray for him!"" he told him. A short time later, that phone would ring again, this time with devastating news. ""Just pray for your father now, there is no hope,"" he told him. Suzon said his cousin also described how his stepsister had called from the bathroom, fully aware of her fate, asking for prayers. She was trapped with her mother. She told her loved ones: ""This is our voice, we will not speak again."" All hope was lost. Since Kamru's death, his wife Jolika's health has deteriorated. She says that as well as the trauma of losing him, there are huge practical repercussions for the family. ""He used to send money for me, now I'm helpless. I'm an old woman, I need medicine, my son buys it for me but I know it is becoming a burden for him. ""Kamru promised me we'd go to the Hajj Pilgrimage together, but it won't happen now."" Image caption Suzon and his mother in Bangladesh Kamru's elder daughter Mina lives near the family home with her husband. She and her father Kamru had a special relationship. She wept uncontrollably as she remembered the man who was her hero. ""I was my father's favourite. I was his world. He fed me with his own hand when he came to Bangladesh last time. It won't ever happen again. ""We took some pictures together the last time he was with us. But I never thought it was our last meeting. If I'd known I would have tried to capture every footstep he took."" For Kamru's eldest son, the burden of suddenly being the main breadwinner for his mother and his family weighs heavy. ""My father used to visit Bangladesh every other year. He always brought clothes for us and chocolate for his grandchild. ""He always sent money to us, without this we would never have built this house."" Suzon says he is now barely surviving with what little he makes from his farm but the biggest hardship he is facing, is not being able to say goodbye to his beloved father. ""I desperately want to see my father's grave, and the place where he died. This may bring peace to my mind. Now that it's the first anniversary we have organised a prayer ceremony at our mosque, we will feed the poor."" Rania Ibrahim - Egypt At 01:40 on 14 June 2017, Rania Ibrahim looks out of her 23rd-storey flat and streams what she sees live on Facebook. It is the only footage that has emerged from inside Grenfell Tower that night. A group of people gathered in her home. Within hours, they will all be dead. Amongst them, Rania's young daughters Fathia, five, and Hania, aged three. As Rania broadcast her last moments to the world, watching the news in horror in southern Egypt was her sister Randa. ""I couldn't believe it when I first saw the Grenfell Tower fire. It was a massive shock for me. The scene was horrific. I broke down in tears and began screaming hysterically as soon as I saw it."" ""I know that my sister was living on the top floor. My brother told me Rania was on the phone with him until she said that the fire had reached her apartment - and those were her last words. Rania was 30 years old and had been in the UK since 2009. He husband Hassan Awad was in Cairo at the time of the fire. He lost his everything, his wife, his daughters and his home. Randa says losing Rania has left a huge void in all their lives. ""She used to visit us every year. The whole family used to gather whenever Rania was here. She was very generous and every time she came she brought us all presents. ""She was full of life and used to laugh all the time. She was so adorable. Rania was so kind and loveable. She was beautiful inside and out."" Media caption Randa Ibrahim remembers her sister Rania who died in the Grenfell Tower fire Rania moved to the UK with her elder sister Saida to study law. For her family in Egypt, the fact that such a catastrophe could happen in London is still difficult to accept. ""She wanted to live. She uploaded a video on Facebook begging for help. Why wasn't she rescued? How would a big country like the UK leave her to die like this? Didn't they have helicopters or any rescue methods to save the residents of the tower?"" The family says it took three months for Rania's remains to be identified. Three months during which the family couldn't help but have hope, where in truth, there was none. ""I know a year has passed now but I still don't believe that Rania is gone. I imagine her calling or coming soon with her usual beautiful smile shouting ""I'm back"" as she always used to do."" Choukair family - Lebanon Bassem Choukair was 40 when he died in the fire on the night of the 14 June. His wife Nadia, 33, her mother Sirria, 60, and his three daughters; Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab, three, all died with him. Three generations of one family lost in a single night. For Bassem's parents in Lebanon, the enormity of their loss is hard to process. Bassem's father Taan says the pain is unbearable. ""If he had died by God's will, I would say God took him. That's God's will. But burned? Burned? It's forced. He is burned against his will,"" he said. Bassem came to England from Lebanon 17 years ago. He married Nadia and his dream was to give his girls a good start in life. Speaking at the family home, his mother Bader speaks of her utter sense of loss and grief. ""My son was the sweetest young man in the world, the sweetest young man in the world. He was kind to us. He was the best. He would visit us every summer to check on us and see what we need. He was the best. ""He used to love my cooking 'Mum, cook me this and cook me that. I'd say ""Always for you my son"" but now he's gone."" As the inferno griped the tower, Bader was watching, with no idea that her son and his family were inside. ""We didn't know. I woke up in the morning. I turned on the TV to watch the news as usual. They were saying that a tower was on fire in London, and it was obvious how the fire was burning, but I didn't think that my son was in that same building. ""It was two hours later that I was told that my son was living there. And I lost my mind."" Media caption Grieving parents in Lebanon of Bassem Choukair who died in Grenfell Bassem's sister and her husband also live in London. They spent four days searching for the family, checking hospitals, refusing to give up hope. Bader was in touch with them throughout. ""My son-in-law knew they had died, that they were gone, but he'd say, ""No, I don't want anybody to say they're dead."" He'd get upset at anyone telling him may they rest in peace. ""He'd say, ""No, they're still alive."" He kept hoping till the end that they're alive. But there was no hope. They were gone."" For Bassem's father Taan, the shock of losing his son is still with him, along with an overwhelming sense of helplessness. ""I keep remembering him. Every time I pray, I remember him. I think of him and I start crying. What can I do? I swear, if I could die instead of him, I would die."" The family's remains were brought home to Lebanon to be buried nearby. Bader says she visits them and prays for them every Friday. ""I sit near the grave, I cry and scream, and no one answers me… everything has changed. There's no point to life anymore at all. No day passes without me crying and remembering him. ""I stayed in touch with him over WhatsApp. Every night, every night, every night, I would talk with him. Now there's no-one left to talk to me.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco California's deadliest current wildfire is getting larger, officials warn, despite thousands of firefighters battling it. ""Erratic winds"" and dry conditions have caused the Carr fire to grow early on Sunday, firefighters said. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its path as they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday. A fourth body was found on Sunday. Two firefighters also lost their lives on Thursday. A third firefighter died battling the Ferguson fire, near Yosemite, earlier this month. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years The Carr fire, which doubled in size overnight on Friday, was only 5% contained by Sunday morning. It has already burnt more than 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land and destroyed at least 500 structures. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River, according to news agency Reuters. California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 12,000 firefighters working to contain blazes across California ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest of eight big fires burning in California, and 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However, experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

Andrew Liptak,"Over the years, author John Scalzi has made a name for himself with his military science fiction Old Man’s War series, but when he kicked off a decade-long, multimillion-dollar contract with his publisher, he decided to start with a space opera novel set in a brand-new world. In The Collapsing Empire, humanity has spread across the galaxy, connected by an extra-dimensional phenomenon called the Flow. Ships can enter at various points and jet to another planet. A vast empire called the Interdependency has grown, ruling over the network of human colonies. But the Flow is beginning to shift, and The Collapsing Empire follows three characters dealing with the impending collapse and upheaval that will follow. In the next installment of the series, The Consuming Fire, the Interdependency’s leader, Emperox Grayland II, is forced to prepare for the impending collapse of her empire, but she must fight against factions in her government who believe the collapse is a myth or see the coming chaos as a way to gain power for themselves. We have the cover of the novel to show off, and I had the chance to chat with Scalzi about what to expect when the book hits stores on October 16th. Image: Sparth / Tor Books This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. W here you left off on The Collapsing Empire, t he Flow has begun to collapse, leaving some worlds stranded. So where does The Consuming Empire pick up? It’s going to take place not too far in future from where things end with The Collapsing Empire, and part of that is due to the fact that there are some things that we need to cover that have been suggested, like the collapse of particular flow streams, and we want to see some immediate aftereffects of that. I also left The Collapsing Empire on a bit of a cliffhanger, and if I don’t resolve that particular cliffhanger fairly quickly, I believe I will be stabbed to death by former fans. Emprox Grayland II is presiding over over this large empire as this collapse is happening. How is this going to challenge her as she tries to hold things together? Or is she going to try and rebuild in a new way? She is convinced by the information that she’s gotten from Marce Claremont, that in fact we’ve come to a point where the Flow streams are going to collapse and systems are going to be isolated. Her question now is how does she use her politically, religiously, and culturally to prepare people? She’s already convinced that the collapse is in process. So she’s already come to a point where she knows that the current setup is coming to the end. How does she use her power to mitigate what would otherwise be a hard crash? Because that’s the nature of human, to just deny, deny, deny, deny, deny until they absolutely don’t have a choice in the matter anymore, and she feels that. I think she feels that it’s her mission to get through the denial phase so that they can do something before it’s too late for everybody. I remember part of the analogy you used was as if the world’s ocean currents just vanished during a time when we were dependent upon them for trade, but it’s impossible to not think about the arguments on the validity of climate change. I don’t know that it’s so much that I’m taking it one for one with the “debate” on climate change — and let’s be clear that there really is no debate. There is science, and then there are a bunch of idiots denying it. But I think what we’re seeing with climate change is the same dynamic we see every time there’s a major issue that impinges on economics in the way of life: deny, deny, deny as long as humanly possible because nobody wants change or disruption. The thing about climate change or the “debate” about it is the same dynamic as it could be about tobacco usage. The fact of the matter is that there really is no debate: there is the overwhelming scientific evidence, and then there are people who are desperately trying to deny the facts so that they can get as much as they can out of the system before the change has to happen. What we’re seeing with climate change is just another example of really kind of a well-known rhetorical and political trope. In that respect, and certainly with what’s going on with the “climate debate” informs what I’m doing in terms of writing the book, but at the same time, that debate is not new. How does The Consuming Fire advance some of these arguments? I don’t know that they necessarily will advance them. Without getting into any particular spoilers, as the book continues, it’s going to be obvious that some of the things that Marce and the Emprox have been talking about are going to start happening: you’re going to see some of the Flow streams collapse — we saw that at the end of the last book — and they will happen reasonably close to what’s been predicted. What will be interesting is not whether the events will conform to the predictions that are based on scientific observation, but how people respond to that. If you get back to the idea of climate change, the issue is not whether or not people accept that there is climate change, right? Because the flooding, the weird weather, the huge differentiations in temperature: they’re all there. The argument is shifting from “no, climate change isn’t happening” to “climate change is obviously happening, but we don’t know if humans are responsible.” It’s a slow retreat by trying to avoid culpability, and by avoiding culpability, avoiding actual action. But the thing is: when Houston is flooding, if you’re standing there going “well, this is just because of natural processes,” it doesn’t change the fact that billions of dollars of damage is occurring. So I think what we’re going to see is a series of things that people recognize that in fact a collapse of Flow streams is happening, but the denial will be that this isn’t as bad as it seems, or maybe there’s an opportunity. We will see people go through the stages of denial, bargaining, anger, with respect to the fact that their way of life is ending and people will still have concerns like, “Oh sure, this isn’t going to happen in 10 years, but in a two-year time frame, I really need to scoop up all this money,” without thinking about the long-term when the collapse finally happens. Is there anything that’s surprising you about this book as you’re writing it? From a practical point of view, it’s not been surprising. I just write a whole bunch. I think about it, write some more the next day. But I will say that, without revealing any spoilers, the book goes places — physical places — within the universe that when I initially started thinking about the book, I really had no plans to go to. But through the development of thinking about the book and listening to what other people who read The Collapsing Empire thought about it, it gave me some ideas for some interesting plot developments that I wouldn’t have considered before. But again, the magic of not necessarily doing a whole lot of outlining to begin with: you get a lot of pleasant surprises. When it doesn’t go well, you have 3,000 words you can’t use, and then you panic. But fortunately, I’m not there yet. You told us last year that this was a duology, but that there was the possibility of a third book. How did you come to expand it to another installment? What happened was the book and its sequel were part of the overall Tor deal for 13 books over 10 years. When I did that, each of the books I presented had a synopsis and where I expected it to go. Just as they say that no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, no 13-book synopsis can survive first contact with actually having to write them. In this particular instance, while writing The Collapsing Empire, I realize that the story I was telling was not designed to be compact enough to fit into a 100,000-word novel. I wasn’t too worried about that because I had two books, even though the second book was originally planned to be radically different. Then, what the second book would eventually become, I was thinking that I could still tell the story over the course of two books, but as the world-building progressed, it became clear that three books would be the magic number. Now the thing is that one has to be very careful about over-expanding and just going into fiddly details, and two books becomes three books, becomes eight books. The first book is called The Collapsing Empire, and the empire is in fact going to collapse; it’s just a clever title. We have a natural narrative limit for this particular universe. I’m not worried about it going on indefinitely. But at the same time, the first book did very well; people really like what’s going on, and as a writer, I’ve found that there are narrative threads that I want to pursue that I’m not going to get to in the space of one particular novel. To give readers the satisfying reading experience they want, you want to make it feel like a complete narrative. Is there anything that you’re really excited for readers to get to, like scenes or characters that you’re having fun with? Yes! Happy smiley face emoji so-and-so forth. I’m obviously not going to talk about much now. Now I will say the first chapter of The Collapsing Empire was bit of a set up to explain the concept of the Flow, and involved a ship and a captain that we didn’t necessarily spend a lot of time with in the rest of the book. The first chapter of The Consuming Fire is somewhat similar to that.","John Scalzi talks about his next novel, The Consuming Fire, and how it’s about human tendencies to ignore major problems until it’s too late.

AHMED ABU RATIMA,"What has happened since we started the Great Return March is both what I hoped and expected — and not. It was not a surprise that Israel responded to our march with deadly violence. But I had not expected this level of cruelty. On the other hand, I was heartened by the commitment to nonviolence among most of my own people. A couple of years ago, people here would have dismissed the idea that peaceful demonstrations could achieve anything significant. After all, every other form of resistance has produced nothing concrete. What amazes me is the transformation we are seeing in the way we resist. Our struggle previously was between armed Palestinian fighters and Israeli snipers, tanks and F-16s. Now, it is a struggle between the occupation and peaceful protesters — men and women, young and old. The Great Return March reminds the world about the origin of the conflict — our uprooting from our lands and our lives, beginning in 1948 and sustained since then. We have chosen May 15 as the culmination of our protests because that is the day that Palestinians mark the “nakba,” the Arabic word for catastrophe, which is what we call the expulsions from our homes 70 years ago. Whatever solution we negotiate in the future to allow our two peoples to live together peacefully and equally must start with a recognition of this wrong. Still, despite the response from Israeli snipers, I continue to be committed to nonviolence, as are all of the other people “coordinating” this march. I use quotation marks because when a movement becomes this large — attracting what we estimate to be as many as 200,000 people on Fridays — it cannot be completely controlled. We discouraged the burning of Israeli flags and the attachment of Molotov cocktails to kites. We want peaceful, equal coexistence to be our message. We have also tried to discourage protesters from attempting to cross into Israel. However, we can’t stop them. It is the action of an imprisoned people yearning for freedom, one of the strongest motivations in human nature. Likewise, the people won’t go away on May 15. We are intent on continuing our struggle until Israel recognizes our right to return to our homes and land from which we were expelled. Desperation fuels this new generation. We are not going back to our subhuman existence. We will keep knocking at the doors of international organizations and our Israeli jailers until we see concrete steps to end the blockade of Gaza.",Palestinian demonstrators flee Israeli fire and tear gas during a protest on the Israel-Gaza border on Monday.,2018-05-14T22:31:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",I Helped Start the Gaza Protests.

Meaningful rains aren't expected during the summer, and lacking winter rains left the region with about 30 percent less rainfall than usual, as of late June. These parched lands, combined with hot temperatures and wind, fueled the County Fire, as well as others to the north, like the Pawnee Fire. In October 2017, historic fires in and around the wine country burned down over 8,000 structures, killing 44 people. These flames were helped by "" diablo winds "" reaching 79 miles per hour and vegetation that had been turned to tinder, after being dried out by the hottest California summer on record. More extreme wildfires are an expected part of California's future, as scientists say climate change has begun to lock into a cycle where ""climate whiplash"" is the norm. Under these conditions, the state will alternate between years of extreme drought followed by deluges of rain. And during times of extended drought, more wildfire is expected. Already, the pattern appears to have emerged. From 2012 to 2016, the state experienced its worst drought on record, and likely worst in centuries more. This was followed by a winter deluge, one of the wettest in the state's history.","Ash is once again raining down upon California's Bay area, as the parched land to the north ignites.

Tom McKay,"The fire that raged through President Donald Trump’s famous New York skyscraper and headquarters, Trump Tower, and killed residential tenant Todd Brassner on April 7th appears to have been the result of too many power strips, the New York Fire Department said on Monday. According to the FDNY, fire marshals—the agency’s police force handling serious fire investigations—have concluded that the blaze was accidental and caused by “sequenced power strips powering multiple components.” Chaining power strips together can easily result in disaster, since they can overheat if they draw more power than they are certified to handle. In particular, fire officials tend to warn that devices like space heaters or home appliances should not be plugged into cheap extension cords or power strips lest they start a fire. Per the National Fire Prevention Association, cords and plugs were implicated in 10 percent of overall fires, but 28 percent of the 400 civilian deaths and 20 percent of the 1,180 civilian injuries that resulted from them. So this should be a reminder that plugging one power strip into another is not really very advisable, particularly when the intent is to connect more devices to the same outlet than could fit into one strip alone. Investigators also determined that Brassner’s unit did not have a smoke alarm, something required by city law of owners, though CBS News reported that there were detectors installed in the tower’s heating and ventilation system that first notified them of the blaze. The unit also lacked sprinklers. As the New York Daily News reported, nearly two decades ago Trump rallied against proposed city regulations that would require sprinklers in all residential buildings after 1998 saw two deadly blazes that resulted in the deaths of three firefighters and four tenants. Trump argued sprinklers were too expensive to install in every structure, though he eventually backed off his opposition when city officials exempted buildings already constructed—like Trump Tower—or with constructionpermits on file. Trump later installed sprinklers in some buildings, such as Trump World Tower. According to CBS, the 67-year-old Brassner was an art collector who purchased his unit in 1996 and in recent years fell into poor financial and physical health. Bankruptcy documents say Brassner was “plagued with debilitating medical problems” that limited his ability to function. Though the president quickly—and apparently before the official determination —announced the blaze had been put out and thanked firefighters via Twitter, he has not tweeted about Brassner’s death, CBS noted. The network added that Trump was not present during the blaze, nor were any family members: President Donald Trump has an office and a penthouse home in the building, but he was not in New York at the time. The Secret Service checked the president’s residence at some point and found that there was no fire damage.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Footage shows São Paulo tower block collapse A man who died when a burning tower block collapsed in Brazil's largest city, São Paulo, was only seconds away from being rescued, firefighters say. Ricardo, whose last name is not yet known, had gone back into the building to alert others of the fire when he was trapped by the flames. Firefighters threw him a rope and a harness from a neighbouring building. But before he could tie it around himself, the building collapsed and he was buried beneath the burning rubble. 'Accident waiting to happen' The building in central São Paulo once housed the federal police offices but was vacated by the force years ago. Image copyright AFP Image caption The building collapsed after a fire tore through it Image copyright AFP Image caption Firefighters are still searching through the rubble for dozens of people who may have been inside About 250 people are believed to have been staying in the crumbling 26-storey tower when a fire broke out in the early hours of Tuesday. Wood used to divide the floors into living spaces fuelled the flames. The fire spread rapidly from the lower floors through the empty lift shafts which acted like a chimney. São Paulo Governor Márcio França described it as ""an accident waiting to happen"". According to residents, Ricardo, whom they called Tattoed, had already escaped the blaze when he decided to help those on the higher floors get out. Jéssica Matos, 20, t old Folha newspaper that she passed Ricardo on the second floor of the staircase. ""I'm going upstairs to send the people down,"" he reportedly shouted. Another resident, 27-year-old Wanderley Ribeiro told the newspaper that he saw Ricardo on the eighth floor knocking on doors and offering to help people. 'Get me out' As the building filled with smoke and flames, he could not get down again. A firefighter spotted him clinging to a lightning rod high up on the building's wall. Sgt Diego Pereira Santos, who was evacuating people from the neighbouring building, said he was able to speak to Ricardo from a 15th-floor window. ""I begged him not to jump because the spot where he was was stable,"" the firefighter told Folha. Sgt Santos and his colleagues smashed a whole in the wall of the neighbouring building through which they were able to throw a rope and harness to Ricardo. ""He was shouting 'Get me out of here, please',"" Sgt Santos said. According to the sergeant, Ricardo had started getting into the harness when the building collapsed, the weight of the collapsing structure snapping the rope. Image copyright AFP Image caption Officials said the tower block had been ""uninhabitable"" but that the squatters had refused to leave ""It would have taken 30 to 40 seconds to complete the process,"" Sgt Santos said of the failed rescue. Firefighters found the harness they threw to Ricardo in the rubble but so far have found no trace of him. They are also searching for 44 people who regularly stayed in the building but it is not clear if they were inside at the time of the fire. Almost 250 residents have been moved to shelters. Many described Ricardo as ""a gentle man"" who loved to skate at night and who during the day worked unloading fruit and vegetables at the market.

With the sudden end to negotiations, Hollywood moved closer to a potentially chaotic and unprecedented outcome, with the writers preparing to fire their agents en masse in the coming days.
The fight had been brewing for a year, with the Los Angeles and New York branches of the Writers Guild of America accusing the agents of enriching themselves at their clients expense and demanding that they agree to a new code of conduct.

FRANK BRUNI,"He has detractors, who say that he can be more self-consumed and prickly in private than in public. And its unclear whether he can project the authority and sense of purpose on the national stage that are crucial for a successful presidential campaign and presidency. Its unclear, too, whether a Democrat with a record as moderate as his has a chance in the partys primaries.
Ive known him since late 2010, when I traveled to Denver to do an in-depth profile of him for The Times Magazine. Afterward we became friendly, which isnt surprising. In contrast to Trumps demonization of the media as the enemy of the people, Hickenlooper usually takes the view that if hes open to and trusting of journalists, hell be treated fairly more often than burned. Theres an endearing generosity of spirit in that.
Hickenlooper and his first wife, the journalist Helen Thorpe, divorced during his first term as governor, but did so with such grace and good will that she dedicated her 2014 book, Soldier Girls, to him. At her big Denver reading, he sat in the front row.
And I remember a dinner years later at the Denver home belonging to him and his second wife, Robin Pringle, when he happened to spike a fever shortly before we eight guests arrived. He nonetheless hung in there, bantering with us for hours as if nothing was wrong.
Optimism, warmth and joy matter. They propelled Ronald Reagan to the presidency. I think theyre even a small part of the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez phenomenon the part that leavens the stridency and purity tests. She has a wide, dazzling smile. In a video that went viral, she dances.
Some of the Democrats who are pursuing or seriously considering presidential bids are better at dancing, metaphorically speaking, than others. It doesnt come easily to Bernie Sanders, which is why he added all that poignant family history to his big speech on Saturday, or to Elizabeth Warren, which is why she sipped a beer in an Instagram video that was part of her rollout. Its effortless for Beto ORourke. Its present in Cory Booker. It comes and goes with Kamala Harris, whos still calibrating her temperature.
Hickenlooper sees a sunny approach one that emphasizes aspirations over grievances as the necessary balm for a grossly divided country and the most potent antidote to Trump. In a phone conversation on Tuesday morning, he said that when the president pursues these relentless accusations against all manner of people, hes not just attacking those individuals. Hes also attacking all the people who admire those individuals and feel those individuals represent them.",John Hickenlooper and some of the other Democratic candidates are choosing warmth over fire.,2019-03-05T23:55:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Can Nice Guys Finish Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/opinion/john-hickenlooper-2020.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/opinion/05bruniWeb/05bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fire,1
SHASTA DARLINGTON,"RIO DE JANEIRO At least 10 people were killed on Friday when a fire tore through a dormitory at a youth training center for a professional soccer team in Rio de Janeiro, firefighters and club officials said.
The blaze at the Flamengo club broke out in the early morning when many youth players, ages 14 to 17, were asleep. Three other people were injured, one seriously, and they were taken to a nearby hospital, officials said.
Flamengo is one of Brazils most popular soccer clubs, and some of the countrys biggest stars have played there, including Ronaldinho, who also represented Barcelona and Milan. The training center, called Ninho de Urubu, in the western part of the city, had recently undergone renovations. According to local news media, the dormitory was going to be torn down.

Long before poster artists turned to photography and computer-generated images in the 1980s and ’90s, illustrators like Mr. Gold billboarded movies with freehand drawings, based on scripts and first screen prints, that hinted at plots and moods and mysteries, without giving away too much — priming audiences for love, betrayal, jealousy, murder.

David Murphy,"Nobody likes an operating system that’s full of unnecessary stray files, 20 annoying apps that start up when you fire up your computer, and other crap that slows down your system, makes your desktop feel disorganized, or gives you a headache whenever you’re trying to work (or game). Thankfully, there are a number of free apps that can help you clean your Windows PC. We take spring cleaning very seriously at Lifehacker. Far be it from us to let an opportunity to refresh, reorganize, and declutter our homes lives pass us by. We’re also pretty psyched to hit the reset button on our tech usage, take a close look at our finances, and give the heave-ho to the day-to-day habits that have gotten a little musty. Welcome to Spring Cleaning Week, wherein we clear the cobwebs of winter and set the stage for sunny days ahead. Let’s clean things up, shall we? Disk Cleanup One of the first apps you can try using to get control of a messy Windows PC is Windows’ very own Desk Cleanup app—built right into the operating system and free for you to use at any time. On Windows 10, just pull up the Start Menu and start typing in “Disk,” which should make it easy to load the utility. Pick a drive you want Disk Cleanup to take a look at, likely your system’s primary c:\ drive, and click OK. Once it’s done scanning, Disk Cleanup will tell you about all the different kinds of files that you can safely remove from your system, including the cache for your Edge browser, anything in your Recycle Bin, temporary files left over from apps or app installations, and file thumbnails you might not need anymore—to name a few. You can also click on the “Clean up system files” option to have the app check for log files Windows created during an OS installation, as well as any previous Windows installations that might be lurking around your hard drive (and taking up gigabytes of space). Once you’ve made your selections for deletion, click “OK,” and then “Delete Files,” to begin the process. (You can also use a utility like BleachBit to give your drive a more thorough scrubbing. Just don’t use it to muck with your Windows registry; registry cleaners tend to have little noticeable effect, except for when they completely muck up your system by deleting something they shouldn’t have.) Though this app is more useful for desktop or laptop PCs you just purchased, it’s a great tool for eliminating the more obvious bloatware on your system that, perhaps, you simply forgot about (or never had time to clean). You don’t have to go through any installation routine once you’ve downloaded the app. Just launch it and let it analyze your system. It’ll split any apps it finds into three categories—apps definitely recommended for deletion, questionable apps that people usually remove from their systems, and all other apps. Each app listing tells you whether its a regular application you load yourself or one what starts when your computer launches, a percent that indicates how many other PC Decrapifier users also removed that app, and occasionally a little question mark icon that takes you to the web to learn more about a particular app. All you have to do is select what you want to remove, confirm it on the next screen (which also allows you to create a Windows restore point if you’re feeling nervous), and let the app flush your unwanted apps down the digital drain. Toolbars, spyware, and other kinds of malware can make your PC a mess. Even if you’re a semi-savvy computer user, however, you’re probably pretty good about avoiding the common traps: apps that solicit you to add crappy third-party items to their regular installation process or websites that cajole you to try out a scammy-sounding app—things like that. That said, it never hurts to run a quick scan every now and then to make sure there’s nothing on your computer that shouldn’t be there. You probably don’t need to pay for a real-time malware scanning app when you have something like AdwCleaner, a lightweight app that requires no installation to effectively (and efficiently) scan your system for crap. The company that makes the ever-popular Malwarebytes anti-malware app owns AdwCleaner. While you can always switch up to the former for extra protection, given its reputation, the app feels a little more bloaty and definitely loves to let you know about its Premium services. This one’s for you, gamers. You might not even know that the major online distribution services—Steam, Origin, Uplay, and GoG—might leave some crap on your hard drive even after you’ve uninstalled a game you’re done playing. Even though this app is called “Steam Cleaner,” it does a great job of scanning through each service’s default installation folders and identifying leftover files from past games that you can safely remove. With some simple scanning, you could save gigabytes of space. (For regular apps, consider using a program like Revo Uninstaller to ensure that all traces of a program are deleted whenever you want to remove it from your system.) Having to navigate to your Windows desktop to fiddle with your Recycle Bin is annoying. While it’s easy to delete (or shift-delete) files from File Explorer, it’s always nice to have a trash can at the ready. This tiny utility drops a Recycle Bin directly in your system tray, which makes it much easier to drag-and-drop files to oblivion, empty the trash, and restore that which you accidentally deleted.","Nobody likes an operating system that’s full of unnecessary stray files, 20 annoying apps that start up when you fire up your computer, and other crap that slows down your system, makes your desktop feel disorganized, or gives you a headache whenever you’re t…",2018-04-12T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Five Apps for Keeping Windows Clean,https://lifehacker.com/five-apps-for-keeping-windows-clean-1825209052,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--dQYQZHx1--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/n8zxz3fo0xs8slf8u6so.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,fire,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The bus caught fire on the Via del Tritone A public bus engulfed in flames in a European capital city - but no one in Rome thought to blame terrorism. Instead they wearily pointed the finger at the city's beleaguered transport authority, Atac. The blaze on the number 63 bus, which happened on the busy Via del Tritone shopping street in the city centre on Tuesday, was the ninth this year and follows 22 more last year. So frequent have the fireballs become that they have their own social media hashtag #flambus (which rhymes with Trambus, Atac's previous name). ""Only in Rome does a bus explode in the heart of the city and people immediately blame Atac, with no thought of terrorism. It says a lot about our emergencies,"" said journalist Raffaella Menichini on social media. Atac blamed an ageing fleet and said the number of incidents was down on last year. How dangerous are the fires? In its statement, Atac said no passengers had been hurt. But local media reported that a shop assistant working in a store near where the bus caught fire had been taken to hospital suffering from a burn to the arm and shock. No passengers have been hurt in previous fires either, local reports say. But observers fear that it is only a matter of time before there are victims. ""Every day there is greater risk,"" wrote transport consultant Fabio Rosati, adding that an ""urgent plan"" to replace buses was needed. Image copyright EPA Image caption ""It could have been a massacre,"" one journalist said Journalist Michele Galvani accused the city authorities of ""playing with citizens' lives"". ""Today could have been a massacre. In which other European capital do buses explode like this? These jokers play with citizens' lives and continue to make announcements,"" he said. In March after the year's fifth bus fire, union officials warned of the risks to travellers. ""Atac services are unsafe. Drivers just have to pray that nothing happens and we don't want to think about what could happen when the hot weather comes because if we wait for this authority to solve the problem then we're in trouble. Or indeed, incinerated,"" the Faisa Confail union's regional secretary Claudio De Francesco told Roma Today. What is wrong with the buses? The transport authority said the Mercedes Citaro bus that caught fire in Via del Tritone dated from 2003 and said its fleet ""unfortunately has a very high average age"". Preliminary investigations say the bus suffered a short circuit before the blaze broke out, La Repubblica reported. Image copyright EPA Image caption Unions say the buses suffer from a lack of maintenance The fire began at the back of the bus and the bus driver quickly evacuated passengers before the flames spread, the newspaper said. Video posted on social media appeared to show smoke pouring out of the back of the bus before an explosion accompanied by a loud bang that scattered onlookers. Initial attempts to put the fire out with fire extinguishers failed but firefighters were on the scene shortly afterwards. Drivers' unions say the buses suffer from a lack of maintenance. A series of internal investigations have failed to stop the fires. Last month a bus that was just five years old caught fire, The Local reported. What is being done? Atac insists that it has increased fire-prevention measures and says that these have reduced fires by a quarter this year. That is not enough for some, however. Carlo Rienzi from the consumer rights group Codacons said the ""umpteenth"" fire had prompted his organisation to demand that the public prosecutor take buses out of circulation if safety cannot be guaranteed. ""We can no longer be silent about what seems to all intents and purposes an emergency,"" Codacons said in a statement. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The blaze left a nearby building's facade blackened Some on social media have blamed the administration of Mayor Virginia Raggi. She is from the populist Five Star Movement and won power in 2016 promising to improve the city's notorious transport, water and rubbish services, which have long been plagued by corruption and a lack of investment. Rome newspaper Diario Romano said Ms Raggi had not got to grips with the city's transport problems and accused her of ""two years of failure"". One left-wing activist even compared her leadership to that of Emperor Nero from classical Rome, who is popularly said to have played the fiddle as fire devastated the city in the year 64. ""Not even Nero did what Raggi is doing,"" the activist said on social media.",The latest blaze is at least the ninth so far this year and the public is getting increasingly angry.,2018-05-08T16:16:25Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Why do Rome's buses keep catching fire?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44041597,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p066jycw.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fire,1

Rachel Kraus,"As Southern California firefighters continue their struggle to contain fires throughout Los Angeles and surrounding counties on Wednesday, commuters found themselves driving next to raging fires that now are threatening the Westwood, Brentwood and Bel-Air neighborhoods of West L.A. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Bel-Air fire, which shut down the 405 freeway in both directions, began in the hills of Brentwood and traveled up the Santa Monica Mountains into the Bel-Air neighborhood. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Described as a ""fast moving, 6-acre wildfire"" by the Times, the fire has prompted evacuations in the gated community of Bel-Air with several homes now burning. Officials have also closed the 405 freeway in both directions, as the fire rages in the hills along the Getty Center exit.

The winds are also helping to cause fires to exhibit extreme fire behavior, making them difficult to impossible to control. West Los Angeles neighborhoods are connected by the Santa Monica Mountains, known to hikers and Angelenos as the ""backbone."" That interconnectivity is what has prompted officials to warn residents of Mandeville Canyon and other areas in Brentwood to prepare for evacuation.

Rachel Kraus,"At least three fires are devastating Southern California, devouring Ventura and Santa Ana counties with flames, and stifling surrounding counties, including Los Angeles, with smoke. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying The fires began on Monday night and continued to spread throughout the day on Tuesday. So far, the Rye Fire in Santa Clarita has burned 1,000 acres, per ABC News. Santa Ana's Creek Fire has destroyed 11,000 acres, according to the Los Angeles Times. And the Thomas Fire, which has been burning the longest, has torn through a massive 50,000 acres in Ventura County.

NASA satellite shows smoke plumes and heat signatures (red dots) from the wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area on Dec. 5, 2017 Image: NASA WorldView The fires have spread so quickly and grown so large thanks to the California weather phenomenon known as the Santa Ana winds. The east-to-west blowing winds come from the Pacific and tap into warm and dry conditions inland. The winds push against the air coming from the LA basin's eastern mountains, which compresses the wind and heat between the ocean and the mountains, further drying out vegetation that has dried out over the summer. The phenomenon makes for dangerous fire conditions, which is now affecting residents across Southern California, from Ventura County to the north, and Santa Clarita and Santa Ana to the east. The Los Angeles Fire Department has ordered the evacuation of the 20.5 square miles including and surrounding the Creek Fire, which jumped the 210 Freeway and is threatening Santa Ana's Sylmar and Lake View Terrace neighborhoods. The Rye Fire in Santa Clarita prompted the shutdown of Highway 5. Reuters reports that hundreds of homes have been destroyed by the Thomas Fire. Across Southern California, people are packing up their homes, and rescuing and sequestering animals, to salvage what they can from the blaze. Some residents were even seen fighting the fire with water hoses. LA County Fire Chief Daryl L.

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","Oh, hello. Do I have your attention? Are you ready to fire off an angry comment, condemning me and my worst take yet? I feel you friend, for I had a similar reaction when someone told me that potatoes au gratin didn’t need any cheese. Honestly, that fateful day was a real rollercoaster. When this woman, whom I had paid to instruct me in the ways of French cooking, first informed me we would be making potatoes au gratin, I was very pleased, but when she told me we wouldn’t be using any cheese, I was very sad. She assured me it would be fine, better even, than any au gratin I had ever had before. I was like “big if true,” which was met with a blank stare, because my teacher was a refined French lady, not an internet-dwelling, millennial raccoon. Anyway. Technically “gratin” just means “topped with a brown crust,” but that crust is usually cheese, breadcrumbs, or breadcrumbs and cheese. This recipe, however, omits cheese entirely, and consists of nothing more than potatoes, heavy cream, and salt. It seems too simple, but it is, in a word, “dope.” The starch from the potatoes mixes with cream to create the richest sauce imaginable, while the top transforms into a magical layer of deeply golden, bubbling dairy crust that is very reminiscent of, well, cheese. It also couldn’t be easier, or cheaper, to assemble. Thinly slice some potatoes—Russets are fine—and layer them in a casserole dish, overlapping the edges slightly. Sprinkle them with salt, then pour some cream on top until they are just submerged. Repeat this process, alternating potatoes, salt, and cream, until you’ve filled your dish. You can of course add some cheese in there if you want—I’m not your boss—but I urge you to enjoy this oh so simple iteration before futzing with it. Bake it in a 375-degree oven until the browned and the cream is bubbling in an aggressive fashion. Let it cool for five minutes or so—just so the sauce doesn’t spill everywhere—and scoop onto some very lucky plates for some very lucky people.","Oh, hello. Do I have your attention?

Nick Douglas,"Mashable, a tech site, says you should buy a kiddie pool. Not for your kids, for yourself. As they point out, if you have a roof or backyard, fifteen bucks, and a garden hose or a big bucket, then baby, you’ve got a pool going. (They claim you can also put a kiddie pool on your fire escape. I cannot endorse that particular variation.) Your kiddie pool will get filthy fast, and you’ll look like a hipster from 2009, but you’ll use much less water or space than you would with an “adult” pool. You can fill it in five minutes and empty it in one. You never have to learn how chlorine tablets work. I’d like to point out one more big advantage: it’s not a bath. A bath, like a large coffee or a tweet, is always regrettable. This is because you expect a bath to feel like an expensive spa, when it is actually just a tepid soak in your own filth with your neck craned. A bath is a disappointment, but a kiddie pool is not, because: It is outdoors, where expectations are lowered. (Ask anyone who has brunched at a sidewalk table.) It is for cooling, not for warming. Water is better at cooling than warming. This is known. You aren’t trying to clean yourself. You get to (probably have to) keep some clothes on. Wearing clothes in water is actually very cool. You can lie in it, or you can just soak your feet in it. You can drink beer in it. You can lie down in it and then sit in the sun to dry out. A kiddie pool is nature’s air conditioning. For a real trip, you could fill your kiddie pool with a substance other than water, like slime or spaghetti, which probably is a disappointment but that one scene in Patch Adams made it look like a blast. Only do it at the end of the season, when you never plan to put water in the pool again. Take pics. So if you are privileged enough to own or rent a home with outdoor space, live life to the fullest by buying and using a kiddie pool. Maybe even let a kid in.

 Russian rescuers have gone to the scene (file pic of coastguard boat)
Two Tanzania-flagged cargo vessels are ablaze in the Black Sea near the Kerch Strait, and Russian rescuers are trying to reach sailors who jumped overboard.
So far three have been rescued and one dead body has been recovered, Russia's maritime agency Rosmorrechflot says. 
One ship is a gas tanker, and the fire reportedly followed an explosion, which set the other vessel on fire.
They were named as the Kandy, with a crew of 17 from Turkey and India, and Maestro, with 14 sailors.
The Kerch Strait is a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. 
In November Russian border guards seized three Ukrainian naval vessels near the narrow channel, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov. 
A court in Russia has extended by three months the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the incident. They are accused of illegally crossing into Russian territory.
Ukraine condemned the Russian move, denying that its ships had violated the navigation laws in the area.

The blaze, known as the Woolsey Fire, is spreading south, has jumped a major highway and is now threatening coastal areas including parts of Malibu. However there were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries. Another blaze in northern California has destroyed one town and is threatening another, officials say. Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman, said a number of civilians and firefighters had been injured in the fire north of Sacramento but it would be days before the authorities knew whether anyone had died. Where is the Woolsey Fire spreading to? The blaze has spread rapidly overnight, fanned by strong winds, and has jumped Highway 101, a major route west of Los Angeles. The flames are now threatening coastal areas further south, fire officials said. The fire broke out near Thousand Oaks, an area about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles where an attacker killed 12 people on Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of 75,000 homes. Residents have now been ordered to evacuate from several more towns to the west of Thousand Oaks, including Calabasas immediately south of Highway 101 and Malibu on the coast, as well as from the western edge of Los Angeles. Calabasas and Malibu are home to numerous celebrities and some have been posting on social media, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian. On Instagram she urged people to ""pray for Calabasas"". ""Just landed back home and had one hour to pack up and evacuate our home. I pray everyone is safe,"" she wrote.

Media caption The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest Fire officials have issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. Earlier, the fire devastated the town of Paradise in the Sierra foothills, home to 26,000 people. ""There's nothing left standing,"" said Mr Maclean.

Accidents gridlocked routes out of Paradise and residents abandoned their cars and fled on foot carrying children and pets, Reuters quoted local officials as saying. Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Patients were evacuated from a hospital in Paradise that later burned down Rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said. The two blazes are among 16 currently active fires in California. Officials have put most of Northern California under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A bus in a kibbutz was set ablaze after being hit and an Israeli seriously wounded Israel says its fighter jets have hit dozens of Palestinian militant targets overnight in Gaza after militants fired 370 rockets at Israel. At least three Palestinians died in the strikes on Gaza, while a civilian was killed in a rocket attack in the Israeli town of Ashkelon. Both Israel and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, have threatened to escalate their actions. Violence erupted when a covert Israeli mission got exposed in Gaza on Sunday. Seven Palestinian militants, including a Hamas military commander, were killed during the incident, including a member of the Israeli undercover unit. How serious is the upsurge? After a brief lull following Sunday night's violence, a barrage of rockets was launched towards Israel late on Monday. A bus, which had reportedly been carrying troops, was hit by an anti-tank missile in a kibbutz, seriously wounding a male soldier. Overnight rockets hit border communities, including the city of Ashkelon several miles north of Gaza, where a building was struck, killing a civilian and seriously wounding another. Israel carried out waves of air strikes against Hamas and the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad faction across the Gaza Strip. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Israeli air strikes targeted the Hamas-run television station Al-Aqsa The Israeli military said more than 100 military targets were hit, including ""a unique vessel"" belonging to Hamas in a harbour in southern Gaza. Palestinian officials said at least three people, two of them militants, were killed and another died after being injured earlier. The building housing Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV was hit and destroyed after being evacuated, disrupting broadcasts. Israel said the outlet ""contributes to Hamas's military actions"". It is one of the most serious rounds of fighting since Israel and Hamas fought a war in 2014. Israel has warned it is prepared to ""dial up its response"" to Hamas, while Hamas's military wing said it was ready to ""expand the circle of fire"" against Israel. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said efforts were being made with Egypt to pull Gaza ""back from the brink"". ""The escalation in the past 24hrs is EXTREMELY dangerous,"" he tweeted on Monday night. How did the violence start? Palestinians said they discovered an undercover Israeli unit in a civilian car about 3km (2 miles) inside the Gaza Strip late on Sunday. A firefight ensued in which the Hamas commander was killed. Israel launched air strikes and opened fire with tanks on the area, witnesses said. Six other militants were killed as well as one of the Israeli special forces soldiers. The incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. Why did Israel kill the commander? Due to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission. The IDF said, however, that the operation was ""not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security"". Image copyright Reuters Image caption Israel carried out air strikes when Sunday night's firefight erupted The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong. The exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says. Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, denounced Sunday's incident as a ""cowardly Israeli attack"". Why are Israel and Hamas enemies? Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year. While Mr Abbas's umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it. Image copyright AFP Image caption Schools have been ordered to close in Israeli border communities as a precaution Israel, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006 in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants. Israel and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israeli air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence. Sunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months.",The violence is among the worst since 2014 and follows a covert Israeli mission exposed on Sunday.,2018-11-13T07:45:05Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Heavy Gaza-Israel fire traded overnight,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-46190571,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1035F/production/_104299366_gazbus.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fire,1
HARRY LITMAN,"Photo Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, last January. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Thursday’s r eport in The Times that President Trump ordered the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller last June, only to back off after the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to resign, is explosive on many levels. On the surface, the revelation is one more piece of damning evidence in the now-overwhelming case of obstruction of justice that Mr. Mueller has assembled. The core of the case — the Feb. 14 meeting in which Mr. Trump asked the director of the F.B.I., James Comey, to drop the investigation against the national security adviser, Michael Flynn; Mr. Trump’s subsequent sacking of Mr. Comey; and Mr. Trump’s serial lies about Mr. Comey’s firing — has long been solid. And Mr. Mueller has added significant pieces of circumstantial evidence, such as Mr. Trump’s apparent knowledge that Mr. Flynn had lied to the F.B.I. when he buttonholed Mr. Comey. Thursday’s revelation seals the deal. The president’s attempted ouster of Mr. Mueller seems plainly to have been intended to squelch Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Moreover, Mr. Trump’s attempts to conceal the obvious with a rank, virtually comical explanation provide additional evidence of guilty intent. Mr. Mueller, the president argued, could not serve because, years before, he had resigned his membership at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia because of a dispute over fees; or he needed to be fired because he had worked at the law firm that previously represented Mr. Trump’s son-in law, Jared Kushner. Why strain to concoct such feeble rationales unless the truth is indefensible? Then there is the provocative point that Mr. Trump’s efforts were parried by the threat to resign of his own White House counsel, Mr. McGahn. White House counsels are not in the habit of bucking their bosses that way; it’s an extraordinarily rare event. Mr. McGahn obviously feared at least a political firestorm; yet if that was all he feared, one would expect him to have saluted and carried out the president’s orders. Concerns about politics aren’t a hallmark of Mr. McGahn’s tenure, to say the least. The threat to resign carries with it the possible implication that he saw more: a crime, even a continuing conspiracy, that he wanted to distance both Mr. Trump and himself from. That sort of intervention is consistent with more principled motives, and a desire to save Mr. Trump not only from himself but from despoiling the presidency (which the White House counsel in fact represents). It’s also consistent with the Washington tradition of self-serving conduct with an eye toward ensuring that you don’t go down with the ship. Perhaps in this case it was both. In any event, Mr. McGahn’s pushback starts to look like a John Dean moment in the Trump administration: the juncture when actors in the White House, including the White House counsel, began to realize that there is, in Mr. Dean’s famous phrase, “a cancer on the presidency.” Reports have been rife of a dispirited and paranoid White House, with as many internecine battles as there are combinations of officials.

DECLAN WALSH,"Of the 86 fishermen on the six boats, 50 died. Identifying the perpetrators of maritime attacks is notoriously difficult, especially in a war as chaotic and opaque as the one in Yemen. Both the Saudi-led coalition and its Houthi foes, who are backed by Iran, have carried out attacks at sea. But maritime experts, a former United States Navy officer, United Nations investigators and several Yemeni officials said there was little doubt that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for some if not all of the violence against fishermen. Saudi and Emirati naval boats dominate the Red Sea waters where the shootings and bombings took place. Five involved attack helicopters, which the Houthis do not have. In one instance, Saudi officials made cash payments of nearly $500,000 to the families of fishermen killed in an attack. In another, coalition sailors detained 12 survivors and held them for three months in a Saudi prison, where the fishermen said they were interrogated and tortured. Eight of those detainees were recently released after receiving a payment of $1,300 each from their Saudi captors. A soldier posed with us in the prison for a photo and said, Sorry if we hurt you, Yaqoub Okad, 20, said in an interview after his return to Yemen. In a statement issued via the embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, a coalition spokesman, Col. Turki al-Malki, confirmed that a coalition vessel had opened fire on that boat, the Ansar, and captured 12 fishermen. He said the boats crew had ignored warnings from a warship accompanying a Saudi oil tanker through the Red Sea. Three of the fishermen turned out to be armed Houthi terrorists, he said. Colonel Malki declined to answer questions about the other five attacks between Aug. 1 and Sept. 15, which he said had been referred to the coalitions internal investigations body.","Outrage over civilian deaths in Yemen has focused on airstrikes.

ISABELLA GRULLÓN PAZ,"Back in December, Representative John Conyers Jr. resigned his seat in Michigan’s 13th District over sexual harassment allegations. He had been one of Congress’s longest-serving members, having represented the district, which is 57 percent black, for 52 years. Eight months later, on Tuesday, there was a special primary election to fill his seat for the remaining few months of his term. Tuesday was also the day of a primary election to fill the open position in Congress’s next term. Two races on the same day for the same seat in different terms. Confused? So were we. The easy answer is to save money, or at least that’s the reason Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder gave in a statement in December. Instead of hosting a separate special election to fill Mr. Conyers’s seat, he scheduled the special election to be on the same days as the primary and general voting already scheduled for 2018 to save taxpayers the expense of hosting more elections. Governor Snyder also said he wanted to give ample time for candidates to decide whether to run for the seat. In the same news release, he said that the more time candidates have to file their paperwork gives constituents more options as to who will next represent them in Congress. More time to file means more people would file.","Rashida Tlaib, center, cast her ballot at a Detroit Fire Department station on Tuesday.",2018-08-09T20:45:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rashida Tlaib Won a Primary on Tuesday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires. But it will also forever live in nightmares for unleashing one of the most terrifying spectacles on Earth in the form of a firenado. On Wednesday, CAL FIRE released three new videos that show the firenado ripping through the Northern California countryside on July 26. The state fire agency also announced that a local fire inspector was killed by the fiery winds. The videos were captured on the ground and from the air by CAL FIRE and local fire departments. They reveal vegetation burning red hot and a tight column of smoke, fire and ash spiraling higher into the sky in what looks like a scene straight out of a horror movie right before a portal to hell opens. But no, this is life on Earth, a reminder that our planet is capable of spinning up terrifying meteorological events all on its own. We know that vegetation burned at incredibly high temperatures, causing air to rise and rotate. And scientists estimate that those firenado winds reached 143 mph, the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado, and spanned an area as wide as three football fields on the ground. But while we know the outlines of what caused it and how serious the damage was, there’s also a ton of open questions about the firenado. That’s because we have precious few examples to compare it to and glean data from. With a paucity of examples and research to draw on, scientists are going to be studying the conditions and aftermath of the Carr Fire firenado for a long time in an attempt to better understand just what happened. The Carr Fire continues to burn, though firefighters have gotten a much better grip on it since the fateful night it tore into the small city of Redding in late July. As of Thursday, the fire was 71 percent contained after charring 214,527 acres, which puts it at the eighth-largest wildfire in state history. But the toll it’s taken has been steep. At least eight have perished, including three firefighters battling the blaze. It has also destroyed 1,599 structures, making it the sixth-most destructive fire in California history.",The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The pictures from the ground of the Carr Fire showed devastation on a human scale. But new aerial imagery released by the city of Redding puts the massive wildfire in a landscape context, revealing the both the power and capriciousness of one the most destructive fires in California history. Firefighters and sheriffs used drones to better assess the damage wrought by the fire and to piece together the history of what happened two weeks ago when it stormed Redding, a city of 90,000, overnight. The blaze has killed at least eight, burned 178,752 acres, and razed 1,599 structures. As of Friday, it was 49 percent contained. The fire swept in from the west of the city where it burned largely in tracts of forest around Whiskeytown Lake. The images from there show charred trees and denuded hillsides. Whiskeytown Lake.

JOHN LELAND and JOE CARROTTA,"Eighteen fire departments, hundreds of locals and a couple thousand water balloons. It was war, and good clean fun. Each July 4 for the last 20 years, fire departments from around Long Island have gathered in the village of Stewart Manor for an annual parade and water battle with local residents. For townspeople, it’s an opportunity to bond with first responders and share the day’s patriotic — oh, who are we kidding? It’s a chance to chuck water balloons at people on big trucks!!! Game on! It’s a classic shootout: The firefighters have the guns, but the residents have the numbers. This year, with temperatures in the 80s and humidity levels of approximately 4 million percent, water warriors came out by the hundreds, wielding balloons, hoses, water guns, even buckets. Eighteen local fire departments joined the mayhem. “It was more hectic than usual,” said Joe Carrotta, 23, who has been photographing the parade since 2014. “Firemen were chucking buckets of water or shooting water cannons straight down at people who ran up to attack them.” Mr. Carrotta first experienced the parade in 2010, as a high school volunteer in the Garden City Park fire department. “You’re just getting pelted,” he said of life on his squad’s float, where he joined three years’ worth of battles. “People come with very, very heavy artillery. You’re going into their town, and they’re sitting on their lawns with hoses.” On the other hand, he said, the firefighters also came prepared. “Each float has at least 2,000 water balloons in a cooler,” he said. After high school, Mr. Carrotta got a camera and forgot about becoming a firefighter. But he kept returning to the fray. He used an underwater camera because anything else would be destroyed by the water, and he welcomed the occasional crossfire. “I want that effect of people shooting at me and hitting me,” he said. “I don’t mind getting wet.” As this year’s parade progressed, firefighters jumped off the floats or trucks to bring the battle to the townspeople, some brandishing garbage-can lids as shields, others dressed as superheroes. And when it was over, the various departments took aim at one another. “We get wet but we love it,” said Frederick Powell, the village fire chief, who was participating in his 20th parade, and has volunteered in the department for 41 years. “When I was a kid in this village we never had much going on,” he said. “But this thing? I wish I was a kid out there today.” Oh, but he was. He was. John Leland, a Metro reporter, joined The Times in 2000. His most recent book is “Happiness Is a Choice You Make: Lessons From a Year Among the Oldest Old,” based on a Times series. @ johnleland","Eighteen fire departments, hundreds of locals and a couple thousand water balloons.

GAIL COLLINS,"That would be the job of the Department of the Interior, which is run by Ryan Zinke, a great pal of the oil industry. Zinke has yet to come up with nominations for some of the department’s most important posts. There’s serious understaffing and low morale, which he responded to by instituting a take-your-dog-to-work program. And just to make sure we’re comfortable, Zinke is preparing to repeal the safety regulations that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon explosion dumped hundreds of millions of gallons of oil into the water off Louisiana. Now, the Trump administration had a new and unnerving policy, plus a rising pile of evidence that any bad results were likely to occur in the worst way possible. It was time for a bizarre Step 3. Zinke suddenly announced that Florida was “unique” and that there would be no offshore drilling there. People, why do you think Florida is “unique”? A) It has a Republican governor who might try to run for the Senate. B) It looks most like a thumb. C) Trump didn’t want anybody messing with the view at Mar-a-Lago. It’s true about the governor, but C sounds completely reasonable. There is no doubt, even among many Trump supporters, that this is a guy who would change a major federal policy to protect his view. A lot of other coastal Republicans demanded to know why their states didn’t get the same special treatment. Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina howled that the Mar-a-Lago angle sounded “self-serving.” Sanford is the guy who sneaked out of the governor’s office to visit a mistress in South America and is, of course, well known for never thinking of himself first. Still, here’s the bottom line on offshore drilling: We’re looking at a big change that many people hate, which will probably be badly overseen and which appears to be organized around principles so daffy they don’t make sense even to Trump’s own party. One, two, three, we’re out. Now, about immigration. Given the tenor of Trump’s campaign, we knew there was going to be trouble. Step 1 came when he killed an Obama administration program protecting Dreamers — young people who were brought across the border as children and grew up as Americans. It appeared there was a good chance Congress would take care of the problem during the ongoing budget negotiations. Then Trump decided he wanted to play hero. He called an on-camera, bipartisan meeting in which he urged everyone to come up with a Dreamers-protection deal right away and vowed he’d sign anything they came up with. He was so virtuous you’d have thought he had a halo, except it was just that hair. For a minute, it looked like the crisis was over. Then, in a very short space of time, Trump vaulted into Step 2, yelling “No! No! No!” when asked if he’d accept any plan that didn’t include a border wall. The Republicans and Democrats came up with a compromise that ties protection for the Dreamers to a ton of nonwall security money. The sheer reasonableness of their effort triggered Step 3, in which Trump rejected everything, complained about the “shithole countries” and sent Washington into chaos. During the ensuing uproar, via Twitter, the president sort of denied he’d said anything unusual and claimed some of his best friends were Haitians. While the whole world was reacting, with the deepest negativity, Trump took time out to tell The Wall Street Journal that he “was always the best athlete. … I was successful at everything I ever did,” going on and on into that smartest-person territory we remember from the “very stable genius” tweets. Meanwhile, if nothing gets worked out, next week the government closes down. Step 4, anyone?

Visiting the scene in Kemerovo, Siberia, Mr Putin berated ""sloppiness"". Investigators say the fire alarm was switched off and exits were blocked when the fire started on Sunday. Interfax news agency reported that some 300 people gathered outside the local government headquarters demanding the dismissal of authorities. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but Russia's Investigative Committee has spoken of ""serious violations"" at the Winter Cherry mall. This is ""no battle action or an unexpected methane outburst in a mine,"" Mr Putin said after laying a wreath at the scene. ""People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? ""Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness."" Sunday's blaze started on an upper floor. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape. Image copyright Reuters Image caption There is shock and anger in Kemerovo as the scale of the devastation sinks in The Investigative Committee says a fire safety technician at the complex ""switched off the alarm system"" after being alerted about the fire. It said a criminal investigation had begun. Five people have been arrested including the official suspected of deactivating the public address system. In a Facebook post (in Russian), Kemerovo politician Anton Gorelkin said that ""fire exits were shut, turning the complex into a trap"" and ""there was no organised evacuation"". He also said a fire extinguisher that could have doused the flames at the start did not work. The region's deputy governor, Vladimir Chernov, said ""this is the question: Why were the doors shut?"" Cigarette lighter? The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Mr Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia.

Kemerovo region has declared three days of mourning, and locals are leaving flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial near the complex. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic. Who were the victims? At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. Officials says 56 bodies have been recovered and the remains of 21 have been released to relatives for burial. Kemerovo lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. Yevgeny Dedyukhin, deputy head of the Kemerovo region emergency department, said the area of the fire was about 1,500 sq m. ""The shopping centre is a very complex construction,"" he said.

Matt Novak,"The so-called Camp Fire has already consumed over 20,000 acres in Northern California, forcing about 50,000 people to evacuate. But the fire has moved so quickly that some people have barely escapedlike Brynn Parrott Chatfield from the town of Paradise, who posted this video to social media showing her familys terrifying drive through the flames yesterday. The video, published to Facebook, truly looks like something out of a movie. Theyre surrounded on both sides with flames lapping at the road as they race to get out. I feel very vulnerable posting this but I feel I should, Brynn Parrott Chatfield wrote on Facebook. My hometown of Paradise is on fire. My family is evacuated and safe. Not all my friends are safe. Its very surreal. Things always work out, but the unknown is a little scary. The fire started in the Feather River Canyon around 6:30am on Thursday morning and its still completely uncontained. The governor has declared a state of emergency and its believed that over 1,000 homes have already been destroyed, according to the Butte County Fire Chief Darren Read. As CNN points out, over 2,200 firefighters are currently battling the Camp Fire and they face a tough road ahead. The combination of dry conditions and high winds are making this a particularly difficult fire to fight. Multiple fatalities have been reported but its not yet clear how many people might be dead. The exact number of injuries is also unknown and authorities still dont know what caused the blaze. How fast is this fire moving? Its burning up the equivalent of 80 football fields per minute. Residents in towns like Paradise, Chico, Magalia, Concow, Yankee Hill, Butte Creek Canyon, Cherokee, and Durham have already been told to evacuate. And emergency responders are doing their best to perform welfare checks on people who are unaccounted for. This fire did move through the town of Paradise quickly, Paradise Police Chief Eric Reinbold told the local Enterprise-Record newspaper.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The confirmed death toll in the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, has risen to 76, with nearly 1,300 names still remaining on an ad hoc list of missing individuals. The town of Paradise, which a firestorm overtook in a matter of hours on Nov. 8, is more or less totally destroyed. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, one question after the disaster is whether officials did enough to prepare for the eventuality of one of the states rampaging wildfires sweeping through the town. Paradise officials had seen one prior fire result in disaster a decade ago, the Times wrote, after a fire stopped at the edge of Paradise and three of the four major roads out of the region were ablaze. The result was hours of gridlock, leaving evacuees defenseless on the road and leading to many trying to outrun the fires on foot: A grand jury report and county fire plans said Paradise needed a way to get everyone out quickly at once. Instead, Paradise leaders divided the town into evacuation zones that could be emptied a few at a time. Following the lead of other fire-prone counties, Butte County contracted for a private warning system to alert residents in dangerif they had the foresight to sign up. The Paradise emergency operations director estimated no more than 30% of citizens were on the list. According to the grand jury report, the Weather Channel wrote, many vehicles carrying evacuees had an effective speed of four miles per hour. The new system didnt work out that much better as the Camp Fire approached Paradise this month. While firefighters issued an evacuation order at 7:46 a.m. local time, that order only applied to the eastern zone of the town, the Times wrote. By the time they issued a general evacuation order applying to the remaining residents almost an hour later, the paper added, the situation had ended up much like the prior fire: The result was that as the Camp fire entered Paradise, the evacuation order issued at 7:46 a.m. covered only the eastern quarter of town. Evacuation orders werent given to the rest of the city for nearly an hour. Within two minutes of the broader warning, the first major traffic jam was reported. Then the evacuation corridors caught fire, as they had a decade before. According to the Times, the main four-lane road for Paradise, the Skylane Boulevard, was designed for 1,200 cars per hour during rush hour, while almost 27,000 residents were subject to the evacuation order. The ensuing chaos saw people fleeing stalled cars on roadsone survivor told the paper her steering wheel began to meltor simply ending up trapped, with emergency services overwhelmed and officers allegedly telling evacuees to commandeer any available vehicles. The problem in Paradise is that you cant get out, NPR reporter Paige St. John explained....Once they needed to move and you had an entire town that needed to get out all at once, the roads quickly turned into parking lots. 36-year-old survivor Eric Smith, standing outside the charred rubble of his childhood home, told the Daily Beast, It looks like a bomb went off. My childhood has burnt down. How could they have organized it? Smith added. The fire was burning 80 football fields a minute. Theres one way in and out of here. I dont know how anyone could have organized anything. A Cal Fire worker told the Beast that many individuals died in their cars. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea added that the evacuation was as orderly as could be under such a very, very frightening situation and that emergency personnel were able to save tens of thousands of lives. However, per the Mercury News, the sheriffs department has conceded that they could have alerted more residents to the danger. Many reported receiving news of the evacuation too late, or not at all, due to an opt-in emergency warning system and a complicated protocol for carrying it out that moved slower than the spreading flames. It got to point where this thing was outrunning us before we even knew we were in race by that time we started trying to message and get that information out there, Honea told the paper. The Mercury News reported: Others also said they didnt get messages from the countys Red Alert program Thursday. No news was delivered over the Amber Alert wireless emergency notification system, or through Nixle, they said. There was nothing on local radio. Television did not interrupt programming with an emergency broadcast system warning. There were no sirens. On Facebook, Cal Fires first post was at 10:07 a.m, and it was general, describing acreage and saying Multiple evacuation orders have been issued. We didnt get a robo call, announcement or any notice from Cal Fire or city, We had to find out about it second-hand, said Ethan Silverman. Neighbors they came up and down the road telling us to leave, said Gabriel Wilcox. Mayor Jody Jones pointed towards the decision of many residents not to opt into the emergency alert system, telling the Mercury News: There isnt a town anywhere that could build the infrastructure so you would not have gridlock when you are evacuating everyone all at once. Had we not had that plan, had we not practiced the plan, we would have lost so many more lives. [L.A.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires. Since early August—wintertime in the southern hemisphere— hundreds of bushfires have flared up in the Australian provinces of Queensland and New South Wales, prompting some local authorities to declare bushfire season open more than a month ahead of schedule. This freak fire lashing has experts extremely worried for what lies ahead as Australia transitions into spring and then summer. “We’re dreading what the rest of the season holds for us,” former New South Wales Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Greg Mullins told Earther. Fueling the flames is a drought that’s been described as the worst in living memory. Last winter was Australia’s hottest on record and the driest since 2002, and for large swaths of eastern and southern Australia, there’s been little rain to slake the thirst since. About 60 percent of Queensland is currently in drought. So is 100 percent of New South Wales, a province that produces a quarter of the nation’s crops. Many of its fields are looking frighteningly brown. This winter has also been unusually warm, and that combination of heat and drought is causing landscapes to light up like a tinderbox when something provides the spark. For the most remote fires, the spark is often lightning, but a large number of the blazes are being started by humans as well. Mullins said farmers often use small, contained fires to burn off weeds or undergrowth outside of fire season, but some of those burns have gotten out of hand this winter. Fire managers, who typically use the winter to conduct prescribed burns that reduce fire fuel, are grappling with a similar issue because of the parched conditions. “At least some of the fires in New South Wales originated as hazard reduction burns that got out of control because it was so flammable,” Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council, told Earther. None of this bodes for the months ahead, especially with the eastern Pacific tipping into an El Niño state, something that normally delivers warmer, drier weather to southern Australia. “We’re looking down the barrel at this insane fire season,” University of Tasmania fire ecologist David Bowman told Earther. “It’s difficult to exaggerate just how extreme the whole thing is.” Bowman, Hughes, and Mullins all pointed to climate change as the key driver of longer, more intense fire seasons in Australia, like the one this year’s lining up to be. A 2015 report by the Australia Climate Council reached a similar conclusion, noting that climate change is upping the likelihood of fire weather by increasing the frequency of heat waves and, in southern Australia, exacerbating drought. For Mullins, who’s been fighting bushfires since the early 1970s and whose father was a firefighter for over 60 years before him, decades of life experience tell him how profoundly the fire season has changed. He recalled how the onset of dangerous fire weather used to be far more predictable. Today, it’s not only harder to say when a fire outbreak will occur, but the worst fires are on a scale nobody’s prepared to fight. “It’s the new normal,” Mullins said. “We can’t handle it.”","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires.

CARL ZIMMER,"For early studies of fire refugia, ecologists hiked through forests and grasslands, inspecting islands that withstood surrounding flames. Now researchers are scrutinizing fire refugia from space. With nearly 50 years of satellite data, theyre starting to piece together the recent history of these sanctuaries. After a fire wipes out a forest, fire refugia stand out as green jewels scattered across the blackened land. Depending on the forest, up to 25 percent of it may survive in refugia, Dr. Krawchuk estimated. Sometimes a forest refugium survives a particular blaze thanks to luck. We might have a change of wind, it cools down at night, and the fire might not grab that patch of forest, said Arjan Meddens, a fire ecologist at the University of Idaho and lead author of the BioScience review. But when researchers look at satellite images from other years, they see that some refugia are different. There are some places in the landscape that seem to avoid fire time and time again, said Dr. Krawchuk. The most interesting thing is why, she added. What makes that green spot stay that way? There are probably many factors at work. In the Northern Hemisphere, the north sides of mountains favor refugia. The plants there get less sunlight that their south-facing counterparts. They often hold more water in their trunks and roots, and they grow in moister soil that can tamp down fires. Fire refugia dont have to endure for centuries to be ecologically important. Even a fleeting shelter can be important for local biodiversity.","The Delta Fire burning in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California last month.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Fire engulfs Glasgow School of Art. Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the fire which has gutted Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art as ""heartbreaking"". Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. ""My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" The Mackintosh library was destroyed in the blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. It was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to £35m. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. About 50 firefighters were still tackling Friday's blaze with nine fire engines and four-high reach appliances at the scene. A spokesman said the blaze had now been largely contained, however, a few pockets of fire remained. Image copyright PA Image caption The art school building has been devastated by the fire Image copyright Police Scotland Unlike four years ago, art students were not using the now fire-ravaged building for their degree work. An exhibition by graduating students took place at the nearby McLellan Galleries and the school of art's Reid Building. A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" Fire crews are concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes have been evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. SFRS area manager David Young said: ""The fire has now largely been contained but this remains a protracted incident and our efforts very much continue at this stage to extinguish the fire and ensure the community is protected. ""There will be disruption around Dalhousie Street, Sauchiehall Street and Renfrew Street and I would advise the public to avoid these areas at this present time. Firefighters sent to the scene had been faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said earlier. All floors of the building were affected. Image copyright PA Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze, resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. The morning after Graham Fraser, BBC news website Image copyright Getty Images Parts of Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street look normal for a Saturday morning. The rain falls heavily on top of chip boxes, the remnants providing breakfast for many a hungry bird. But the presence of fire engines, police officers, bewildered passers-by and an acrid smell of smoke in the air indicate this is far from normal. Smoke still billows from the Glasgow School of Art, the Campus nightclub and the O2 ABC venue, with all the streets around the area closed. Once again, the people of Glasgow are watching on as one of its most famous buildings is on fire. Once again, the words ""so sad"" are heard on every corner. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said. Media caption Glasgow School of Art 'extensively damaged' At the scene Aileen Clarke, BBC Scotland Water is still being pumped onto Glasgow School of art this morning, though firefighters now say they have contained the blaze which has so extensively ravaged the Mackintosh building there may still be pockets of fire flaring up. The operation on the ABC building next door they still describe as active firefighting, the fire spread to the roof of that building though it's smoke more than flames visible from the street, now. Deputy assistant chief fire officer Peter Heath says there is damage to every part of the Mackintosh building, and the fire had such a grip of the building when they arrived here just after 23:15 last night, that they don't know where it started let alone how. Initial impressions are that it seems unlikely that any of the restoration work carried out since fire ripped through the building four years ago, will have survived this latest blaze.

Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, who had visited the building only two weeks ago, said he was ""devastated"". He said the government ""stands ready to help, financially or otherwise"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said ""hard questions"" needed to be asked as to why and how the building has suffered two serious fires in four years. He said: ""In the meantime, we can be relived that there appears to have been no serious casualties."" The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland. In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011.

Sidney Fussell,"Comcast is once again under fire for injecting JavaScript code into websites its customers visit. Last week, user bham3dman took to the Xfinity forum to complain about Comcast inserting hundreds of lines of code into their browsing session. The code surfaced a pop-up telling them to upgrade to a new modem. This is far from the first time Comcast has taken heat for secretly injecting code into devices on its network. In 2014, the company got called out for pounding wi-fi hotspot users with pop-ups, and the modem-upgrade pop-ups first surfaced early last year. But the company’s response this time around only added fuel to the simmering flames. “I just learned of this dispicable [sic] Comcast practice today and I am livid,” bham3dman wrote. Comcast’s solution? The user should have checked their email spam folder. A Comcast representative —who, it turns out, is Comcast’s vice president of policy and standards, Jason Livingood —confirmed the code injection, pointing bham3dman to a 2011 white paper outlining the practice. Titled “Comcast’s Web Notification System Design,” the document interestingly has a clause specifically saying injecting code is permissible but not for advertisements. R3.1.12. Advertising Replacement or Insertion Must Not Be Performed Under ANY Circumstances Additional Background: The system must not be used to replace any advertising provided by a website, or to insert advertising into websites. This therefore includes cases where a web page already has space for advertising, as well as cases where a web page does not have any advertising. This is a critical area of concern for end users, privacy advocates, and other members of the Internet community. Therefore, it must be made abundantly clear that this system will not be used for such purposes. Livingood, who confirmed to Gizmodo that he responded to bham3dman, insisted to the user that the pop-ups aren’t ads at all. He instead said they were notifications alerting users that their modems were “either end of life (EOL) or that you are about to get a speed upgrade that the model will be unable to deliver.” The specifics of the language is important: Simply notifying users they have a faulty modem isn’t the same as enticing them to upgrade to a new one for no reason. One could be considered a mere notification, while the other would be a forbidden ad. Motherboard surfaced one of the modem pop-ups when similar complaints came up last year. The message links to Comcast’s My Device page. Clicking through links to a list of modems you can purchase via Amazon. A Comcast spokesperson told Gizmodo that the company also offers customers the option to rent a modem from the company. On the question of whether this qualifies as an ad or not, bham3dman called bullshit. Livinsgood said the messages only show up if your modem is dead or dying, but bham3dman said they’d been assured by Comcast’s own support team that their modem was perfectly fine, neither end-of-life nor incapable of handling increased speeds. Further, when bham3dman reached out to customer service supervisors to complain, the user said, most had never heard of the practice of injecting code or, if they were aware, didn’t know how to turn it off. Incredibly, Livingood suggested it was all bham3dman’s own fault: “The notice is typically sent after a customer ignores several emails. Perhaps some of those ended up in your spam folder?” Creepily invasive code-injections aside, for a telecommunications giant to say, in 2017, that pop-up notifications are unavoidable is absurd. No one can stop the notices? If they’re triggered by ignoring emails, can’t the trigger be disabled? And why send emails in the first place, when the user has been assured they have a fully functioning modem? Livingood, who declined our request to further comment on the pop-ups, was careful in his replies not to debate whether it’s actually fair to users to send them messages this way, but that’s the real issue here. If this is meant to help customers, it’s as self-serving a way to do it as possible—and it could be dangerous. As Motherboard noted, using these types of pop-ups can train users to be less vigilant about pop-ups, which hackers can use for malicious purposes.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Palestinian health ministry said thousands of protesters were hit by live rounds Palestinian health officials say more than 100 Palestinians have been killed and 10,000 injured by Israeli troops over the past six weeks at a series of protests along the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Sixty died on Monday alone, when 40,000 took part in demonstrations that coincided with the controversial relocation to Jerusalem of the US embassy. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel's military of carrying out ""massacres"" of unarmed civilians, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted its troops acted in self-defence and blamed the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, for the deaths. Fierce exchanges over Gaza killings What has happened at the protests? Image copyright Reuters Image caption The protesters demanded that Palestinian refugees be given the right of return Hamas and other groups organised the protest campaign, dubbed the ""Great March of Return"", in support of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in the war which followed Israel's founding in 1948. The Israeli government, which has long ruled out any right of return, said terrorists wanted to use the protests as cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. Before the protests began, Israeli officials said soldiers would be permitted under certain rules to fire live ammunition at anyone attempting to damage the border fence, and even against people coming within 300m (985ft) of it - a figure that was reportedly later reduced to 100m. Image copyright EPA Image caption The Israeli military said ""rioters"" had thrown stones and firebombs at its troops Despite the warnings, thousands of Palestinians approached the fence during the protests. A number threw stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers deployed on the Israeli side of the border, and flew kites laden with petrol soaked material intended to start fires on Israeli territory. Israeli troops responded by firing tear gas, rubber bullets and various types of live ammunition. Gaza border violence in pictures What do human rights groups say? They have accused the Israeli military of using excessive force. They have said Israeli soldiers deployed near the Gaza protests were required to operate according to the international legal framework applicable to police and other law enforcement officials, which is part of international human rights law. It holds that the ""intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life"". Image copyright Reuters Image caption The United Nations has called for independent investigation into the violence ""An attempt to approach or crossing or damaging the fence do not amount to a threat to life or serious injury and are not sufficient grounds for the use of live ammunition,"" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters on Tuesday. ""This is also the case with regards to stones and Molotov cocktails being thrown from a distance at well-protected security forces located behind defensive positions."" Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East director, said: ""This is a violation of international standards, with Israeli forces in some instances committing what appear to be wilful killings constituting war crimes."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption At least 13 children have been killed and hundreds injured since the protests began Last month, the group documented witness testimony, video and photographic evidence that it said showed Israeli troops were killing and maiming demonstrators who posed no imminent threat to them. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said the open-fire orders were ""manifestly unlawful"" and called on Israeli soldiers in the field to refuse to comply with them. Last month, six other human rights groups asked the Israeli Supreme Court to revoke the military's rules of engagement that they said permitted live fire at protesters classified as ""key agitators"" even when they did not pose an immediate threat to life. The groups said soldiers should instead follow the law enforcement framework. The court's decision is pending. What does Israel say? Image copyright Reuters Image caption Israeli soldiers were deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier Lawyers for the Israeli government argued before the Supreme Court that the military's rules of engagement along the Gaza border were ""in keeping with Israeli and international law"". They asserted that the demonstrations along the border were ""part of the armed conflict between the Hamas terrorist organisation and Israel"". The military's open-fire orders, they said, were therefore subject to international humanitarian law - also known as the law of armed conflict - rather than international human rights law. Mr Netanyahu said on a Monday that Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008, had declared that ""it intends to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal"". ""We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and citizens."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Israeli military used drones to spray tear gas at protesters gathered near the fence The Israeli military has insisted that its troops have acted ""according to standard operating procedures"" when confronting Palestinians ""partaking in violent riots"". ""We resort to live fire only when absolutely necessary and when there is clear threat to infrastructure or to Israeli soldiers. If there is, then we use snipers who fire specifically and under very clear guidance by commanders,"" spokesman Col Jonathan Conricus said last month. The military has said it also foiled a number of ""terrorist attacks"" orchestrated by Hamas during the protests and killed people trying to plant bombs at the fence or break through it. Image copyright AFP Image caption Hamas leaders visited the protest sites and encouraged people to try to breach the fence On Tuesday, the military said it had evidence that at least 24 of the 60 people reported killed the previous day were ""terrorists with documented terror background"", including many ""active Hamas operatives"". Hamas acknowledged that five of those killed on the first day of protests in March belonged to its military wing, saying they were protesting ""side-by-side with their people"". But it has refrained from acknowledging the deaths of any other members at subsequent protests. Why is the legal framework so important? Noam Lubell, a professor of international law at the University of Essex, said human rights law required a graduated approach to the use of force - starting with no force, on to minimal force, and reaching lethal force only in the context of imminent threats to life. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security forces are not permitted to open fire on civilians if they are only demonstrating The law of armed conflict, he added, contained a different set of rules, some of which could allow in certain circumstances for direct recourse to lethal force against particular individuals, including combatants in wars and civilians directly participating in hostilities. However, it does not entitle security forces to open fire on civilians if they are only demonstrating. Professor Lubell said that if the Israeli military was operating under the armed conflict model along the Gaza border, then it might argue it was only targeting individuals taking a direct part in hostilities. But he added: ""There would still need to be legal scrutiny to see how they have interpreted taking a direct part in hostilities - was it construed to include only individuals attempting to use weapons or explosives, or was it anyone coming near the fence? The latter would seem too broad of an interpretation to allow for direct lethal force."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Israeli troops detained three Palestinians who tried to approach the border fence on Tuesday And even if the law of armed conflict was applicable in this situation, while it might allow for lethal force against members of armed groups operating from within the crowd, as far as civilians taking part in a demonstration - including a ""riot""- are concerned, the expectation is still that any force used towards them would be based on the law enforcement framework in international human rights law. Additionally, if the armed groups are using the civilian crowds for cover, that could in itself be a violation of international law on their part. However, even if that is the case, it does not remove the civilian protection from demonstrators entitled to it. Professor Lubell said there was also the question of whether, given that the protests did not come as a surprise, more could have been done by the Israeli military in advance to minimise the use of deadly force - something both international human rights law and the law of armed conflict require. These recent events also cannot be divorced from the larger picture of the situation in Gaza, which itself raises many legal questions with regard to who has the power and obligations to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the territory.",Israeli troops have been criticised for using live fire in response to Palestinian protests in Gaza.,2018-05-16T09:29:27Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44124556,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5F30/production/_101586342_mediaitem101586338.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fire,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright WYFF Image caption News channel WYFF 4 paid tribute to its two journalists Two journalists were killed in a ""freak of nature"" accident while covering weather conditions in North Carolina during storm Alberto. Mike McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer, from news outlet WYFF, died when a falling tree crushed their car as they drove down a highway. Fire chief Geoff Tennant had recorded an interview with the pair minutes before he received the emergency call. He said they had each exchanged wishes to stay safe just 10 minutes earlier. Mr McCormick was a reporter and anchor, and Mr Smeltzer was a photojournalist. Both were on assignment covering the extreme weather. The tree, Mr Tennant said, ""probably fell in excess of 30 feet"". While the deaths of the two journalists are not being directly attributed to the storm itself, the heavy rainfall had waterlogged the soil, probably contributing to the tree's fall. ""It is one of those things you know is going to happen, or you can predict it may happen - you don't know when,"" Mr Tennant said. He said the death of both men has ""personally affected me"", and that although it was his first meeting with Mr McCormick and Mr Smeltzer, ""you feel a sense of responsibility for them"". The news station which employed both men paid tribute to them in its reporting. ""Our news family grieves over the loss of two special journalists - and two special friends,"" news anchor Carol Goldsmith said as she reported the news on WYFF 4's evening news. Mr McCormick was an anchor and reporter covering the Spartanburg area with more than a decade's experience in the role. Mr Smeltzer had joined WYFF this year from local competitor station WSPA. In their own story on the tragedy, WSPA 7's anchors said: ""The journalists who died in today's crash were friends to many of us. ""They were committed to their work, to this community, and while we are of course competitors on air, Mike and Aaron were our friends and they were part of our larger journalism family. ""We will miss them both terribly."" Viewers also sent in their messages of sympathy after the news was broadcast. Subtropical storm Alberto is the first named Atlantic storm of 2018. It made landfall on Florida's north-western coast on Monday, which was also the Memorial Day holiday in the United States. It has since weakened to a subtropical depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph (55km/h) and sustained heavy rainfall, the US National Hurricane Centre said.",Two journalists are found dead by the fire official they interviewed just 10 minutes earlier.,2018-05-29T08:48:58Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Storm Alberto: Journalists killed while covering US storm,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44287035,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162B9/production/_101790809_deuvrfnv4aa6uod.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fire,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Three days ago, ties between the US and Iran took a significant turn for the worse. Donald Trump pulled the US out of a multi-country deal that suspended sanctions on Iran while limiting its nuclear activities. After saying the deal was ""defective at its core"", he placed more sanctions on Iran. Iran responded with frustration, but it now appears to be engaging in a more off-the-cuff manner. On Friday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was pictured in a post on his Instagram feed at the Tehran Book Fair. Nothing unusual there, but in one image he was seen reading a Persian-language edition of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury. The subject of which, of course, is the chaos inside Mr Trump's White House. When the book was released in January, it was described as a ""bombshell"" by commentators as it raised doubts over Mr Trump's mental health. It claimed Mr Trump said he pursued his friends' wives, that his daughter Ivanka would mock him, and that the US president would eat cheeseburgers in bed. The US president described the book as ""fiction"" and Mr Wolff as a ""fraud"". The photo was posted just days after Iran's President Hassan Rouhani appeared to troll the US in the wake of Mr Trump's decision to pull out of the deal. The deal with Iran's government was signed by Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. It was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. On Wednesday, Ayatollah Khameni said Mr Trump had ""made a mistake"" in deciding to leave a multi-country nuclear deal. ""I said from the first day: don't trust America,"" Mr Khamenei said.

ELIZABETH D. HERMAN,"The quiet, desolate feeling during the day belies the conflicts magnitude. Despite a cease-fire, shelling and gunfire persist, especially at night. The difficulty of moving around, both because of limited transport and frequent fighting, makes it hard for people on the Russian-controlled side to cross into Ukraine to get their pensions, which for many is their only source of income. A recent landmark decision by the Supreme Court of Ukraine may change the need to travel to receive a pension, though the rulings effect is unknown. Worse, many older people have limited mobility because of declining health. For those who stayed behind, the results are tangible. They live with stress and in squalor, with many unable to maintain proper hygiene. Ms. Bronsteins work shows how this unending stress and trauma affect the body through premature aging, reduced immune function, and increased inflammation and hypertension. Bronstein heard that nine out of 10 elderly residents die not from violence, but from stress-related ailments, like heart attacks. Some extended family members in towns not far away visit only sporadically because of the conflict; they cannot afford to have the older generation move in with them. But others simply do not want to leave. Many of the elderly, Ms. Bronstein said, are essentially waiting to die in the homes where they have always lived, close to relatives who might be buried nearby.","Varvara Arkhipovna, 81, lives alone on a small pension in Katerinovka, Ukraine.
