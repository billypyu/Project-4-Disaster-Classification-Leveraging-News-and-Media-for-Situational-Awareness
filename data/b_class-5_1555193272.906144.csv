Devin Coldewey,"Tesla has paid out $5 million to settle a class action lawsuit against it alleging that the Autopilot feature in the company’s cars was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” Owners who paid $5,000 for Autopilot will be reimbursed to the tune of a couple hundred bucks, Reuters reported. Although Tesla claimed that the semi-autonomous driving software would improve safety and reduce the possibility of collisions, it was in practice erratic and unreliable. “Contrary to what Tesla represented to them, buyers of affected vehicles have become beta testers of half-baked software that renders Tesla vehicles dangerous if engaged.” A series of crashes that took place while Autopilot was active didn’t help dissuade anyone of that, though Tesla has maintained that the feature has improved safety overall. It also continued to update the system, bringing it closer to its original promise, but those improvements have taken a great deal more time than users were told to expect. Ultimately it was those delays in achieving the promised functionality that Tesla admitted were worth compensating the class members for. The settlement proposal was sent several weeks ago (and intercepted by Electrek ) and yesterday the plaintiffs filed documents saying they had agreed to it and as such would be dismissing the lawsuit as soon as the court permitted it. Consumers who paid for Autopilot before January 24, 2017 will receive $280, and the number decreases steadily the later people bought their cars or paid for the upgrade. The smallest amount is $20, hardly worth cashing in, but that’s the nature of class action suits. In a statement, Tesla emphasized its continual improvement of the Autopilot system, but acknowledged the need to pay back customers (including those outside the U.S., who technically aren’t part of the suit) for the inconvenience: Since rolling out our second generation of Autopilot hardware in October 2016, we have continued to provide software updates that have led to a major improvement in Autopilot functionality. That said, as time passed since we first unveiled Hardware 2, it eventually became clear that it was taking us longer to roll out these features than we would have liked or initially expected. We want to do right by those customers, so as part of a proposed settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit filed last year, we’ve agreed to compensate customers who purchased Autopilot on Hardware 2 vehicles who had to wait longer than we expected for these features. Although the settlement is specific to customers in the US, if it is approved by the court, we’ve decided to compensate all customers globally in the same way. There’s no legal obligation to do so, but it’s the right thing to do The settlement still has to be approved by the court, but there doesn’t appear to be any reason to think it won’t be.","Tesla has paid out $5 million to settle a class action lawsuit against it alleging that the Autopilot feature in the company’s cars was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” Owners who paid $5,000 for Autopilot will be reimbursed to the tune of a…",2018-05-25T17:26:39Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Tesla settles class action suit over Autopilot claims for $5M,http://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/tesla-settles-class-action-suit-over-autopilot-claims-for-5m/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/tesla-autopilot.jpg?w=599,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-5,1
Emily Price,"Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging. Even more challenging is finding activities your child wants to do that for your family’s schedule. KidPass is a mobile app that works in major cities sort of like ClassPass does for gyms, except instead of pilates and yoga the events are all things like swimming lessons, art classes, and trips to the zoo. The idea is that you don’t have to sign up to commit to a particular activity without knowing if your child is going to like it, and you can do a variety of different things each month. So, you can try art lessons and if it’s a hit come back, or if it’s not, swap it out for karate or a trip to the museum the next week. Using the service requires a mobile app. A Basic plan is $49 a month and includes 10 “activity credits” that will translate into 2-3 activities during the month (some events require more credits than others). Super active parents can get 50 activity credits for $189 a month. Credits roll over from month to month for 90 days, so if you go on a vacation or just get busy one month you don’t lose them. The number of activity credits something takes varies. A swim class at the YMCA might set you back 3 credits in a month, while a music class with a smaller group might be 5. The subscription is month-to-month, so if you know things are about to get hectic or you’d rather sign up for that art class exclusively, you can bail. On a basic level, it can be a good resource for finding new things to check out near you, especially if you have a child who tends to like to try a variety of activities rather than just one, or your family has one of those schedules where another regular weekly commitment just won’t work.",Finding kid-friendly activities that your child actually wants to do can sometimes be a bit challenging.

Google Home Max, as mentioned, costs $399 and comes in charcoal and white with both Chromecast and the voice-controlled Google Assistant. That's $100 less than the Sonos Play:5, which doesn't have either of those two features.

Roberto Baldwin,"The NVIDIA system can tackle an impressive 320 trillion operations per second. All the parties involved in this new venture hope this will be enough to power level 4 and 5 vehicles which will be used as robo-taxis. Daimler and Bosch announced back in April they would be teaming up to develop self-driving taxis. The two companies had said they wanted to get these vehicles on the road within five years. With today's news, it looks like they're on track with that. The first of the cars using NVIDIA's AI platform (which the Daimler says will be Mercedes S-Class sedans and V-Class vans) will start road testing in a Silicon Valley city starting in the second half of 2019. The two companies are still negotiating with the city and will announce the location at a later date. The final version (or at least ready for a larger general rollout) should be ready in the first part of the next decade. A bit vague timeline wise, but within the goal already set forth by the two companies. In addition, to supply the self-driving AI platform, NVIDIA will work with Bosch and Daimler to build the system necessary for the self-driving ride-hailing service. During the pilot phase, the shuttles will stick to a few predetermined routes. We should start seeing more pilots like this one in the coming years. Waymo already has an Early Rider program up and running in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Uber, Lyft, GM and others are all working towards their own self-driving taxi services. With the initial cost of level 4 and level 5 vehicles being beyond the reach of most consumers (because of the sensors and technology embedded), it makes sense financially to have these cars act as taxis where they'll be able to recoup the tech investment. Daimler noted that it's Mercedes division has been working on a foundation for autonomous driving for a while. That includes last year's Intelligent World Drive. The data gathered from that event and the subsequent research done in its wake will help the partnership build parameters for cars in each market. This isn't the first time Bosch and Mercedes have teamed up for an autonomous car. Back in 1986 they were both part of the Prometheus project that included an autonomous car codenamed VITA (Vision Information Technology Application). Except this time they're going to have to move a whole lot faster because if mobility plays out the way automakers think it will, being one of the first to have a ride-hailing system on the road could be very lucrative.","Putting self-driving cars on the streets requires a lot of computing power.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Zero exercise is not enough. Going for a walk every day is probably a good thing. And if you’re training for a marathon, you’ll be on your feet for a couple hours of hard workouts every week. But what is the benchmark for a human being just trying to squeeze enough healthy exercise into their life? Let’s break it down. It’s easy to feel motivated about the idea of exercising. Let’s all run marathons! And do a push-up … Read more Read Fortunately, all the major public health organizations are in agreement. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association are all on board with the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise like walking, ideally broken up into 30 minutes per day over five days 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise like running, ideally in three 25-minute chunks It only counts if you do 10 minutes or more in each session, and you should spread your sessions throughout the week (so, you can’t take a single 90-minute spinning class and figure you’re done.) If you’re a stroll-around-the-neighborhood person, go with the first recommendation. If you enjoy hard workouts, but would rather not change into your gym clothes every day, you can just go with the 75 minute recommendation. And feel free to mix and match. Here are some possibilities: Walk 15 minutes to and from work every week day (5 x 30 minutes = 150 moderate) Go running on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, each for 2-3 miles (3 x 25 minutes = 75 vigorous) Take a 90-minute heart-pounding cycling class, and go for a walk after dinner at least a few other days of the week (1 x 90 minutes = 90 vigorous, plus perhaps 3 x 15 = 45 moderate) Go for a 30-minute easy bike ride on Monday. Try a 45-minute water aerobics class on Wednesday. Take a short hike on Saturday. Mow the lawn for an hour on Saturday. (30 + 45 + 30 + 60 = 165 moderate) If you’re confused about what counts in each category, the UK’s National Health Service has a list of “moderate” and “vigorous” activities here. I love long walks and runs, but I tend to not too many of them for one reason: I get bored. Walking … Read more Read If you’re pretty athletic, the above won’t sound like much. Good news! The WHO has set a secondary goal for folks like you. It’s simple: just do double the above. So you can aim for 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity: Two of those killer 90-minute classes, Monday and Thursday A three-mile run every weekday An hour-long martial arts class three times a week...or, to meet the requirement with moderate activity, you can stroll for an hour before breakfast each day, the favorite activity of spunky grandmas and grandpas who will probably never die. (To be fair, the recommendations we’re talking about are for people up to age 65.) So, what about an upper limit? There isn’t one, from a public health point of view. More is better. (And even if you are doing less than the recommendations, anything is better than nothing.) That said, it is possible for you as an individual to do more exercise than your body is ready for. Don’t jump from a life of occasional strolling to a marathon training plan. And if you are on that marathon training plan and you’re feeling worn down, take a break already. Strength, Flexibility, and More So far we’ve been talking about aerobic exercise, which is the kind where you’re continuously moving (or, perhaps, doing quick work/rest intervals) and your heart rate is up. But there are other important forms of exercise, too. The WHO and other organizations recommend two days per week of “high intensity muscle strengthening activity,” which includes anything where you’re thinking in terms of sets and reps. (Three sets of eight to 10 reps is a good structure to start.) So, your workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps for this exercise, 3 sets of 8 after that, and—oh,… Read more Read That activity can be anything that challenges your muscles, and where the 10th rep is a lot harder than the first: lifting weights, or resistance band exercises, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups. So if you run three days per week but have time for more, don’t just fit in extra runs; try adding two days in the weight room instead. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends two other kinds of exercise you might otherwise forget: Two to three days per week that include stretching, ideally spending 60 seconds stretching each major muscle group. This can be in a few short stints of 10-30 seconds each. Two to three days per week that include neuromuscular training. Think of this as hand-eye coordination and its full-body equivalents. Anything involving balance, coordination, or paying attention to your gait fall into these categories. Both of these can fit into your other workouts. Stretching works well in a cool-down session after your main workout, or some people prefer to put it into a warm-up. If you’re doing functional movements like lunges that challenge your balance and coordination, you’re working on neuromuscular fitness.","Zero exercise is not enough.

Bryan Menegus,"The Supreme Court, as you may have read, gave its opinion today on Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis and, in a 5-4 split, decided to uphold forced arbitration agreements that preclude employees from pursuing class-action lawsuits against their bosses in court. Neil Gorsuch penned the majority opinion, so join me in opening a window and shouting “ fuuuuuuuuuck yooooouuu Neiiiiiill” four or five times, or until you pass out. Whichever feels better. Essentially the case weighed the Federal Arbitration Act against the employee rights-focused National Labor Relations Act—two pieces of legislation nearing their 100th birthdays. The former won, and the meaning of that victory was deftly put by Justice Ginsberg in her dissenting opinion : the inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers. It’s a dreadful blow to all workers regardless of their grievance. A even though the NLRA protections do not apply to contractors, the ruling has brought a swift and sorry end to a tactic popular among those engaged in the gig economy. “The effect of today’s decision will be to end misclassification class actions, for Gig Economy workers and for everyone else,” Larry Peluso, an attorney who filed one such suit on behalf of Lyft drivers less than two weeks ago, told Gizmodo via email. Employees and wrongfully-categorized “contractors” are in the same boat. “This decision lays the final stone in an almost impenetrable barrier to group action to redress all unlawful employer practices, whether in court or in private arbitration,” he wrote, “the class action aspect of all these cases cannot proceed.” Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney famous for her representation of Uber drivers, explained the grim future of redress in this space: “Gig workers will need to sign up with a lawyer to do an individual arbitration. There are fewer lawyers who will be willing and able to handle individual arbitrations for a lot of workers.” Not only are there fewer firms willing to do the work, but according to employment lawyer Michael Subit, it’s often prohibitively expensive. “If you’re a low-paid worker, the cost of arbitration will most of the time outweigh any potential recovery,” he told Gizmodo by phone. “For a low-wage worker a thousand dollars or a few thousand dollars is a significant claim, but not in the context of [the] high cost of the legal system.” He predicts the outcome of the SCOTUS decision will be, “fewer cases brought, less enforcement, and more examples of people simply not being paid what the law says they should.” “The Supreme Court’s decision acknowledged that this result might not be the best policy but left it to Congress to make the decision to change it if it chooses,” Liss-Riordan added. And maybe a Congress in the future will, but almost certainly that change will not come with this Congress, or with this president. Now gig workers and their legal representation are left to come up with new strategies.","The Supreme Court, as you may have read, gave its opinion today on Epic Systems Corp. v.

If you’ve got a fitness tracker or a sleep app, it should tell you how much you’ve been getting. If not, here’s your basic guideline: in your teens you needed eight to 10 hours a night ; in your early twenties it’s more like seven to nine. Get schoolwork out of the way early The number one reason I pulled all-nighters in college was “Oh shit, I forgot that was due tomorrow.” The number two reason was “I knew this was due tomorrow, but I kept pushing it off until * checks watch* tonight.” If you’re commuting to school and working a job or three, life gets in the way.

So make sure you know when stuff is due, and work backward to figure out when your butt needs to be in the chair: “this will take me so-many hours, and I have this many days...” Keep an eye on your upcoming obligations, both short and long term. I’m not saying you have to get everything done before it’s due, but try to have some of the work already taken care of before you sit down for your all-nighter. Use caffeine as a tool, not a way of life If you’re not used to caffeine, and then you drink a giant cup of coffee late at night, it will keep you awake and your mind nimble for hours, possibly all the way until morning. That’s kind of the ideal way to use it. But if you have coffee every night, and every morning, and some energy drinks in the afternoon (or even a Coke, which has caffeine as well), it won’t work as well anymore when you need to use it. You’re dulling your sharpest stay-awake tool. Have you ever found yourself chugging coffee to stay up late studying, but then when it’s time for… Read more Read If you find you need caffeine all the time, for example just to stay awake in class, it means you haven’t been getting enough actual sleep. (Return to the step, above, where we talked about scheduling your sleep and staying ahead of schoolwork.) The magical caffeinated all-nighter is a powerful tool if you use it occasionally: a few times a semester, tops. Not every week, okay? Keep your phone out of bed Even if you use a night mode on your phone or laptop, pointing your eyeballs at a light source is a way to keep you awake. It’s not just about the light, either: whatever you’re doing on your phone (playing games, getting angry on social media) is keeping your brain awake too. I am the absolute worst at this. I know I have to go to bed at a reasonable time, but when… Read more Read So if you charge your phone by your bed, here’s what happens: you’re exhausted, you flop onto your pillow...and then you spend the next hour doing whatever the heck it is you do on your phone when you actually mean to be sleeping. Nobody wakes up and says “man, I wish I had an extra hour of Youtube last night.” So plug in your phone in a place you can’t reach it from bed. If you need to be able to see the time during the night, get a clock, or set up an app to display it dimly all night. Just keep it out of bed. Make your room a sleepy place A lot of sleep hygiene for adults centers around making the bed feel like a nice, comfortable, sleepy place. If you’re exhausted all the time, though, you’re likely to fall asleep as soon as you give yourself the chance to close your eyes. But you still don’t want disruptions waking you up, or (like your phone) tempting you to delay bedtime. The right furnishings and decor can turn your bedroom into a relaxing retreat and help you get a… Read more Read Have a chat with your roommate(s) about when all the light and noise should settle down for the night. If you’re in a dorm with a quiet hours policy, that should help. If there’s a quiet hours policy but nobody enforces it, go talk to your RA. They’re probably trying to walk the line between enforcing the rules and being a nice guy who doesn’t get up in people’s business. Let them know you actually want them to enforce the rules for once, and you’ll help shift that balance a bit. Have a wake-up routine on weekends If you want to be able to wake up for a Monday 8 a.m. class (or even a 9 a.m., or 10 a.m....) it’s best not to sleep in super late on the days you don’t have class. If you’re signed up for an 8am class, ideally you’ll be getting up at 7 (or whatever allows you to get there in time) every day. (This is a good reason not to sign up for 8 a.m. classes.) I find it doesn’t mess up your schedule too much to sleep in late one day a week, so maybe have a later alarm Saturday mornings but try to keep the rest of the week the same. The idea of waking up early, sitting down to breakfast, and writing a few pages in a journal sounds … Read more Read That doesn’t mean you need to hop out of bed raring to go every Sunday. Instead, make yourself a nice wake-up routine. Maybe bring your blanket to the couch to watch TV, and make yourself a cup of tea. Something calm and relaxing, so long as your eyes are open. Make it something you want to do, and before you know it you might actually enjoy keeping a semi-reasonable sleep schedule.","The feeling I associate most with my early college days is exhaustion.

ELLEN RUPPEL SHELL,"It’s a cruel irony that a college degree is worth less to people who most need a boost: those born poor. This revelation was made by the economists Tim Bartik and Brad Hershbein. Using a body of data, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes 50 years of interviews with 18,000 Americans, they were able to follow the lives of children born into poor, middle-class and wealthy families. They found that for Americans born into middle-class families, a college degree does appear to be a wise investment. Those in this group who received one earned 162 percent more over their careers than those who didn’t. But for those born into poverty, the results were far less impressive. College graduates born poor earned on average only slightly more than did high school graduates born middle class. And over time, even this small “degree bonus” ebbed away, at least for men: By middle age, male college graduates raised in poverty were earning less than nondegree holders born into the middle class. The scholars conclude, “Individuals from poorer backgrounds may be encountering a glass ceiling that even a bachelor’s degree does not break.” The authors don’t speculate as to why this is the case, but it seems that students from poor backgrounds have less access to very high-income jobs in technology, finance and other fields. Class and race surely play a role. We appear to be approaching a time when, even for middle-class students, the economic benefit of a college degree will begin to dim. Since 2000, the growth in the wage gap between high school and college graduates has slowed to a halt; 25 percent of college graduates now earn no more than does the average high school graduate. Part of the reason is oversupply. Technology increased the demand for educated workers, but that demand has been consistently outpaced by the number of people — urged on by everyone from teachers to presidents — prepared to meet it. No other nation punishes the “uneducated” as harshly as the United States. Nearly 30 percent of Americans without a high school diploma live in poverty, compared to 5 percent with a college degree, and we infer that this comes from a lack of education. But in 28 other wealthy developed countries, a lack of a high school diploma increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent. In these nations, a dearth of education does not predestine citizens for poverty. It shouldn’t here, either: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 20 percent of American jobs actually require a bachelor’s degree. By 2026, the bureau estimates that this proportion will rise, but only to 25 percent.","For the poor, higher education may hurt more than it helps.",2018-05-16T19:08:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",College May Not Be Worth It Anymore,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/opinion/college-useful-cost-jobs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/16/opinion/16shell/16shell-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Because flying wasnt quite unpleasant or expensive enough, four major domestic airlines have increased their checked bag fee in 2018, including American, Delta, JetBlue and United. While the exact prices often vary by destination, when you add amenities (for example, some carriers will charge more if you dont reserve your seat or add a bag during the online check-out process), the different tier of flying classes and, in the case of baggage, weight, deciphering all of the fees youre going to pay can be difficult. And it might become even more confusing MarketWatch reports that Congress is considering repealing the the so-called full fare advertising rule, which requires a carrier to quote a ticket price that includes all taxes and fees.

LISA FRIEDMAN,"Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, is facing scrutiny for his travel at taxpayer expense. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times The chairman of the House Oversight Committee — in a prominent instance of Republican scrutiny of the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt — demanded on Wednesday that the E.P.A. chief turn over documents related to his first-class travel at taxpayer expense. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, called on Mr. Pruitt to detail all his government travel since assuming leadership of the E.P.A. one year ago. He raised a particular concern over conflicting statements from Mr. Pruitt’s press office about whether the administrator had a waiver to fly first class at all times. Representative Trey Gowdy has asked that Mr. Pruitt’s travel information be handed over by March 6. Credit Al Drago for The New York Times “Clearly, federal regulations prohibit a blanket waiver to fly first class except to accommodate disabilities or special needs,” Mr. Gowdy wrote in a letter. “Instead, a waiver is required for each flight in order to fly first or business class when traveling on official government business.” Mr. Pruitt has been under fire for his travel since The Washington Post reported that he routinely flies first or business class, and that he and top aides had spent more than $90,000 on airfare in the first few weeks of June alone. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., initially issued a statement that said that Mr. Pruitt had a “blanket waiver” to fly first class out of concern for his security. Mr. Wilcox later amended that to say that the E.P.A. did in fact submit a waiver for each trip. According to the General Services Administration’s regulations for travel by federal employees, “blanket authorization” of anything other than coach-fare travel is barred except for reasons related to a disability or special need, and authorization for first-class travel is given on a “trip-by-trip” basis. Mr. Pruitt has long been a target of criticism from Democrats, who last week asked the E.P.A.’s inspector general to expand an existing investigation into the administrator’s trips. But the issue of first-class travel has also struck a nerve with a handful of Republicans. “I’m surprised at the expense of it,” Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said in an interview last week. “Good stewardship of the federal dollar is important to me, and it should be to him.” Mr. Gowdy asked that Mr. Pruitt’s travel information be handed over by 5 p.m. on March 6. Mr. Wilcox on Wednesday declined to comment on Mr. Gowdy’s letter, saying in an email, “We will respond to Chairman Gowdy through the proper channel.”","Scott Pruitt’s taxpayer-funded travel at the E.P.A. has drawn criticism, resulting in a Republican committee chairman to issue a demand for documents.",2018-02-22T01:44:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Senior Republican Calls for E.P.A.

Saqib Shah,"SpaceX hasn't confirmed the mission, but its hailing the feat as a major step toward making spaceflight affordable and accessible. ""We're turning this into routine access to space,"" proclaimed SpaceX's Lars Hoffman at the Wernher von Braun Memorial Symposium on Wednesday. ""We've launched Falcon 9 over 60 times,"" said Hoffman, adding: ""We've landed our first stage booster 30 times now. And relaunched 16 times. We're about to relaunch a booster for the third time. High-reliability, higher-performance, lower-cost access to space; that opens it up to everybody."" The fact that SpaceX is gearing up for a third launch for its booster in the span of a year certainly lends credence to Hoffman's statement. It also brings the company one step closer to orbital-class reusable rockets and lays the foundations for future trips to Mars. The plan is to use the final ""Block 5"" design for 10 launches before it needs to be looked at and restored, and for a staggering 100 launches in total.","SpaceX is gearing up to launch the final Falcon 9 rocket design for the third time, just months after reusing it to blast off a satellite to geostationary orbit.

Image: Pexels This is a great course for people who are curious about the fashion biz and people who always had a passion for starting their own clothing line but didn't know where to begin. By the time you complete the class, you'll know the basics. You'll have the foundational elements of fashion and business. This lecture-based course will help you understand how to identify your customer base, walk you through the design process, assist you with business planning, and help you get started with manufacturing. The class is broken up into the following sections: Creating a clear business plan Looking at your company's projected financials Performing research on the rest of the market that you are in Creating your line and building your brand Finding vendors and manufactures What you'll need: You'll need to have Adobe Illustrator already installed for sections that teach you how to draw fashion flats. Cons: This course does not teach fashion drawing or sewing, which many fashion enthusiasts see as key elements of design. But it can help you understand how to start your business using the right tools. Image: Udemy Even though it seems every industry is going digital, there's nothing like having the ability to actually sketch your garments by hand. The instructor of this fashion illustration course will show you step-by-step how to draw a fashion figure in unique and interesting poses. You'll go over fashion portraits and how to use watercolors along the way. What you'll need: The professor says you can use whatever illustration tools you prefer, but suggests the following: Fabriano Watercolor Paper (Hot Press) Pentel Brush Pen Sakura Micron Ink Pen Mijello Mission Gold Watercolors da Vinci Watercolor Brush Porcelain Palette Bonus: The student feedback for this course is awesome. The class has an average 4.5 out of 5 stars. The professor herself has been rated 4.4 out of 5 as well, so I'd say the class is a pretty safe bet. Image: udemy Pattern cutting is an essential part of the design process and the instructor of this class says she's been a pattern maker for over a decade, working with high-end fashion designers in London. This video lecture course will teach you how to take a 2D illustration and turn it into a 3D wearable garment. This course is ideal for fashion students, enthusiasts, hobbyists, as well as industry professionals who are seeking to advance their sewing skills. What you'll learn: Pattern cutting basics Equipment required Basic garment construction Necklines and Seems How to sew a basic shift dress How to sew simple pencil dress What you'll need: You'll need a basic bodice block and pattern making materials. You'll also need equipment to help you with fabric cutting. Critique: Some 56 percent of students give the class 5 stars but of the ones who didn't enjoy it, a few cited that some of the lectures are a bit repetitive. However, no matter when you want to be in fashion, it never hurts to know something about garment construction. Image: udemy It seems like everybody has a t-shirt business these days. But don't let the Instagram likes fool you, it takes time and skill to produce a line of tees that is actually profitable. Designers need to use high quality fabrics because people can buy t-shirts anywhere for relatively low prices. The instructor of this course wants to help teach you how to start and what things to keep in mind. If you're a newbie who wants to start an online business *or* if you already make your own tees but want to learn how to market them, this course is probably for you. What you'll learn: How to make a plan and do research How to choose printing method for your business Production Sales and Marketing What you'll need: For this course, all you need is an internet connection and a willingness to learn something new. Critique: What's great about this class is it teaches you the good stuff. It discusses issues with running a design business as well as how to assess your competition. The instructor has a 3.2 rating which isn't all that great, but odds are, you'll leave the class learning something you didn't know before. Image: Pexels So, you have a cool collection that you want the world to see, now what? Start here. This course was designed to teach you how to set up a photo shoot as well as ways to connect with your customers using social media.

What you'll learn: Branding Setting-up photoshoots Social media tools Creating your slogan Keywords Hashtags Online community Reviews: The instructor has taught almost 3,000 students and has an average rating of 4.1, which is pretty good. Students call her class ""excellent"" and ""straight forward,"" however some expressed difficulty understanding the instructor's French accent.","Ever dreamed of being on Project Runway, but never actually touched a sewing machine or needle in your life?

All the while, Prodger's deeply personal voiceover recalls her coming out in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in the early '90s and people being unable to tell whether she is a boy or girl. ""It ends up being so unexpectedly expansive. This is not what we expect from video clips shot on iPhones,"" said Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, who chaired the judging panel.

Previous nominees have included an interactive computer simulation of Osama Bin Laden's hideout and Tracy Emin's infamous unmade bed, which lost out to Steve McQueen's collection of film pieces and visual installations in 1999. In the past, Apple's smartphones have been used by filmmakers to shoot feature films, most notably Sean Baker's Sundance hit, Tangerine, and Steven Soderbergh's paranoid thriller, Unsane, starring Claire Foy from Netflix's The Crown.

DAVE PHILIPPS,"In the past two months, lawyers have seen a stark uptick in troops getting discharged after being notified they have failed background checks. Ms. Stock said it could be a result of an effort to clear the backlog. Private Second Class Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant, was discharged this spring after enlisting in the Army Reserve two years ago. He has sued the Defense Department. Credit Calixto Family, via Associated Press Recruits say they are not told why they failed background checks and have no way to appeal. One Pakistani immigrant, worried about the long wait, was able to get his security report in May through a Freedom of Information Act request. The report noted the immigrant, an electrical engineering student recruited to repair generators, had dreamed of moving to the United States since he was 5, and had an American flag cover on his cellphone. The recruit, the report stated, “has such a deep and longstanding loyalty to the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.” “I jumped for joy, I was literally dancing when I read this because I knew there would be no problem,” said the recruit, who asked not to be named because he fears he could be harmed in Pakistan if he is deported. In June he was told he had failed his security background check and was being discharged. “I cried,” he said. “I feel like I have been kicked out of my own home.” Private Second Class Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who moved to the United States with his parents when he was 12, was discharged this spring after enlisting in the Army Reserve two years ago. Since enlisting, he had been going through drills regularly in Massachusetts, where his unit had supported him, he said.","A ceremony for Mavni recruits in 2009.

Megan Rose Dickey,"A U.S. District Court judge has just handed some Uber drivers a win by concluding the ride-hailing company breached a contract pertaining to “Safe Rides” fees. In U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers’ opinion on damages, she wrote “there is no question that drivers were financially harmed by Uber’s breach of contract.” The lead plaintiffs, Matthew Clark, Ryan Cowden, Dominicus Rooijackers and Jason Rosenberg, sued Uber for $5 million in 2016 on behalf of 9,602 drivers who opted out of arbitration. However, the exact extent of the damages has not yet been determined. The plaintiffs alleged Uber, despite saying it wouldn’t, took the “Safe Rides Fees” from the fares drivers charged riders on minimum fare rides between April 2014 and November 2015. The plaintiffs specifically alleged Uber breached its contract with drivers. In her order yesterday, Rogers granted the drivers’ motion for summary judgment, saying, “Nothing in the Agreement provides a formula for Uber to deduct $1.00 from the Minimum Fare and then deduct another 20% from the balance. The fact that Uber chose not to follow the precise terms of the Agreement for the 19 months of the class period and is now attempting to rationalize its conduct is not relevant to the instant claim.” She added, by Uber taking out the $1 Safe Ride fee from the minimum fair before paying drivers, the company “breached the plain terms of the Agreement.” Judge Rogers also ruled all Uber drivers who signed a 2013, June 2014 or November 2014 agreement — or some combination of three — opted out of arbitration, and completed at least one minimum fare ride for UberX when the Safe Rides Fee applied before Nov. 16, 2015 are eligible to be part of the class. Uber first added the $1 safe ride fee in April 2014 to help pay for its safety program, which includes driver training, background checks and vehicle inspections. But it wasn’t until November 16, 2015, the lawsuit alleges, that Uber updated its terms to notify drivers the fee would be taken from their minimum fares. Here’s a key nugget from the original complaint: After instituting the Safe Rides program, Uber’s Service Fee Schedules and published local fare webpages continued to show the fares that riders would pay, including a minimum fare, for each area. Consistent with its contract and its emails to drivers, those schedules and fare webpages also showed the new Safe Rides Fee as a separate surcharge for riders. Until approximately November 2015, nothing in Uber’s contract, schedules, emails, or fare webpages suggested that drivers would pay Uber’s Safe Rides Fee out of the driver’s own fares. Despite the clear terms of its written contracts including Uber’s incorporated emailed promises that it would not do so — Uber took its Safe Rides Fee charges out of the drivers’ fares when drivers charged riders minimum fares. In other words, when a driver provided a minimum fare ride, Uber did not charge the Safe Rides Fees to the riders (as a separate surcharge), but, instead, charged that fee to the drivers by taking it from their fare. This win for drivers comes a couple of years after Uber settled with riders over the Safe Rides fee. In 2016, Uber made a $28.5 million settlement with riders, who alleged in a class-action lawsuit that they should not have had to pay the fee because the company’s background checks were misleading and not “industry leading,” as Uber had previously claimed. The lawsuits also cited “unfortunate incidents” that had happened to passengers during Uber rides. I’ve reached out to Uber and will update this story if I hear back.","A U.S. District Court judge has just handed some Uber drivers a win by concluding the ride-hailing company breached a contract pertaining to “Safe Rides” fees.

Leigh Anderson,"Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold! For some people, the first freeze of winter is doubly depressing—we’re close to the shortest day of the year, which means we’re not getting a good dose of sunlight, and it’s too cold to go outside and get some exercise and fresh air. But don’t despair! Winter can be a season for hibernation, sure, but if you’re clever and plan ahead, you won’t necessarily start climbing the walls. This AskMetafilter question was posted by a user with mobility issues who hates the forced confinement of freezing temps, and commenters chimed in with many useful suggestions on how to weather the winter with one’s good spirits intact. Below are the indoor-entertainment possibilities that resonated the most with me, but definitely check out the whole thread for even more ideas. 1. Deal with your house In my family, the run-up to Christmas causes me a certain amount of mild anxiety. I know a deluge of new gifts for my kids is coming, and it feels like that water level in our cramped apartment is rising. So take a few evenings or a weekend and cull your closets, shelves, and that pile of stuff by the door (we all have one). Or redecorate a room or sew some new pillow covers or build a bookcase. I know that nothing makes me feel more accomplished than painting a room and hauling a load of stuff to the Good Will. Sprucing up your living space provides a sense of satisfaction; it also just...spruces up your living space. Which is nice when you’re trapped there. For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read 2. Get active for a cause Is the current political environment making you antsy? Do you want to use your time to help other people? You’re not alone. And even if you can’t go door-to-door and attend meetings, you can still do a lot of good work online or on your phone. VolunteerMatch will help you find volunteer opportunities in fields that interest you, and you can filter the results by “virtual opportunities.” (Note—it doesn’t filter perfectly, so you have to read carefully. But there are still lots of chances to help out with web design or admin support for organizations getting off the ground.) If you already have a favorite nonprofit or political candidate, contact them directly and ask how you can help from home. 3. Get completist about a subject This winter I want to learn to play a certain fiddle tune on the guitar in all 12 keys. Will I actually complete it? I doubt it. But by April I might make it through four keys, which is still better than the zero keys I know it in now. I’m also planning a personal mini-class on the Civil War, complete with the Ken Burns documentary and a few thick books already on my nightstand. By the spring I’ll basically have a Ph.D. 4. Host Make people trudge through the snow to you. Put on a pot of stew, bake some bread, and break out the whiskey. How do you think that people in cold climates stay social? Winter is back, and it's colder than ever. Coupled with snow, dry air, sickness, and… Read more Read 5. Get a penpal Postcrossing is something I’ve never heard of, but it seems to be a way to have short correspondences, via postcard, with people all over the world. There are also sites that will match you with more traditional pen pals (check this post out for safety tips before you start). 6. Take an online class Want to bone up on your art history, your calculus, your knife technique? Google around for virtual instruction in whatever subject is grabbing you. I’d probably try some kind of write-your-novel class that would force me to turn in a certain number of pages each week, but there’s obviously a huge range of subjects to choose from. If you live in a snowy place and you don’t have a hot water bottle at the foot of your bed, I’m… Read more Read 7. Proofread Project Gutenberg needs proofreaders for their scanned books. You get to read and help distribute great works of literature at the same time! And of course there are the old cold-weather standbys, like cooking, crafting, and playing music, and the new cold-weather standbys, like video games and social media. Do you have a novel way of getting through a hard winter without losing your mind? Let us know in the comments!","Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold!

AJ Dellinger,"Telsa agreed this week to a settlement in a class action lawsuit filed against the company by buyers of Tesla vehicles who alleged the company semi-autonomous, assisted driving feature was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” The terms of the agreement, which have yet to be approved by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, will require Tesla to place more than $5 million into a settlement fund. The fund will provide Model S and Model X owners with compensation for the faulty feature, according to Reuters. As with most class action suits, the agreement won’t pay out a whole lot to the actual members of the class. Reuters reported Tesla owners bought or leased cars with Enhanced Autopilot between October 2016 and September 2017 will be eligible receive between $20 and $280 in compensation—a small fraction of the $5,000 they paid for a feature that was “completely inoperable,” per the complaint. When the class action suit was first filed back in April 2017, Tesla vigorously fought back against the charges, calling them “disingenuous,” “inaccurate,” and “sensationalist.” The company seems to have changed its tune since then, calling the settlement an attempt to “do right by those customers” in a statement to The Verge. The company stated it has made “major improvement in Autopilot functionality” since rolling out the second generation of the feature in 2016 but acknowledged it “became clear that it was taking us longer to roll out these features than we would have liked or initially expected.” While the Autopilot class action suit applies only to Tesla customers in the United States, the company said if the settlement is approved, it will extend the compensation plan to “all customers globally in the same way.” Autopilot has been one of Tesla’s signature features, a calling card that the company has played up considerably. The company has claimed the feature can reduce crash rates by 40 percent—a statistic that has been challenged recently. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated “the probability of an accident with autopilot is just less.” Consumer advocacy groups have started pushing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla for “deceptive and unfair” practices while marketing Autopilot. Despite lofty claims and promises of new features, Tesla has failed to deliver on much of the promise of Autopilot. The feature has at times gone months without updates and has come under fire recently for potentially playing a role in accidents, including being active during at least two crashes that resulted in the death of the drivers. Telsa has recently made promises to improve upon Autopilot. On Twitter, Musk admitted that Autopilot “certainly needs to be better” and said the company works “to improve it every day.” The CEO also committed to releasing quarterly safety updates for the feature during Telsa’s most recent earnings call.

David Randall,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With bond and equity markets from the United States to emerging markets all on pace to lose money this year, investors have not seen this much red on their screens since 1972, the last time no asset class returned at least 5 percent. Yet fund managers are finding things to like despite the recent market volatility, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 2 percent this week. As they start to position their portfolios for 2019, fund managers, from firms including ValueWorks, Sierra Investment Management and Federated Investors, say they are looking at sectors that could snap back next year thanks to a combination of more attractive valuations and a decline in the dollar. Such a rally in both fixed income and equities markets would not be unprecedented. A 20 percent decline in the value of the dollar pushed the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 38 percent in 1995, while the U.S. bond market returned nearly 17 percent the same year following one of the worst fixed-income bear markets in memory. “If you look out at the broader picture, a lot of things are going right,” said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management, citing strong consumer confidence and other economic indicators. “It’s easy to make a bull case because the economy is humming along just fine, but the market is nervous because the headlines are really loud and no one likes the unknown,” she said. Part of the yield curve inverted this week when yields on 5- year Treasuries dropped below those on both the 2- and 3-year securities, a signal that has preceded every U.S. recession in recent memory by between 15 months and 2 years. Yet the long delay between a yield curve inversion and a full recession can still be a profitable time to invest, said Charles Lemonides, founder of New York-based hedge fund ValueWorks. “I don’t buy the thesis that the economy is slowing, but I do believe we are late in the cycle. We’re going into a period where investors are getting a little fooled by the headlines and avoiding names that have excitement,” he said. As a result, Lemonides has increased his long exposure to companies that have sold off, including battered semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc ( MU.O ), whose shares are down 37 percent over the last six months, and iPhone maker Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), whose shares are down nearly 23 percent over the last 3 months. At the same time, Lemonides has increased his short position on defensive stocks like consumer staples companies Clorox Co ( CLX.N ) and Church &amp; Dwight Co Inc ( CHD.N ), which have benefited from the market volatility. Chad Oviatt, director of investment management at Huntington National Bank, said his firm has been increasing its allocation to U.S. large-cap stocks in anticipation that declining bond buying by the European Central Bank and a resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions will derail the rally in the dollar this year. That should improve margins for U.S. exporters. A Reuters poll of 60 currency analysts that ended Dec. 5 forecast that the dollar will be weaker against major currencies next year, with most of the declines coming in the second half of 2019. Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager of several value-oriented funds at Federated, said the recent stock market volatility has made stocks, including Apple, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co ( JPM.N ), Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) more attractive at a time when the U.S. economy continues to look stronger than either Europe’s or China’s. Low oil prices, continued job growth and strong consumer spending will likely prolong the U.S. economic expansion well past next year, she said. “If the markets were to close for the year today, people would go into 2019 thinking that there are more opportunities given the valuations,” she said.

They’re supposed to guide you through workouts that are right for you, teach you how to do exercise safely and properly, and develop a meal plan that will help you reach your fitness goals. One fitness pro, who wished to remain anonymous, explained that a lot of people go to the gym, but most of those gymgoers don’t know what they’re doing: The Dunning-Kruger Effect seems particularly strong in the gym, probably because of all the ego involved. So many people don’t know what they’re doing, and they have no idea this is the case. Others know enough to see decent progress, but they could be doing better. A personal trainer can at least jump start a beginner’s knowledge and give them resources to move forward. Gym-goers waste a lot of time with bad advice and poor sources, or trying to reinvent the wheel. It’s all about imbuing you with knowledge you can use to better yourself when they’re not around. The hard work has be done by you, not your instructor, says Anthony T., a fitness trainer from Oakland, CA: You don’t pay a trainer to have fun. If anyone knows your journey isn’t easy it’s your trainer, and they didn’t become one overnight. So leave the excuses in your bed. Positive and inspirational energy is the key. Another anonymous instructor agreed, saying: Don’t blame your lack of success on me. You meet with me once a week for 1 hour a week. There are 168 hours in a week. That means that if you really want to make progress you have to do things correctly 167 other hours of the week. Don’t come kill it in the gym with me then go home and eat a whole pizza and drink a bottle of wine and complain that I am not a good trainer. Nobody is going to make you exercise, not even your trainer, so don’t expect them to have some magic ability to get you motivated. Our February push-up challenge ends today! How did the month go for you? What can you do now that… Read more Read You Should Do Research and Shop Around for a Good Fit When you’re looking for a trainer, don’t just sign up with the first person to give you a free session. Michael Borders, a personal trainer at Equinox in New York, NY, says you should find someone who can help you achieve your specific goal: I believe we all could use a different perspective on our fitness goals and be held accountable to someone else—not just our own opinion of what we can and cannot, should and should not be doing in the gym. YouTube is full of BAD info. Shop around, but find a trainer who is passionate about getting you to your goal, whatever it may be. But several fitness pros cautioned that you should do in-depth research on certain trainers before signing up with them. One anonymous trainer pointed out that almost anyone can get a certification: The personal trainer certification is not a rigorous process. There are many certified trainers who have little business instructing others. Some do the bare minimum to pass the test, and then don’t further their education beyond that. Other trainers have a passion for this and they read a ton. It’s important for potential clients to know what to look for in a trainer. Some are very good and knowledgeable, others spread misinformation and taint the industry. Allison Perry seconds those words of caution: Good, knowledgeable fitness instructors are hard to find. There are a LOT of people out there with little to no training (or who flat-out ignore their training recommendations) teaching fitness classes. A lot of gyms don’t even require an audition, or the audition process is a joke. Do some investigating for yourself and find out what qualifications the gym’s instructors have. At the bare minimum, your instructors should have an AFAA or ACE certification as a base, and then any specialty trainings that correspond to what they are teaching. AFAA and ACE also require ongoing continuing education in order to remain current in the certification. However, she goes on to say that a lot of popular specialty fitness certifications are a joke. All they require is that you show to an 8-hour class, so keep that mind when a trainer starts bragging to you about all of their certifications. And if you’re checking out classes, Perry offers some useful advice: Pay attention to how a class is structured. Does the instructor seem organized? Does the music work with the format? Are you getting enough cues? Is the workout balanced (e.g., are you working opposing muscle groups, is the instructor allowing for adequate recovery between sets, etc)? If you try a class and didn’t care for it, consider giving it a go with another instructor. They may have a different personality, music, cues, etc that change the game for you. Last but not least, a few trainers mentioned that a trainer who looks amazing isn’t always the best option. You’re probably better off with someone who is knowledgable and has gone through the same struggles as you. Bouncing on a trampoline is undeniably fun, but how well does that translate to an exercise class?… Read more Read Don’t Be Late to Your Appointments or Classes This should be obvious, but many trainers expressed late clients as their biggest pet peeve. Here’s what one anonymous trainer had to say: For the love of everything, show up on time to your appointment. Good trainers have a plan, and showing up 15 minutes late can throw a wrench into that. Or, at least let us know you’re going to be late. Nothing like a client showing up late and then expecting an hour session crammed into 45 minutes. There is a method to the madness and it doesn’t work like that. Perry echoes those sentiments: Really, I know shit happens, but try not to be late, especially for formats that require setup. For example, if you’ve never taken a Spinning class and you are about to walk in 5-10 minutes late, just skip, make plans for next time, and try to get there early — properly setting up your bike is a process that takes a few minutes and will prevent you from injuring your joints with a bad setup. Anthony T. notes that being late is really only hurting you: When you are late, unprepared, or reschedule often. You’re wasting your own time, money and progress. At the end of the day this whole process is a test of your mental way more than A test of your body. We want to repeat the things to you that will manifest successful thinking. Budget plenty of travel time, leave early, and be ready to roll come training time. Manage Your Expectations Going in It’s great that you want to make a change for the better and be healthier, but it’s a process—and not an easy one. Anthony Ross, an Army Master Fitness trainer, explains: People need to come prepared when they want to work out. I don’t mean that they should have a towel, a trendy water bottle, and some yoga pants. I mean that you have to train your heart and your mind to UNDERSTAND that working out is going to suck for a little while if you haven’t done it in a long time, or if you have never done it. People tell me it’s hard, they are telling me like this is news. No shit! Of course it’s hard, I have to do this every single day, I know it’s hard. Not only is it difficult, but personal trainer Andrew Biernat from Canandaigua, NY, says it will take longer to reach your goals than you think: I wish people knew that the work they put in will fall far short of their expected results. I’d estimate that it takes five to ten times more work to get a result than people think. A person will make a change in their lifestyle and expect that to show up on the scale within a week. When it doesn’t they start to lose hope in the whole process. People can be very fragile when it comes to discomfort, especially when it comes to food and exercise. Biernat recommends you lower your expectations going in and learn to enjoy the process and the challenge. If you make yourself hate your new workout regimen and diet, you won’t do it. Rances Perez, of VIDAproject, agrees: In my opinion, the biggest thing that a person can understand before beginning is that training is a process with a learning curve. Many people start with very grandiose expectations of themselves and when the difficulty sets in—whether it’s the actual exercising, the obstacles of life, or both—they end up feeling horrible and defeated. The key is taking everything one step at a time and not trying to make drastic changes all at once. Stay positive, but keep your goals realistic. Don’t walk up to your trainer on day one and tell them you want washboard abs. You’ll only be disappointed. If you only do one of the sports in a triathlon—swimming, cycling, or running—you’re safe for now.… Read more Read It Might Look Like an Easy Job, But It’s Not From the outside, being a fitness trainer or class instructor looks like a pretty simple gig, right? Not so much. It’s a job, just like any other, and it takes a lot of work to do it right. At the very least, Anthony Ross asks you do your trainer the kindness of listening to what they say and following their instructions: Listen to your trainer, they may not always look like some dude from Baywatch, but they are a trainer for a reason. They know things that you don’t, so let them do their thing. Also, be aware that personal training is more than just showing up and watching you exercise. Andrew Biernat explains that they’re watching you for a reason: As a trainer, I need to know the body very well and be ready to correct something at a moment’s notice based on the way it looks, almost like a spider-sense. And that’s the easy part compared to the psychological deep dive of motivating and encouraging people to do hard work consistently. Also, they’re working for you when you’re not even there, says Scott Drapeau of Irons Sight Barbell Club in Lacey, WA: I’d like them all to know how much effort is put in behind the scenes. For every hour I spend training, I spend at least 3 more preparing notes, scheduling workouts, and making sure what you’re doing is safe and effective for your goals. So don’t ignore that effort your trainer is putting in, says Anthony T.: Yes, it can take hours to plan a perfect routine and meal plan, so don’t waste our efforts behind the scenes on distractions. Trust the process you’ll be happy you did. Lastly, Allison Perry says if you enjoyed a class or session, let your trainer or instructor know. Being a fitness professional is often a thankless job because people assume it’s easy to do. Be Honest With Your Trainers and Instructors You might be embarrassed by your physical ability, diet, or lifestyle choices, but lying to your instructors about that stuff won’t help you get healthier, says Anthony T.: We can’t train liars, and of course we can tell. If you have been sticking to your nutrition plan and fitness routine there’s no reason other than extreme stress for not achieving the steps to your goals each week. It’s my job to be critical and change your perception of your life when it comes to your health. Trainers don’t wake up to be mean to you. We’re actually Nice people who aren’t afraid to speak truthfully about your progress. We wake up to inspire you and locate that part of you that turns off excuses and starts finding solutions. If you’re new to all of this, don’t be afraid to say so, even in a class environment. Perry recommends you have a chat with your instructor before class so they know you’re new and might need some help. Ross agrees: If you don’t know how to do an exercise, or what an exercise is doing for you: ASK!!! It’s also important to be upfront with trainers about what you’re comfortable with. If you prefer to have them not manually adjust you while you exercise, let them know. And don’t hesitate to give your trainer a call, says Anthony T.: You can call your trainer anytime to vent, ask for health and fitness advice, or get motivation when you feel like it’s getting crazy. I’m even willing to think of a meal alternative to order if you got weak and pulled into a drive-thru. When in doubt, be honest and talk to them. This one is for the beasts out there.

"AP, AP","MILWAUKEE (AP) — New Mexico coach Bob Davie has been around college football long enough to understand the challenge that lies ahead for the Lobos. They beat FCS school Incarnate Word at home by 32 points last week in the season opener. They travel to No. 5 Wisconsin this week. Of course, Davie wants to win. He's also realistic. ""Well, the elephant in the room is I know what you're thinking,"" Davie told reporters this week. ""Incarnate Word to Wisconsin. Incarnate Word with 560 yards and now you're going to Madison, Wisconsin. Well that is the reality right there."" Incarnate Word averaged a whopping 7.7 yards per play against the Lobos, including 7.1 yards per carry. The Lobos now will face Wisconsin star tailback Jonathan Taylor, a Heisman Trophy hopeful running behind another behemoth line. Davie, in his seventh year at New Mexico, is just focusing on taking small steps forward. ""We know what (the challenge) is, but if you keep it in the context of just getting better, just individually get better,"" he said. ""It's a heck of an opportunity to get better in a big-time atmosphere."" For the Badgers, the New Mexico visit is the second of three winnable nonconference home games to start the season. They beat Western Kentucky 34-3 last week, though the Taylor-led offense didn't get off to a smooth start. It could be chalked up just to the inconsistencies that might accompany any season opener. After all, the Badgers ended up figuring out the early problems posed by the Hilltoppers' early pressure to take a three-touchdown lead by halftime. These kinds of early September games are meant to iron out any problems before Big Ten play begins in a couple weeks. Even the Badgers, with their vaunted offensive line, could improve in picking up blitzes. ""Absolutely, absolutely in a few different areas,"" offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph said. ""Like I always say about protection, everyone's got to be involved in it, and everyone's got to do a good job in helping each other."" THEY'RE BACK Wisconsin could get two projected starters back in tight end Zander Neuville (right knee) and defensive lineman Isiahh Loudermilk (left knee), who each returned to practice this week after being limited by long-term injuries. A senior, Neuville is the team's most experienced tight end and gives quarterback Alex Hornibrook another important target in the passing game. Loudermilk, a sophomore, played well off the bench last season. CHANGING UP One of the country's top rushing teams last season, New Mexico tweaked its offense this year to attack more through the air. Tevaka Tuioti threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns in the 62-30 win over Incarnate Word. It was the most touchdown passes in a game for a Lobo quarterback in 20 years. ""We're realistic about some of those plays that we made when we went over the top... and caught the ball probably won't be there"" against Wisconsin,"" Davie said. SECONDARY MATTERS Maybe throwing the ball isn't a bad idea to probe Wisconsin's young secondary, which features three first-year starters to go with senior safety D'Cota Dixon. The new alignment made a promising debut against Western Kentucky, especially fellow safety Scott Nelson, a redshirt freshman. The secondary needs all the on-the-job training it can get before conference plays starts. Coach Paul Chryst isn't downplaying New Mexico. ""I've been impressed with how they've learned it and understood it. It didn't look like the first game of a new offense,"" Chryst said. THAT'S SPECIAL One area in which New Mexico might have a historic edge is in the return game. The Lobos have returned at least one kickoff for a touchdown for eight straight seasons, including 10 over the previous six seasons. DEAL WITH IT Taylor had a nice debut last week with 145 yards and two long touchdown runs on 18 carries through three quarters. The Badgers also got a promising outing off the bench from backup running back Taiwan Deal. The often-injured senior is heathy again, running for 53 yards on eight carries against Western Kentucky. ""I had never seen Taiwan play in person in a game,"" Taylor said. ""They talked about how he was a physical runner. Now he's healthy and he got out there and you could see his physicality when he ran."" ___ AP freelance writer Dennis Semrau in Madison contributed to this story. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Adi Robertson,"Intel is facing at least three class action lawsuits over a recently revealed security flaw. The complaints, published by Gizmodo, were filed in Oregon, California, and Indiana by owners of Intel CPU-based computers. They allege that the vulnerability, which Intel learned about several months ago, makes its chips inherently faulty. Intel has helped provide security patches, but the complaints raise concerns that these patches will hurt computer performance, and aren’t an adequate response to the problem. Researchers revealed two major CPU bugs, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, earlier this week. The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel chips, and it strikes at the heart of how CPUs process information. Security patches offer a workaround, but The Register initially reported that they could slow down PCs by 5 to 30 percent, leading to widespread alarm. Intel has denied this, saying that “any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.” Since companies are still in the midst of rolling out patches, their practical effects are hard to measure. Intel isn’t the only chipmaker affected by this week’s revelations: the Spectre flaw is widespread and potentially more difficult to fix, and we don’t know how serious the problem might be in the long term. Google recently announced a patch with a “negligible” impact on performance, echoing Intel’s claims. Intel, meanwhile, says it’s now rendered Intel-based PCs “immune” to both Meltdown and Spectre, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see even more lawsuits filed in the coming weeks — whether against Intel or other manufacturers.","Suits have been filed in Oregon, California, and Indiana",2018-01-05T15:59:50Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Intel facing multiple class action suits over chip security flaw,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/5/16853732/intel-meltdown-spectre-cpu-vulnerability-class-action-suits,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x35sirSu4cTirHWOUI4gXMyhzCA=/0x86:1100x662/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1809623/PB283218.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-5,1
Bryan Menegus,"Two drivers have filed a class-action lawsuit against their employer, Waitr Holdings, Inc., alleging the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to meet minimum wage requirements. The suit also claims that some drivers had been misclassified as contractors while performing the work of employees.
The suit, which was submitted late last month to Louisianas Eastern District Court, claims Waitr did not reimburse its workers for mileage driven, a figure thats typically a little over 50 cents per mile. In total, they claim, this led to both plaintiffs being stiffed by around $260 per week. Waitrs systematic failure to adequately reimburse automobile expenses constitutes a kickback to Waitr such that the hourly wages they pay to Plaintiffs and the Putative Class Members was and continues to be below the minimum wage, the suit states.
In recent years, similar suits by contractors claiming theyd been asked to do the work of employees have been filed against other gig economy platforms such as Uber and Lyft, while food delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart have recently faced backlash for subsidizing wages with their workers own tips.
If the name Waitr doesnt ring a bell for those of you in New York or California, thats because it currently only operates in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. It scooped up similar upstart delivery service Bite Squad in Decemberwhich itself had acquired 18 other local delivery companieswhich covers much of the same territory, as well as Nevada, North Carolina, the Dakotas, Ohio, Virginia, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Washington, Iowa, Maryland, and Minnesota. Waitr also happens to be partially funded by football star Drew Brees and owned by Tilman J. Fertittabetter known as the owner of such disparate assets as the Houston Rockets and the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants.
Because this service operates outside the highly dense metro regions of the coasts, at least anecdotally, many drivers are putting considerable wear and tear on their vehicles. The gas reimbursement is a dollar an order but some orders are 5 to 10 miles away from the restaurant which can really cause problems when you have to fill up 4 to 5 times a pay period, one Bite Squad driver alleged on Glassdoor. Half of my pay ends up back in my gas tank.

Nala (Tanzania): A fintech service building internet-free mobile payments for Africa. Nala lets users pay bills, do p2p payments, and purchase cell phone minutes without an internet connection. The startup’s app is one of Google PlayStore’s Top Free Finance Apps in Tanzania, according to founder Benjamin Fernandes. Nala plans to leverage the seed funding and exposure from YC participation to raise additional capital to close its first seed round, he told TechCrunch.
54gene (Nigeria): 54gene aims to be the 23andMe for Africa. The company says that competitor data is limited because their users are mostly white. By focusing on Africa, the company can help detect and identify DNA markers that might otherwise go overlooked. Co-founder Abasi Ene-Obong has a PhD in cancer biology from the University of London.
VertoFX (UK): VertoFX is a B2B currency marketplace and international payment provider for frontier markets with an initial target market of Africa. The platform allows businesses to gain easy access to foreign currencies and make international payments seamlessly, providing clients with real-time and cheaper exchange rates, liquidity, and faster settlement periods. VertoFX’s founders are ex-bankers Anthony Oduwole and Ola Oyetayo. In an email to TechCrunch Oduu said there are currently 18 currencies on the platform and the ability to settle in 120 countries, including China and the U.S. 
Thrive Agric (Nigeria): The company helps smallholder farmers in Nigeria access crowdfunded loans to help grow their crops, as well as help them sell their produce. The company has worked with 14,000 farmers to date, with plans to reach 1,000,000 farmers across Africa by 2022 in what it says is a $54 billion market opportunity.
CredPal (Nigeria): A credit card company that allows consumers in Africa to make purchases across online and offline merchants and pay in fixed monthly installments. CredPal touts it cards as having the convenience of a credit card and the simplicity of fixed monthly repayments. The purpose is reducing the financial pressure faced by consumers in Africa and also improving their standard of living. The scope is Africa and it is currently operational in Nigeria. Founders are Fehintolu Olaogun and Olorunfemi Jegede.
Schoolable (Nigeria): Provides simple finance solutions for schools in Africa. There are 65 million students in Africa attending private schools, but tuition payments can be a pain point for parents paying for their childs education. Thats because tuition payments are often due upfront and its more difficult than it should be for schools to keep track of payments. Schoolable is creating an invoicing app that helps ensure parents make payments on time, while also using the app to save directly for tuition.
Wallet.NG (Nigeria): A fintech app that allows people to send money to friends or family and pay bills with only the recipient’s phone number. Wallet helps users keep track of their spending through financial reporting available on the app.","The seven African-focused companies which presented as part of Y Combinator’s 200 strong cohort of Winter 2019 class of 200 startups may seem like a small percentage for such a large class, but it represents the growing significance of African ventures in YC’…",2019-03-20T11:46:03Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Seven Africa-focused startups present at Y Combinator’s Demo Day,http://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/seven-africa-focused-startups-present-at-y-combinators-demo-day/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Y-Cominbator-Africa-Nala.jpg?w=419,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-5,1
Jordan Crook,"Fresh on the heels of the launch of betaworks Studios, the startup factory is opening its doors once again as applications have opened for LiveCamp. LiveCamp is the fourth installment of betaworks’ accelerator program, following the progress of BotCamp, VoiceCamp and VisionCamp. LiveCamp is a bit less straightforward with its thesis. Inspired by Twitch streamers and platforms like HQ Trivia, LiveCamp is looking for companies that are interested in digital live experiences, where the line between performer and audience is blurred. “You can think of eSports with commenting as the 1.0,” said Camps General Manager Danika Laszuk. “HQ really brought the idea of live to a more mainstream audience. I mean, there is no game if people aren’t playing it. But there are plenty of examples, like Peloton, where you could get a bike or go to a studio, or take a live spin class right from your home on your bike, with a community all over the world.” Betaworks has always employed the “rising tide” strategy. Even years ago, with the entrepreneur in residence program, betaworks created a cohort of companies across a single vertical to give them the opportunity for early strategic partnerships. LiveCamp will work in a similar way, with some companies focused on consumer-facing live applications, and others developing middleware to enable them, while still others will build applications to enable creators themselves. Betaworks is looking for between 5 and 10 companies to join the 11-week LiveCamp program. Each company will receive a $200K uncapped SAFE note with a 25 percent discount, with 8 percent common stock in each company allocated to betaworks. Companies can apply to LiveCamp here.","Fresh on the heels of the launch of betaworks Studios, the startup factory is opening its doors once again as applications have opened for LiveCamp.

JACEY FORTIN,"A yoga class had been scheduled to begin at the studio at 5:30 p.m., according to The Tallahassee Democrat. Seven people who were injured in the attack had been admitted to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare by Friday evening, said Danielle Buchanan, a hospital spokeswoman. She said that one had died, one was in critical condition, three were in serious condition and two were in good condition. (A couple of the people injured may not have been shot.)

ADAM LIPTAK,"A Supreme Court photographer also takes pictures. Until recently, the justices voted on which of those would be the official photograph. It is not clear when the justices began voting for their preferred pose, but the process goes at least as far back as the Taft court in the 1920s, Franz Jantzen, one of the courts photographers, wrote in 2015 in The Journal of Supreme Court History. If there were 5-to-4 splits, they have not been reported. The 2017 official photograph, according to notes to an exhibit at the court, included an innovation. It looks like a class photo, but it is a composite. This is the first official color group photograph for which color film was not used, the notes said, and the result is the first to combine each of the justices individual choices, from several poses, into a single image.

"afowler@businessinsider.com (A.C. Fowler), A.C. Fowler","Xu Shuhui is the only student at her school in China. INSIDER In China, a rural school had only one student. She studied with a single teacher, and usually learned and played alone. After the population of her village dropped, her parents couldn't afford to send her elsewhere, so she continued to attend school alone. Xu Shuhui was the only student in her gym class, math class, and music class. In fact, she was the only student at her school. In 2016, INSIDER reported that Fei'an Primary School used to have more than 300 students, taught by 50 teachers, but the population plummeted when families moved out of the mountains. Shuhui's parents couldn't afford to send her to a boarding school, so she worked one-on-one with her teacher, day in and day out — although sometimes, her teacher invited younger preschoolers to play with her, so she wouldn't be lonely. It's unclear if, two years after Reuters visited her school, she still attends alone. China has a population of nearly 1.4 billion people, the most of any country in the world. However, the population is unevenly distributed between urban centers and rural areas. Because of the dense population in Beijing and Shanghai, China went so far as to implement population caps on the two cities, both of which are home to more than 20 million residents. But that couldn't be further from what Shuhui experienced on a daily basis.

SAM ROBERTS,"Aiko Louise Yoshinaga was born on Aug. 5, 1924 in Sacramento to Sanji Yoshinaga and Shigeru Kinuwaki, immigrants from Kyushu, Japan. She moved with her family to Los Angeles in 1933. Shortly after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order in February 1942 forcing Japanese-Americans into camps, her high school principal summoned the 15 students of Japanese descent in her graduating class, she recalled, and told them: “You don’t deserve to get your high school diplomas because your people bombed Pearl Harbor.” Nearly 120,000 United States citizens of Japanese descent and legal resident Japanese nationals were evicted from their homes, mostly on the West Coast. After eloping with her boyfriend, she was bused 250 miles away to the Manzanar War Relocation Authority camp in Owens Valley, Calif., where she lived in a 20-by-25-foot space with three families in tar-papered barracks and gave birth to a daughter. The rest of her family was sent to the Santa Anita racetrack, northeast of Los Angeles, and then transferred to a camp in Arkansas, where her father died. After the war, she studied to become a stenographer, went through a divorce and joined her mother and four siblings in New York. There she married an Army officer and then moved to Japan, where he was stationed. When that marriage ended in divorce, she returned to New York, worked as a clerk, attended night classes at George Washington High School in Manhattan and received a general equivalency diploma.","Aiko Herzig Yoshinaga in 2011.

Kate Clark,"Women in tech are not only significantly under-funded by venture capitalists, but they also often lack access to the early-stage support granted to their male counterparts. To enroll in a startup accelerator like Y Combinator, for example, its expected founders relocate to the Bay Area for three months. Women, who are more often caregivers, might not be able to do that, and even if they can, the program may not cater to their specific needs. Female Founders Alliance (FFA), a relatively new network of female startup founders, has built a free, non-dilutive 5-week accelerator for women by women. Called ‘Ready, Set, Raise,’ its goal is to help more female-founded startups raise VC through workshops, 1-on-1 coaching, legal clinics, communications and speech coaching and more. The accelerator, sponsored by Trilogy Equity Partners, kicked off at the end of August and will culminate with a private demo day with VCs in Seattle on September 27th. “I don’t know many women who can uproot their families for three months to go live in another city,” FFA founder Leslie Feinzaig told TechCrunch. “When I was working on my company, I wanted to apply to Y Combinator but I was a new mom, it was 100% a non-starter.” Feinzaig knows the trials and tribulations of raising VC as a female entrepreneur all too well. As the founder of an edtech startup called Venture Kits, she tried, unsuccessfully, to procure venture backing. That struggle is why she started FFA, which began as a Facebook group to connect female founders in the Seattle area but has expanded across North America. The accelerator is designed to allow founders to tune into the programming remotely. Participants are only required to be on-site in Seattle, where FFA is based, for one week, during which the organization is providing free housing and childcare. FFA’s accelerator is among a new class of efforts created for women in tech. All Raise’s Founders For Change initiative, for example, and new female-focused funds, like Sarah Kunst’s Cleo Capital, are all working to close the gender funding gap. “I know it seems to people like there’s a lot happening around female founders and diverse founders, but in the context of the size and scale of that gender gap, we are barely getting started,” Feinzaig said. “We need all the accelerators. We need hundreds of funds. We are nowhere close to making a real dent in equal leadership.” Today, FFA is announcing their inaugural class of startups, eight in total. Here’s a closer look at the group: Chanlogic : Based in Seattle, the SaaS startup provides a product for e-commerce channel managers. Esq.Me Inc. : A Portland-based document marketplace for lawyers created by lawyers. Future Sight AR : A Houston-based AR product for engineering, procurement and construction companies. geeRemit : Based in Raleigh, the startup leverages the blockchain to power remittances to Africa. Magic AI : A Seattle-based AI startup for livestock care. MoxieReader : Based in New York, an edtech startup focused on improving child literacy through tech. Pandere Shoes : Based in Anchorage, the startup is creating expandable shoes.

Alex Cranz,"If the last week has led you to be wary of having an Intel CPU powering your PC then you might want to get excited, because it seems like AMD might have started actually making CPUs you’d want instead of having Intel inside. It started last year with the announcement of Ryzen desktop CPUs. We found them to be cheaper and faster than comparably priced CPUs from Intel. Then late in the fall AMD announced a new line of mobile-based APUs —which is what they call their CPUs with integrated graphics. The new Ryzen APUs used the same Vega architecture found in AMD’s exceptional and affordable desktop GPUs. AMD then got a lot more appealing over the last week, when a security vulnerability was found in a wide range of computer processors (including AMD’s). Intel is grossly affected by the vulnerability and has already been hit with a number of class action complaints regarding the vulnerability and the necessary hampering of CPUs in order to resolve it, but AMD has repeatedly claimed that it is significantly less affected. It is, according to AMD and computer luminaries like Linux creator Linus Torvald, simply more secure. And now there are more AMD CPUs to choose from than in years. Today AMD announced three new 15 Watt APUs for pro customers: The Ryzen 7 Pro 2700U, Ryzen 5 Pro 2500U, and Ryzen 3 Pro 2300U. 15W processors are the ones found in ultralight laptops, like your Dell XPS 13, Lenovo 720, your Asus Zenbook 3—though the Pro processors are likely to be found in more enterprise-like laptops like the Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad line ups. For people who don’t want the additional security features of the Pro line there are still the regular 15W Ryzen APUs, and besides the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 in that class AMD announced two Ryzen 3 APUs today: The Ryzen 3 2300U and Ryzen 3 2200U. The Ryzen 3 APUs are positioned to compete with Intel’s 15W i3 processors. Which means they’re likely to be found in the cheaper laptops made by manufacturers, and once upon a time that would have been a very expected and not very good thing for AMD. Traditionally, the company has sold cheaper CPUs that use more energy, so you’d find them in huge, cheap eyesore laptops built by OEMs (those are the computer makers). Mindful of that fact, AMD has designed its new Ryzen APUs so that their performance is, at least, partially tied to the design of the laptop. It’s due to an automated overclocking feature called Mobile Extended Frequency Ranger (XFR). The better the thermal design of the laptop, the faster and more energy efficient the processor. But AMD doesn’t just want to be in the cheap laptops that were once it’s bread and butter. It strongly feels its latest processors are more than capable of competing with Intel, and now it has to convince not just consumers, but computers makers as well. “The excuse the OEMs would always give is ‘but you’re not competing with an i7 or an i5 in terms of performance’,” Jim Anderson, Senior Vice President and General Manger of the Computing and Graphics Business Group at AMD, told Gizmodo. He was explaining why AMD APUs never appeared in the laptops of the same class and quality as those found with Intel inside. “But,” Anderson continued “we certainly are now.” Bragging about AMD’s line up of APUs, which have only just begun to roll out in laptops available to consumers and the press, Anderson said “As more and more Ryzen systems come to market you will see the best range of premium notebooks that you’ve ever seen from AMD.” In our conversation, Anderson seemed positively giddy over AMD’s plans for the coming year. Besides the Ryzen Pro line and two Ryzen 3 APUs, there’s also the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 APU currently available, and today AMD also announced two desktop APUs available February 12: The $170 Ryzen 5 2400G and the $100 Ryzen 3 2200G. These processors, according to AMD, are faster (and way cheaper) than the comparable desktop processors from Intel: the $200 Intel i5-8500 and the $130 Intel i3-8100 respectively. In fact the Ryzen 5 2400G, according to AMD, is so fast it can handle top tier games like Battlefield 1 and Witcher 3, at playable frame rates, without a video card. That’s simply not possible with the current generation of Intel CPUs. The graphics aren’t insane—AMD compares the Ryzen 5 2400G’s GPU performance to the $75 Nvidia 1030—but the graphics, at that price, certainly seems crazy good if AMD’s benchmarks are to be believed. And it’s difficult not to be delighted at AMD also continuing to use the nearly 18-month old AM4 socket for these processors to connect to the motherboard. That’s the same socket used with chips from AMD’s last microarchitecture, Excavator, as well as all currently available Ryzen processors, and the many Ryzen processors expected over the next handful of years. According to Anderson, AMD is devoted to the AM4 socket and doesn’t want to force people to upgrade their motherboard every few years, as is currently necessary with Intel’s processors. “We’re going to stick with AM4 for a long time,” he told Gizmodo. And that means that the second generation of Ryzen CPUs, which Anderson also mentioned today, will work with the AM4 socket as well. These processors, which are expected in the second quarter of 2018, are part of AMD’s super aggressive attempt to chip away at Intel’s hold on the CPU market. AMD didn’t go into too much detail, but did say the 2nd-Gen Ryzen processors would operate on a new Zen+ microarchitecture and that it would shrink from the 14nm that Zen is on, to 12nm. That’s a 2nm difference in just one year! Intel, for comparison, introduced its first 14nm processor in 2014, and it has repeatedly delayed moving to something smaller. Moreover, AMD has even claimed it will have a 7nm processor, the Zen 2, ready for market in 2020. That’s a crazy rapid pace of development for a company that’s spent the better part of the last five years completely stagnant. And it’s crazy exciting for consumers, because, as Jim Anderson repeatedly noted in his conversation with Gizmodo, AMD is finally able to compete with Intel. It’s not the slow and cheap alternative. It’s, potentially, the faster and cheaper alternative. Which means, if Intel, who is already hurting from this security snafu, doesn’t want to find itself playing second fiddle, it will need to step up its game, because if the performance of these new Ryzen processors are as good as AMD claims than I know I’ll be seriously considering a switch.

At some point during the high school tenures of so many, that pressure releases in the form of An Incident. And if you've ever wanted to read all of these stories, now you can.

So let's just, in this context, consider those stories rote. As opposed to these, which are fantastic : - Newton South High School, Class of '02, The Lewd Crude Scavenger Hunt: When your high school's ""Incident"" is insane enough to make the news of a website like The Smoking Gun, you know they've done something right. So goes Lindsey Weber's high school, which had a scavenger hunt so patently ratchet that it made national news. Among the hunted items: A brick from a rival high school (10 points), a bowling ball (5 points), a Mo Vaughn baseball card (5 points), and ""shit in a bag"" (10 points). And those are just off of the fake list they made to throw off cops. On the real list? Stealing the golden arches off a McDonald's (120 points), take a Viagra (5 points per pill, with a max-out of four pills), a license plate from a cop car (30 points), a left-handed baseball glove (5 points), a fish (7 points), and a "" Ghostbusters gun"" (10 points). And those are among the more, uh, printable items on the list. According to The Smoking Gun, half of Newton's 330 seniors got in on the action. This was apparently some kind of tradition that had gone on for some time—the resulting action was so madcap that director Eli Roth almost made a movie out of it, explaining: ""What started out as Cannonball Run quickly devolved into Caligula."" - Nyack High School, Class of '08, Giant Peen of Desks: When writer Sophie Kleeman went to high school, she saw an authorized senior prank go rogue when a bunch of kids were supposed to form a ""2008"" with desks and chairs removed from a classroom. Instead, they opted for (shocker) a giant penis shape. Said the local news : "" Seventeen-year-old senior Erin Cummings says it was upsetting to see her classmates' hard work turned into a huge penis even though many other students thought it was hilarious.

Ellyn Santiago,"Jackson County OR Jail ICE deportation officer Blake V. Northway, 55, is in jail on $1 million bail facing 10 counts of sodomy and one count of incest. Oregon State Police said the crimes are not related to his job. Oregon State Police arrested an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer on 10 first-degree sodomy charges and one incest charge. The sodomy charges are Class A felonies. Police said the offenses alleged “are not related” to his job. State police detectives arrested Blake V. Northway, 55 of Medford, Oregon on Thursday Sept. 13. State police said the arrest is a result of a joint investigation between its agency and ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Here’s what you need to know: 1. Northway’s Charges Stem From a 2009 Incident that Includes 8 Charges of Sodomy &amp; One of Incest. The 10th Charge is From a Few Days Ago, Court Records Show ‌ Based on the charges Northway is facing, and the dates of the occurrences, on March 13 of 2009 something unfathomable happened. In the State of Oregon case against Northway, records show a list of 8 separate counts of first degree sodomy with that date and a count of incest, a Class C felony, on the same date. Nine and a half years later, on Sept. 10, 2018, he’s accused once again of sodomy. Sodomy is generally understood to mean a particular sex act. But under Oregon law, it’s not quite that cut and dry. First-degree sodomy, a Class A felony, is among the most serious of sexual assault crimes. 2. Northway is Being Held on $1 Million Bond in Jackson County Jail. He Faces 200 Years in Prison if Convicted ‌ Northway is being held in the Jackson County lockup with a $1 million bond. He was arraigned on Saturday Sept. 14 and his next court appearance, the probable cause hearing when the evidence against him will likely become public, albeit with victim or victims’ names redacted, is Sept. 21. Per Oregon state laws, first degree sodomy is defined as “oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person or causes another to engage in oral or anal sexual intercourse commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree (when/if) the victim is forced, is under 12, is under 16 but related – “brother or sister, of the whole or half blood, the son or daughter of the actor or the son or daughter of the actor’s spouse” – or when the victim is “incapable of consent by reason of mental defect, mental incapacitation or physical helplessness.” If convicted of sodomy in the first degree, a Class A felony, Northway could face up to 20 years in prison and up to $375,000 in fines per conviction. He’s facing 10 counts, according to jail records. 3. Northway Was ‘Relieved of All Authority Pending the Results of the Investigation,’ ICE Said Despite Him Having Already Been Charged Twitter ICE deportation officer Blake V. Northway charged with 10 counts of first-degree sodomy. Authorities said Northway has been “relieved of all authority and will be placed on leave pending the results of the criminal investigation.” A deportation officer, Northway was assigned to the Medford, Oregon ICE office. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold its officers to the highest standards of professional conduct and does not tolerate those who violate the law,” ICE Public Affairs Officer Tanya Roman said. “ICE will continue to cooperate until this case has been resolved.” 4. Northway Attended High School in Guam, According to His LinkedIn. He Owns a House With Judith L. Northway in Medford ‌ Northway appears to be married to Judith L Northway and they own a house in Medford, Oregon, according to online property records. She has a Facebook page that is sparse and sans posts save for ones thanking veterans for their service. She is an accountant for the Veteran’s Health Administration in White City, Oregon earning $100,000 a year, records show. Blake Northway’s name has been removed from the list of federal government employees or is at least not easily located. ‌ Northway’s middle name is Villagomez and he has used Victor as what court records say is an alias. There is a person on social media with the identical name albeit far younger than the age of 55, it appears. There is at least one other younger family member with social media accounts. 5.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as theyre born: Should we red-shirt him? Will she be ready for kindergarten that soon? Red-shirting, which was originally coined as a term for college athletes who were kept from competing for a year to improve their skills and extend their eligibility, is now often used to describe the act of keeping a child from starting kindergarten for an extra year. Its most common with children who have summer birthdays or a birthday that falls very close to the school districts cut-off date. Whether it is truly at a childs advantage to be red-shirted is up for debate ; but now, a new study indicates that students born in August and who are among the youngest in their kindergarten classes are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Reporter Jenny Anderson writes for Quartz about the study, which was published this week by Harvard Medical School researchers. Heres how a childs birthday can shape their experience in school: Imagine you live in a school district with a Sept. 1 cutoff, meaning your child has to be five years old by Sept. 1 in order to start school. This means that a boy named Lucas, who turned five on Aug. 15, will enroll in the same class as Jack, who will turn six on Sept. 15. Jack has been alive almost 20% longer than little Lucas. Developmentally, this is an eternity. He will likely have better self-control and be better equipped to do the things required in school, like sitting still and listening for long periods of time. As children grow older, small differences in age equalize and dissipate over time, but behaviorally speaking, the difference between a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old could be quite pronounced, said study senior author Anupam Jena, an associate professor of Health Care Policy in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. What is normal for a five-year-old stands out as immature for six-year-olds. The study found that, in districts with a Sept. 1 cutoff date, kids born in August were 34 percent more likely than their almost-a-year-older September peers to receive a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD symptoms can include hyperactivity, inattention, difficulty sitting still, lack of focus or an inability to follow directions. Personally speaking, my husband and I red-shirted our son. He has a late-September birthday and in our school district, the cut-off date is Oct. 1. The closer we got to the time when we had to make a decision, the clearer it was that he would not be readyeither academically or emotionallyto transition from two hours of preschool four days a week to full-day kindergarten a month before he even turned five years old. And his preschool teachers made it clear that they couldnt have agreed more. Luckily, we had the option (and the financial means) to enter him into a preschool program specifically for kids in this situation; it was five days a week and more academically rigorous than the regular 4-year-old program (but less so than kindergarten). And even now, with my son thriving in second grade, I cant imagine he would be thriving in third grade if wed enrolled him a year earlier. But having a choice at all is a luxury many parents dont have. Many parents cant afford another year of daycare or preschool. And one parent in our Offspring Facebook Group felt forced into registering her son for kindergarten in order to keep a variety of educational services in place for him. He was receiving preschool therapies through a school district program for some developmental delays (gross motor, fine motor, speech). Those therapies expire at age 5 with the assumption that your child then continues the therapies through the special school district, says Jennifer, whose son turned five two weeks before the school districts cut-off date of Aug. 1. If I had made him wait a year, his therapies would have stopped and I would have had to pay out of pocket for three therapists for a year and then have him re-evaluated for school district therapies, which they could have rejected. So sending him to school and having him grandfathered into the school district therapies was the only solution that really made sense. Because other parents chose to delay the start of kindergarten, her son ended up in a class with a wide range of ages, which made her wonder: Would he look as far behind if everyone just went when they were 5? Or is he so much more delayed because half of these kids were lucky enough to be able to wait? Other parents in the Facebook group say they haveor still areconsidering everything from a childs social and academic skills to how their physical size compares to kids their age. Some parents factor in their personal experiences of being among the oldest or youngest when they were in school. Or there are some, like Matt, who are choosing what could be considered a compromise: Our current plan is to enroll in kindergarten and see how things go, Matt says. Worst case, he repeats kindergarten a second year. Every kid is different, so each parent needs to make the best decision for their family.","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as they’re born: Should we red-shirt him?

Petrana Radulovic,"Make no mistake, while Syfys latest series about a secret school for young assassins set in the 1980s might reek of Harry Potter and Stranger Things comparisons, Deadly Class actually has more in common with Mean Girls. 
Based on Rick Remenders comic book series of the same name, Deadly Class centers around Kings Dominion Atelier of the Deadly Arts, a secret boarding school for assassins. Marcus Lopez (Benjamin Wadsworth), a homeless orphan, is quite literally plucked off the streets by the students of Kings Dominion. Turns out the headmaster (Benedict Wong) has been keeping an eye on him after a mysterious incident at a boys home that we dont learn all the details of just yet and wants him to join their ranks. 
Though this sounds like a rehash of the secret boarding school for [insert cool profession here] narrative, there are plenty of things about the Syfy series, debuting on Wednesday, that signal a show that can transcend the sales pitch. Here are five:
Lana Condor kicks ass
Allen Fraser/Syfy
Benjamin Wadsworths Marcus Lopez is your typical fish-out-of-water protagonist, the audience proxy in a world of cutthroat assassins and killers. Wadsworth is charming enough and Marcus fills his role of viewer surrogate pretty well, but what makes Deadly Class stand out is the surrounding cast.
Lana Condor, who skyrocketed in fame after last years rom-com To All the Boys I Loved Before, is the top of the class. Her character Saya is no-nonsense, and determined to become valedictorian (were scared to learn what that means, but wish her the best of luck). Particularly compelling is her relationship with María Gabriela de Faría Chacóns Maria, both ruthless in their own ways, best friends instead of rivals. Other sparkling side characters include Willie, a hardened gangster with a secret soft side, eccentric Billy who quickly takes Marcus under his wing, and Goth Girl Petra (my personal favorite for biased reasons). 
The animated flashback sequences 
SyFy/Sony Pictures Television
Occasional flashback sequences punctuate the gritty live-action by lifting imagery straight from the graphic novel. Its aesthetically cool and a little nod to the fact that this is a world thats a bit off-kilter to ours, one where criminals and top CIA agents alike send their kids to an elite school for killers. 
In the pilot episode, Marcus reveals the gruesome fate of his parents and the origins of his personal vendetta against the president (more on that later). It starts off with a pastel green palette, almost childlike in tone as little Marcus follows his parents while carrying a red balloon. But the scene changes sharply. Its intense and unsettling, in an fascinating way. 
These brightly colored snippets also serve as a sharp juxtaposition against the dark live-action material. Thats literal; the live-action footage is dark in a does this version of 1987 San Francisco not have funding for lighting fixtures? way. 
The classes at Kings Dominion 
Allen Fraser/Syfy
A school for aspiring assassins isnt going to follow your typical high school curriculum. Instead of AP Calculus, P.E. and Chemistry, the students at Kings Dominion take courses thatll prepare them for their real world. In AP Black Arts, Master Lin (Benedict Wong) assigning his students to assassinate a worthy target. Hand-to-Hand Combat begins with Miss DeLuca (Erica Cerra) talking about the last stand of the Comanche people against the Republic of Texass declaration of genocide. In Poison Lab, Petra and Billy spike a bullys drink as a prank. 
The social hierarchy of assassin school
The Dixie Mob
Allen Fraser/Syfy
Much like Mean Girls, the assassin school has a brutal and rigid social hierarchy. Marcus is a rat, meaning hes a first-generation student. Fellow rats include the aforementioned Billy and Petra, as well as crass British punk rocker Lex. The rest of Kings Dominion, however, come from existing legacies, and have formed into typical high school cliques, just with more murderous tendencies.
And like Mean Girls, Billy explains the intricacies of the Kings Dominions social hierarchy to Marcus in a cafeteria lunch-hour scene. Some of the cliques Billy points out are the Preps, children of the CIA and FBI; Soto Vatos (cartel...like the star football kids at a normal school); the Dixie Mob; the Hessians (Lower on the totem pole, but [they have] weed); Final World Order; and the Kuroki Syndicate (Yakuza kids). There are a few stragglers with other ties, like brawny Viktor, son of Stalins most infamous assassin, so its possible even more factions exist.
Im going to assassinate Ronald Reagan.
Marcus says this without a hint of irony in the pilot episode. Everyone around him laughs. Its great! Not only does it give Marcus a driving motivation and more character, it also gives us context of the world. Even in this place full of young assassins and gang fights after school, there are still impossible, infeasible crimes, such as killing the president. We dont know if Marcus will succeed over the course of the series hell, its an alternate, assassin-filled world, so anythings possible.

Kris Osborn,"U.S. Navy photo By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kelvin Edwards (Released) A new Navy analysis says producing more Virginia-Class attack submarines on a much faster timetable is necessary to ensure the US' future undersea dominance. The previous status quo was to reduce production of Virginia-Class boats from to two to one in the early 2020s, but the study recommends two per year. If the study's recommendations are adopted, the US would produce two Virginia-Class boats and one Columbia-Class boat per year. A newly completed comprehensive Navy analysis says producing more Virginia-Class attack submarines on a much faster timetable is ""achievable"" and necessary to ensure future undersea dominance for the US - in an increasingly contested strategic global environment. The Navy report, titled The Submarine Industrial Base and the Viability of Producing Additional Attack Submarines Beyond the Fiscal Year 2017 Shipbuilding Plan in the 2017–2030 Timeframe, was delivered to Congress on July 5, 2017, Navy officials told Scout Warrior. The current or previous status quo had been for the Navy to drop from building two Virginia-Class boats per year to one in the early 2020s when construction of the new Columbia-Class nuclear armed submarines begins. The completed study, however, maintains that the Navy and industry can produce two Virginia-Class boats and one Columbia-Class submarine per year, increasing the current plan by one Virginia-Class boat per year. Navy leaders have consistently talked about an expected submarine shortfall in the mid 2020s and that more attack submarines were needed to strengthen the fleet and keep stay in front of near-peer rivals such as Russia and China. The study found that sustainment of the two per year Virginia-Class submarine production rate during the procurement years of the Columbia-Class SSBNs is achievable and that it provides significant benefit to the Navy and the SSN (Attack Submarines) force structure, Navy officials told Scout Warrior. Maintaining a two-per year Virginia Class build-rate will help the Navy reach its goal of 66 SSNs, as identified in the December 2016 Force Structure Assessment, Chatmas added. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Steven Myers Increasing production will, to a large extent, rely upon the submarine-building industry's capacity to move up to three submarines per year. The Virginia-Class Submarines are built by a cooperative arrangement between the Navy and Electric Boat, a subsidiary of General Dynamics and Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries. Each industry partner constructs portions or “modules” of the submarines which are then melded together to make a complete vessel, industry and Navy officials explained. Virginia-Class Attack Submarine Technology Virginia-Class subs are fast-attack submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles, torpedoes and other weapons able to perform a range of missions; these include anti-submarine warfare, strike warfare, covert mine warfare, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), anti-surface/ship warfare and naval special warfare, something described as having the ability to carry and insert Special Operations Forces. Future Virginia-Class submarines (VCS) provide improved littoral (coastal waters) capabilities, sensors, special operations force employment, and strike warfare capabilities, making it an ideal platform for the 21st Century security environment, Navy developers said. Compared to prior Navy attack subs like the Los Angeles-Class, the Virginia-Class submarines are engineered to bring vastly improved littoral warfare, surveillance and open ocean capabilities, service officials said. For instance, the ships can be driven primarily through software code and electronics, thus freeing up time and energy for an operator who does not need to manually control each small maneuver. US Navy The Virginia-Class submarine are engineered with this “Fly-by-Wire” capability which allows the ship to quietly linger in shallow waters without having to surface or have each small move controlled by a human operator. With this technology, a human operator will order depth and speed, allowing software to direct the movement of the planes and rudder to maintain course and depth. Also, unlike their predecessor-subs, Virginia-Class subs are engineered with what’s called a “Lock Out Trunk” – a compartment in the sub which allows special operations forces to submerge beneath the water and deploy without requiring the ship to surface. Unlike their “SSBN” Columbia-Class counterparts to be armed with nuclear weapons, the Virginia-Class “SSN” ships are purely for conventional attack, Navy officials said. Development of Virginia-Class submarines are broken up into procurement “Blocks.” Blocks I and II have already been delivered. The Block III subs, now under construction, are being built with new so-called Virginia Payload Tubes designed to lower costs and increase capability. Instead of building what most existing Virginia-Class submarines have -- 12 individual 21-inch in diameter vertical launch tubes able to fire Tomahawk missiles – the Block III submarines are being built with two larger 87-inch in diameter tubes able to house six Tomahawk missiles each. Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Danna M. Morris Although the new tubes were conceived and designed as part of what the Navy calls its “Design for Affordability” strategy to lower costs, the move also brings strategic advantages to the platform, service officials say. Specifically, this means that the submarines are constructed such that they will be able to accommodate new technologies as they emerge - this could mean engineering in an ability to fire upgraded Tomahawk missiles or other weapons which may emerge in the future. The Block III Virginia-Class submarines also have what’s called a Large Aperture Bow conformal array sonar system – designed to send out an acoustic ping, analyze the return signal, and provide the location and possible contours of enemy ships, submarines and other threats. Virginia-Class Block V - Virginia Payload Modules For Block V construction, the Navy is planning to insert a new 84-foot long section designed to house additional missile capability. “Virginia Payload Modules.” The Virginia Payload Modules, to come in future years, will increase the Tomahawk missile firepower of the submarines from 12 missiles up to 40. The VPM submarines will have an additional (approximately 84 feet) section with four additional Virginia Payload Tubes (VPTs), each capable of carrying seven Tomahawk cruise missiles, for a ship total of 40 Tomahawks. The idea is to have additional Tomahawk or other missile capability increased by 2026, when the “SSGN” Ohio-Class Guided Missile Submarines start retiring in larger numbers. U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jonathan W. Hutto, Sr. Early prototyping work on the Virginia Payload Modules is already underway and several senior Navy leaders, over the years, have indicated a desire to accelerate production and delivery of this technology – which will massively increase fire-power on the submarines. While designed primarily to hold Tomahawks, the VPM missile tubes are engineered such that they could accommodate a new payload, new missile or even a large unmanned underwater vehicle, Navy officials said. The reason for the Virginia Payload Modules is clear; beginning in the 2020s, the Navy will start retiring four large Ohio-class guided-missile submarines able to fire up to 154 Tomahawk missiles each. This will result in the Navy losing a massive amount of undersea fire power capability, Navy officials explained. From 2002 to 2008 the U.S. Navy modified four of its oldest nuclear-armed Ohio-class submarines by turning them into ships armed with only conventional missiles -- the USS Ohio, USS Michigan, USS Florida and USS Georgia. They are called SSGNs, with the “G” designation for “guided missile.”",U.S. Navy photo By Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kelvin Edwards (Released) A new Navy analysis says producing more Virginia-Class attack submarines on a much faster timetable is necessary to ensure the US' future undersea dominance.

Darrell Etherington,"Tesla has unveiled its all-electric semi truck, aptly dubbed the ‘Tesla Semi,’ as promised, and the resulting Class 8 transport vehicle is indeed a sight to behold. It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road. The Tesla Semi will go 0 to 60 mph in just 5 seconds, which is incredibly fast compared to a diesel truck. It can go 0 to 60 mph towing 80,000 lbs, its max tow load, in just 20 seconds. It can go 65 mph up a 5 percent grade, which is way better than the 45 mph max that a diesel competitor can do. And for range, it can go 500 miles at highway speed, and less than 80 percent trips are at 250 miles. It also has a better drag coefficient than a super car thanks to its extremely aerodynamic design. The real secret weapon of the truck, however, isn’t that it can turn into a giant fighting robot (this feature hasn’t been activated yet, if it does exist, and Tesla won’t admit that it does). Instead, it’s that the truck offers a transmission that requires no shifting of gears (as is normal for fully electric vehicles) with regenerative braking that provides “basically infinite” brake life per Tesla. Tesla also says that the Semi outperforms its diesel rivals in terms of responsiveness and handling, and can cover more miles than a diesel semi truck in the same timespan, with safer operation in and around regular traffic. It also uses a number of Model 3 components to maximize production efficiencies, including individual Model 3 motors for each wheel, and even Model 3 inset door handles. Another standout for Tesla’s Semi lies in its design – the company points out that that cabin is tailor-made for drivers, with starts that are designed to make it easier to get in and out, and the ability to stand fully when inside the cab. The driver is also centered in the cab relative to the road, a unique twist on vehicle design in general, but a logical one for a car class that almost never has a passenger. There’s a removable jump seat for a passenger, too, offset and behind the main driver position. Tesla has also added not one, but two of its favorite in-cabin vehicle features to the Semi: Touchscreens. These are positioned on either side of the driver and offer navigation information, blind spot monitoring, and trip data logging applications. There’s also a suite of fleet management and routing tools, which Tesla says would ordinarily require third-party add-on hardware to incorporate into a car. Electric trucks aren’t the exclusive purview of Musk and Tesla, of course. There’s the somewhat trollishly named Nikola, which is working on a hybrid hydrogen powered electric powertrain, which its building with Bosch. Also, Daimler has revealed its own concept for a Mitsubishi E-FUSO fully electric Vision One truck with 220 miles of range, but with no specified release window. What’s the big deal about an electric semi truck? It’s a fair question, especially given the range of traditional Diesel engine heavy duty trucks. These can have ranges of up to nearly 900 miles on a single tank. But the long-term advantages of electric trucks could make a lot of sense, both from a relatively obvious ecological perspective, which is obvious, and from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. Electric trucks could be longer-lived and less expensive to maintain over the long term, and the cost to refuel them over their lifetimes should be far less than the cost to operate a truck that uses an internal combustion engine. Tesla says the Semi requires “significantly less maintenance” than a diesel truck, in particular because it lacks the high-strain moving parts of internal combustion engine vehicles, including the engine, transmission, after-treatment system and differentials. The Tesla Semi also offers advanced safety features, with a special battery design that reinforces the battery units themselves and also helps lower the center of gravity of the truck overall thanks to their positioning in the chassis. The windshield is also built of glass designed to resist impacts, and the truck is made to avoid jackknifing, a common problem for this class of truck, by automatically detecting any stability that could lead to this issue and torquing each wheel accordingly, whose also activating the brakes as needed. Surround view cameras try to eliminate blind sots, and also help to support object detection, providing alerts to the driver automatically when they identify potential hazards. Tesla has also built Enhanced Autopilot features into its Semi, which is not surprising given the work it’s done pioneering and refining these drier assistance features on its lineup of consumer cars. On the Semi, Tesla’s Autopilot offers automated emergency braking, lane keeping and lane departure warnings to help encourage safe highway driving. This is definitely a futuristic version of the modern transport truck, with a lot of bells and whistles that indeed look like they could make the lives of both freight shipping companies and drivers much more comfortable and convenient overall. The focus on drivers, in particular, is interesting as it appears as though Tesla is hoping to gain support for its trucking from ground-up endorsement, as well as by appealing to the long-term financial reasoning of the shipping companies themselves. OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA This version of the truck is a day truck, without a sleeper and designed for short hauls accordingly. But Tesla said it could easily extend the cab to accommodate a sleeper cabin, and then extend the underlying battery pack to support that, too. It can also be used with or without the aerodynamic cowling above the hood, depending on the height of the trailer it’s pulling. Tesla will probably still face a lot of challenges in terms of both getting this truck built at scale, and encouraging broad adoption. But it’s sticking to its playbook of looking at an industry where the legacy players have done something one way for a long time with relatively little in the way of innovation, and changing things drastically. The question is whether applying this model will continue to work in its favor.","It boasts a considerable charge capacity, and has a very aesthetically distinct look, as you can see, which will obviously help it stand out from other commercial freight vehicles on the road.

Ahiza Garcia,"""We were harassed, we were bullied and we were body-shamed for $7.25 an hour,"" said former cheerleader Ainsley Parish, who is among the five who are suing. ""The Houston Texans should not have given us a uniform if they did not want us to become an army."" The lawsuit, which was announced in a press conference on Friday, is being brought by prominent attorney Gloria Allred. ""These women all had the same dream: They all aspired to be an integral part of the Houston Texans. And they looked forward to promoting the team,"" Allred said during a press conference. ""But their dreams were shattered by the reality of their lives as Houston Texans cheerleaders."" Allred said the women were harassed, intimidated and forced to live in fear."" She said they were threatened with being fired if they spoke out. The cheerleaders were also instructed not to speak with players and weren't paid for making public appearances. One of the cheerleaders, Hannah Turnbow, was allegedly assaulted by a fan and was told to ""suck it up and act like nothing had happened,"" according to Allred. She said there are photos of the injury the cheerleader sustained. Turnbow said she and her teammates were expected to attend events where no transportation or security was provided. The five former cheerleaders, who were part of the squad as recently as the 2017 season, are filing individual lawsuits versus pursuing a class action. Last week, three different former cheerleaders filed a lawsuit against the Texans over pay and treatment. Those women are seeking class action status. The Houston Texans responded to both lawsuits with the following statement: ""We are proud of the cheerleader program and have had hundreds of women participate and enjoy their experience while making a positive impact in the local community. We are constantly evaluating our procedures and will continue to make adjustments as needed to make the program enjoyable for everyone."" Related: NFL cheerleader files complaint over 'discriminatory' measures governing conduct The former cheerleaders are the latest to allege that they were unfairly treated and paid while representing NFL teams. In March, a former New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging gender discrimination by the NFL team. In her complaint, Jacalyn Bailey Davis said female cheerleaders and male players were held to different standards of personal conduct. She also said cheerleaders were told not to interact with players, to block them on social media and to leave a restaurant or party if an NFL player was there or showed up after them. An attorney for the Saints said in a statement that the team ""denies that Ms. Davis was discriminated against because she is female."" The statement said the team's ""policies and workplace rules will withstand legal scrutiny."" Cheerleaders for the New York Jets, Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills have also sued their respective NFL teams demanding fair pay. Cheerleaders for the Buccaneers, Raiders, Bengals and Jets reached settlements with the teams. The cheerleaders for the Bills filed a class action suit against the team, the NFL and several intermediary companies. The case, which was initially brought in 2014, currently isn't moving forward because one of the companies being sued went bankrupt. The Bills were not immediately available for comment on Friday about the case.

Bryan Menegus,"Uber is a company that dictates how a large number of car owners pick up passengers, where they take them, how they take them there, the condition of the vehicle those people get put in, and the pay they earn, but it does not consider those drivers to be its employees.
As you can imagine, this has led to quite a few lawsuits.
A class-action lawsuit, which began as a challenge to how it classifies drivers but ultimately centered on Ubers attempts to resolve conflicts with drivers outside of a courtroom, was one such suit. Settled today in Californias Northern District Court, it will cost the ridesharing company at least $20 million, pending a judges sign-off. ($5 million in legal fees are reportedly also being sought from Uber.)
Payouts after more than five years of litigation, including the decertification of the original class which included 385,000 drivers, will likely be minimal for the approximately 13,000 remaining plaintiffs. The decision to settle the suit, OConner v Uber, will set no precedent for similar cases about drivers statuses as full employees vs contractors nor change the companys policy of burying arbitration agreements deep in the terms of service agreements that few of its drivers likely actually read.
For context, drivers, customers, and the government tangle with Uber with a regularity that could only be startling if youve totally avoided any story about the company in the past six years. It paid out $84 million to drivers in Massachusetts, $10 million over driver background checks, another $10 million to female software engineers in its ranks for allegedly discriminatory practices, $20 million to setting an FTC complaint that it over-hyped potential earnings to drivers, a handful in the hundreds-of-thousands of dollars for allegedly underpaying drivers and discriminating against people with vision loss, $20 million for sending text message spam no one asked for, and $148 million in a data breach settlement.
Ultimately, another $20 millionnot even $1,500 per driver before legal fees, after half a decade in courtis just another slap on the wrist for a company with a track record of allegedly skirting labor laws and generally doing whatever the hell they feel like, to the detriment of its workers and the places it operates.","Uber is a company that dictates how a large number of car owners pick up passengers, where they take them, how they take them there, the condition of the vehicle those people get put in, and the pay they earn, but it does not consider those drivers to be its …",2019-03-12T21:26:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Uber Is Another $20 Million Poorer After Settling Driver Lawsuit,https://gizmodo.com/uber-is-another-20-million-poorer-after-settling-drive-1833242461,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ODzBLmAa--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/hicwvpty6trhu2qcrwo1.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,class-5,1

Aimée Lutkin,"If you’re facing the prospect of 10+ hour flight in crowded, cramped economy class, remember that there are still some in-flight luxuries they can’t take from you at the security gate. We can make the worst section of the plane feel slightly less terrible with a little planning and packing. You may not think it’s worth it now, but at about hour six of being suspended in mid-air in a sardine can, you’ll wish you’d prepped more. Here are some ways to make economy far more comfortable. Dress for the weather Some flights will provide a blanket—though usually not in Economy. The air is usually pretty frigid, so writer Ariana Arghandewal recommended in Flyertalk that you dress in a winter jacket for the ride, even if you’re heading some where sunny. In general, comfortable layers are a good choice for a long flight, because you’ll cycle through many temperatures. A jacket is also wise if you don’t want to pack your own blanket in precious carry-on space, but a blanket might still be easier to store when you deboard. And a blanket you choose at the department store will probably be warmer (and cleaner) than the thin ones they sell when you’re already thousands of miles up in the air. Nicole Byer, storyteller extraordinaire and star of Loosely Exactly Nicole, appeared on Conan… Read more Read Accessorize with a pillow What goes better with a blanket than a pillow? There a few options, and Skyscanner recommends the inflatable options for the sake of carry-on space, again. There are pillows that provide support for your neck and also ones that work more for lumbar support if you have lower back problems. If you don’t now, you might after a 14-hour flight. Arghandewal also shared this sleeping position that I cannot quite picture, but maybe you can: Stick something with a hard surface under the seat in front of you, place a pillow behind your lower back, then slide down at an angle. You’ll be able to stretch your legs and not deal with having to sleep in an upright position. It does require at least one pillow. Consider your hygiene At some point, you will want to brush your teeth, I promise you. Pack yourself a little kit, per Arghandewal’s suggestion—she says her six items are a “toothbrush, paste, floss, deodorant, moisturizer, and socks,” but Skyscanner also recommends “face spritz, under eye gel, tired eye drops, moisturizer, lip-balm, face wipes.” This kit is starting to look like a full bathroom cabinet! One thing that’s pretty slim to pack and will take the place of a number of those items is a disposable sheet face mask, as long as you’re not embarrassed to wear one in front of your seat mates. But it will leave you all dewey and moisturized at landing and kill about 5-10 minutes of the flight. Maybe it’ll even be a conversation starter, if you feel like chatting. Planning for sleep Don’t try to exhaust yourself so you’ll sleep on the flight, because you’ll just get cranky if you don’t succeed. Let it happen if it’s gonna happen and try to make conditions as good as possible: in addition to your pillows and blankets, pack earplugs or headphones and an eye mask to block out the light. If nothing else, bundling up in sleepwear will discourage that weird person wearing a green tea face mask from talking to you. Get that upgrade Funnily enough, both Arghandewal and Skyscanner recommend trying to score an upgrade, and get the heck out of Economy. Arghandewal swears that the fee can be less when you try to make that upgrade at the airport, as low as $300. That sounds high to me, but it may be worth it, especially if you didn’t pack your emergency hygiene kit.","If you’re facing the prospect of 10+ hour flight in crowded, cramped economy class, remember that there are still some in-flight luxuries they can’t take from you at the security gate.

Little things that would never make it as a back-of-the-box bullet point, but which still communicate so much about how this new Battlefield is different from all the past Battlefields. So here you go: 7 things you can do in Battlefield V that you couldn't before. 1. Build up your base Fortifications are a thing now! Every soldier hits the battlefield with a tool kit in hand. You can use that tool kit in set locations — especially around capture points — to build resupply stations, sandbag walls, barbed wire fences, tank deterrents, foxholes... you name it. 2. Stick with your squad Squads are elevated to a whole new level of importance in Battlefield V. You've always had the ability to respawn on squadmates, but now you can go a step further and actually see where they are and what they're doing from an over-the-shoulder perspective before you spawn back in. You know how you used to spawn in on a squadmate only to be gunned down seconds later? That should happen a whole lot less in Battlefield V. 3. Anyone can revive now, sort of Medics are still very much the go-to soldier class for players that like to heal. They can revive any downed soldier quickly, bringing them back to full health and ready to fight in no time. But medics aren't the only way to escape death. Squadmates also have the ability to revive one another, regardless of class. It'll take longer to do the revive than a proper medic, and your buddy won't come back with all their health. But it's something. Especially since.... 4. You can drag downed teammates to safety Great news for medics and helpful squadmates alike: When you see a teammate bleeding out on the ground, you can lend a hand and drag them off to a safe location before you get to work on reviving them. It's especially helpful for squadmate revives, since those take longer (unless you're a medic). But everyone should benefit from not being caught in a situation where you're gunned down immediately after being revived. 5. Squad leaders can do cool stuff if they lead well It's not new that Battlefield's squad leaders get some measure of control over their squaddies: When you're the leader, you can issue non-verbal orders that highlight a particular capture/defend point or some other objective. Battlefield V takes that leadership a step further by giving every squad leader a radio. As your squaddies follow orders and complete objectives, you earn points. Earn enough points and you can spend them, via the radio, on all sorts of bonuses: Supply drops, smoke screen barrages, heavy weapons and tanks, and even rocket strikes. 6. Stationary weapons are stationary no more Fixed weapon emplacements like anti-air or anti-tank turrets are no longer locked in one location. In Battlefield V you're able to connect them to an assortment of vehicles and drag them around, trailer-style. 7. Soldier classes can be further specialized Battlefield's four core classes — Assault, Support, Medic, and Recon — are all back in Battlefield V, but that's only where your customization begins. New archetypes allow you to tailor your preferred class for different types of battle conditions. DICE didn't go too heavily into the specifics here, but these archetypes come with skill trees that look like they offer a significant amount of control over how you progress.","We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V.

At 32, he is at the peak of a career that has taken him to stardom at Spurs and Real Madrid. He is also Croatia’s top passer, and the team rises and falls on his performance. Denmark vs. Croatia Top Story Lines • Croatia has advanced to the knockout stage of the World Cup for the second time in its history. The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark’s first visit to the last 16 since 2002. • Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland. • With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game. • One of Denmark’s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, “What I can say about Eriksen is, he’s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He’s the most important player for Denmark.” The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension. • These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Denmark won theat game, with Peter Schemichel, father of current keeper Kasper Schmeichel, in goal. • Croatia is a comfortable favorite to win, with Denmark 4-1 or so.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hundreds of packets of drugs were found stashed underneath the floor of the bus Police in Colombia have arrested six men in connection with a scheme to smuggle large quantities of marijuana and cocaine in passenger buses. The arrests come days after police searching a bus which crashed in neighbouring Ecuador found it to be packed with hundreds of kilos of dugs. Twenty-three people died and 22 were injured when the bus collided with an SUV on 14 August. The driver of the bus is being questioned by police. Originally the number of people who died in the crash had been put at 24 but later reports said 23. Officers searching the wreck of the bus for clues as to why it crashed did not at first find the stash of marijuana and cocaine. It was only after sniffer dogs alerted their handlers to the presence of drugs on the vehicle that officers found 80kg (175lb) of cocaine and more than 600kg of marijuana stashed in hidden compartments below the floor, in the seat cushions and in other parts of the vehicle's metal frame. Image copyright EPA Image caption Most of the parcels contained marijuana, others were full of cocaine The bus crashed in the early hours of the morning in Pichincha province. It had left the south-western Colombian city of Cali on 5 August carrying, among others, a group of 40 Colombian holidaymakers from a working-class neighbourhood in Cali. The passengers from Cali said they had been offered a free excursion to Peru via Ecuador. Some said they had been approached by a woman who accompanied them on the trip while others said they had been told the ""freebie"" was courtesy of a local politician. Image copyright AFP Image caption Many of those who were killed were from a working-class neighbourhood in Cali Investigators suspect they were offered the trip free of cost to fill the bus with ""tourists"" to make it appear less conspicuous. Ecuador's chief counter-narcotics officer, Gen Carlos Alulema, said that the use of tour buses was ""a new modus operandi used to smuggle drugs"". Gen Alulema said the crashed bus was the fourth in which drugs had been found in recent months. The prosecutor-general's office in Colombia said that those arrested were part of a gang which had specialised in sending ""narco-buses"" from Colombia via Ecuador and Peru all the way to Chile.","When police searched the bus, which crashed killing 23 people, they found it full of drugs.",2018-08-20T14:55:10Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Six held over 'drugs bus' which crashed in Ecuador,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45245484,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CF4D/production/_103096035_3ac1551c-b825-45e8-b11e-1ad8bfc4ed5c.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,class-5,1
Aarian Marshall,"The Bay Area is blessed; the Bay Area is cursed. This is how Gabriel Metcalf, the director of the urban policy think tank San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association—aka SPUR—puts it, more or less. “We really have everything we need to successfully solve our problems,” he says. “What we’re missing is a kind of civic will to act at the necessary scale.” This month, SPUR embarks on a three-year project to create a regional strategy for the country’s richest area—and its most unequal. The strategy goes far beyond the standard 5, 10, or 20 years for such plans. SPUR is projecting all the way to 2070. And this month, the group released a report on “future scenarios”. They’re an attempt to answer: What happens if nothing in the Bay Area changes over the next half century? What happens if everything does? “It’s too easy to create a massive dystopian document, that the future is all going to be terrible,” says Allison Arieff, SPUR’s editorial director. “This is an effort, in earnest, to look for the positive.” It’s also an interesting way to get at the area’s main gifts and problems, most of which can be summed up in a few statistics. The region, which stretches from Sonoma County in the north, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties in the east, San Francisco in the west, and San Mateo County in the south, put out $748 billion in gross domestic product last year. Its economy is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the US. More than half of Bay Area residents have a bachelor’s degree or more. The median home resold for $712,000 at the beginning of this year, up 11 percent from the year previous. Just 4 percent of the region’s housing is subsidized. High fees and a tortuous permitting progress make it hard to build more. Thanks to increasing traffic congestion, commute times are now at record levels, while residents are taking far fewer public transit trips than they did 25 years ago. Projections show middle-wage jobs in the Bay Area will account for just 22 percent of the job growth in the area between 2010 and 2020—meaning the share of middle-wage jobs has declined compared to low- and high-wage ones. So you don’t need a stack of paper to know that fixing the place by 2070 comes down to the economy. That, plus housing, transportation, and land use. Oh, and the variables that local policy alone cannot control: climate change, natural disasters, whatever the heck is going on in Washington. It’s all very complicated, which is why SPUR’s scenarios make for a useful rubric. Of course, it’s pitched toward the organization’s own policy views: that increased economic prosperity can be created hand-in-hand with the tech community, and that building market-rate housing is one path out of the affordability crunch. Let’s start with what happens if nothing changes. SPUR calls this scenario “Gated Utopia”. Service jobs are automated, and the people who used to do this work have moved away. Schools are good because there’s only rich people here now. Public transit is OK, but only in the urban core, and most of the area’s wealthy residents rely on private transportation, like personal autonomous vehicles. The area is packed with random millionaires—former middle class folk who happened to buy homes when prices were low. Safe, but homogenous; successful, but only for some. “If the current trends continue, that’s where we end up,” says Metcalf. Scenario two: “Bunker Bay Area”, a place marked by economic decline and social exclusion, meaning people are bereft of opportunities because of their income or education level, or because of the color of their skin. The gradual concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is masked, for a time, by the area’s booming economy. But as homelessness becomes more and more common, money leaks out of the public safety net and away from job training programs. The gated community is the architectural signature, as the wealthy use their own resources to protect themselves. Low-income people rely on an informal economy to survive. Three: “Rust Belt West”, a place dominated by anti-business sentiment, economic decline, and social inclusion, meaning politicians and institutions work hard to support workers, the middle class, and the poor. Informal co-ops have taken over for municipal garbage collection and public transit, while hospitals and pharmacies lay mostly fallow. “As companies left, there were no business leaders to contest the policy choices, which over time became more and more extreme,” SPUR explains in its report. Finally, the best of all possible worlds: “A New Social Compact”, a place where the economy booms and social inclusion thrives. A single regional transportation agency—right now, there are eight in the Bay Area—has extended service into lower-density areas, while reconfiguring roads for walking and scooters. Immigration continues unabated. Smaller, infill homes bloom. The terms are meant to be a starting point for a longer process, one that won’t just be guided by SPUR’s own staff. “Planners are in the middle of this shift in how decisions are made. It’s less top-down, though not fully bottom-up,” says Arieff, referencing Robert Moses ’ highway building by near fiat as the “old model” of city decision making. “Organizations such as ours have to be wide open and receptive and inclusive of as many voices as possible.” She notes SPUR will hold three public listening sessions in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, to get a sense for where many groups’ priorities lie. 2070 feels far away, but knowing what residents really want it to look like is the first step in getting there.

JAMES BARRON,"Mr. Elegudin said the agency was reviewing its maintenance practices. “The truth is, some of the elevators that were installed early on aren’t as reliable and don’t provide the diagnostics we need,” Mr. Elegudin said. “There is nothing worse than getting to a station and finding the elevator is not working.” He said it had happened to him. “You’re literally stuck in our system,” he said. The transit agency is facing three lawsuits about accessibility (the center that Ms. Amari works for is a plaintiff in one, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan; the others were filed in federal court). A spokesman for the agency said it did not comment on litigation. Separately, he noted that transit facilities built before the federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the 1990s “are generally not required to be made accessible.” Joe Rappaport, the executive director of the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, an organization bringing one of the suits, said the transit agency needed to be required to live up to Mr. Byford’s promises. “Andy Byford’s successor or the successor after that may not have the same commitment,” he said. For now, the challenges persist. April Coughlin, a transit advocate and college professor who uses a wheelchair, anticipated problems on a recent afternoon when she took the R train to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. Since early morning, the app on her cellphone had said the elevator at DeKalb Avenue was not working.

Taylor Hatmaker,"Concerns around Facebook’s recently revealed data sharing relationship with some device makers just took a turn for the worse. The practice, first revealed over the weekend, is now confirmed to have included relationships with Chinese companies Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL, according to The New York Times. Given that the U.S. government has longstanding national security concerns over Huawei, Facebook’s newly revealed data deal with the Chinese company has raised some eyebrows in Congress. “Concerns about Huawei aren’t new – they were widely publicized beginning in 2012, when the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a well-read report on the close relationships between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei,” U.S. Senator Mark Warner said of the revelation. Warner serves as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The news that Facebook provided privileged access to Facebook’s API to Chinese device makers like Huawei and TCL raises legitimate concerns, and I look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that information about their users was not sent to Chinese servers.” In that report, the House Intelligence Committee wrote that “Huawei did not fully cooperate with the investigation and was unwilling to explain its relationship with the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party, while credible evidence exists that it fails to comply with U.S. laws” and that Huawei’s history indicated that it likely had ties to the Chinese military. Earlier in the day, the Senate Commerce Committee addressed a letter to Facebook over the broader issue of these manufacturer relationships and questioning Facebook’s assertion that the shared data was not abused. As the New York Times reports, these relationships date back “at least 2010” — the relative dark ages of Facebook’s mobile strategy. It does not appear that ZTE had a similar agreement with Facebook. Facebook has disputed the characterization of these relationships as a privacy scandal, emphasizing that it imposed tight restrictions on this class of device integration. These integrations are very different from our public APIs — the goal was to recreate Facebook-like experiences on these devices, and they were tightly controlled. — Facebook (@facebook) June 5, 2018 Facebook told the New York Times that while the partnerships have been ongoing for years, the company would end its relationship with Huawei by the week’s end.","Concerns around Facebook’s recently revealed data sharing relationship with some device makers just took a turn for the worse.

"Catherine E. Shoichet and Priscilla Alvarez, CNN","(CNN)It could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border, officials said in a court filing.
The government's proposed plan, detailed for the first time in documents filed late Friday night, outlines a strategy for piecing together exactly who might have been separated by combing through thousands of records using a mix of data analysis and manual review.
The court filing comes a year after a memo from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially created the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy, which eventually led to the separation of thousands of immigrant families. While a federal court order forced the reunification of many of those families, an explosive government watchdog report in January revealed there could be thousands more who hadn't previously been acknowledged by officials.
And a federal judge last month ruled that this group should be included in the class-action lawsuit over family separations. 
The judge's order was a major blow for the Trump administration, which had argued finding these families would be too burdensome a task. And it now presents a major logistical challenge for the government.
Several factors complicate the process, officials said in Friday's court filing:
 All the children from this group of separated families have already been released from government custody
 US Customs and Border Protection didn't start tracking separated families as a searchable data set in its records before April 19, 2018
 A manual review alone would ""overwhelm ORR's existing resources"" because teams would have to comb through nearly 50,000 case files
Instead of taking that approach, officials propose using data analysis to hone in on which records are likely to be separated children, and then to embark on more painstaking manual reviews. The process, officials said, would take ""at least 12 months, and possibly up to 24 months.""
A team of officials representing the Department of Health and Human Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection would lead the effort, the filing said. They would then convene a data analysis team led by a senior biostatistician. 
Last month, US District Judge Dana Sabraw issued a 14-page ruling modifying the class definition, following revelations that the government had been separating families as far back as July 1, 2017, months before the controversial ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy was announced. Officials estimated that the children were separated, received by HHS for care and released prior to Sabraw's June 26, 2018, court order ordering a halt to most family separations at the US border.
Plaintiffs ""request that the government identify the families whom it separated on or after July 1, 2017 whose children were released from ORR before June 26, 2018,"" according to a court document late last month. They note that the government should ""start the process immediately."" The government had proposed submitting a proposal on next steps ""on or before April 5, 2019.""
The Ms. L, et al. vs. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, et al., case was initially prompted by the separation of a Congolese woman and her 7-year-old daughter. The American Civil Liberties Union originally filed the case last year and it was later expanded to become a class action lawsuit.
Last June, Sabraw issued a preliminary injunction blocking most family separations at the US-Mexico border and ordered the government to reunite the families it had divided.
Since then, the administration has provided regular reports to the court on the reunification status of children and parents whom the government separated, including some parents who were deported but ultimately elected not to be reunified with their children.
As of March 25, 2019, the government has discharged 2,749 of 2,814 possible children of potential class members, up eight since the last status report on March 6.","It could take up to two years for the government to identify potentially thousands of additional immigrant families US authorities separated at the southern border, officials said in a court filing.",2019-04-06T13:36:45Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","It may take 2 years to identify thousands of separated families, government says",https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/06/politics/family-separations-plan/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190404095946-01-zero-tolerance-tl-june-2018-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-5,1
Ingrid Lunden,"In 2012, Cisco made one of its biggest-ever acquisitions — and a major step into the Israeli tech world — when it acquired video and security specialist NDS for $5 billion. Now, the company is selling part of that business to one of its previous owners, the private equity firm Permira, as it looks to refocus itself and boost growth in networking, multi-cloud, security, data, and collaboration services. Permira says it is acquiring selected video technology assets, along with other cloud technology services, which it plans to launch as a new, standalone business. The new, rebranded company will be “focused on developing and delivering video solutions for the Pay-TV industry,” and it will unveil its new name and more details after the transaction is closed. The board of Cisco has already approved the deal, and it is expected to close in Q1 of the 2019 fiscal year. Abe Peled, the former chairman and CEO of NDS and a Permira advisor, will be leading the new company (the CEO as yet is unnamed). He said in a statement that the business had been profitable under Cisco. “We are proud of our innovation in video and the customer momentum that the Service Provider Video group has built,” said Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO, Cisco, in a statement. “With the leadership team and Abe as Chairman, the new company is well-positioned to drive this work forward and continue to deliver the solutions that meet the current and future needs of service provider video customers. Service providers remain a key customer segment for Cisco, and we look forward to continuing to partner with them to deliver new revenue-generating services and experiences.” More from Cisco on the divestment here, and there may be yet more detail when the company reports its quarterly earnings in two weeks. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. There are reports in the Israeli press of a $1 billion price tag, but I’ve been told by a source that this is “way off.” I’ll add more detail as and when I get it. There have been reports swirling since November 2017 that Cisco was looking to divest its Videoscape business and that Permira would be the buyer. From what we understand, the assets represent a significant chunk of Cisco’s service provider video business. The include the following: Among the assets that were part of the original NDS business, Permira is buying Cisco’s video security services, including smartcards and software solutions associated with conditional access security; video middleware, or software solutions that provide advanced user experiences on any underlying set-top box hardware; and software for video services. Among the assets that were a part of Cisco’s Infinite Video Platform (IVP), Permira is acquiring Cisco’s cloud video recording solutions for managing, storing, and playing recordings; cloud platform solutions for video consumption on any device on any network; and video processing solutions covering encryption, management and distribution of live and on-demand content. Permira is not acquiring video and media technology that Cisco is using related to its existing networking, multi-cloud, security, data and collaboration services. In other words, WebEx and things like that are not a part of this deal. The divestment is key development for Cisco. Across much of 2017, the company reported little growth in its major segments and has more generally been facing a lot of pricing pressure around its hardware and networking businesses. “Other products”, meanwhile, have seen their revenues shrinking (see here and here ). In that context, the NDS business and related solutions may have been seen by some as legacy assets that needed to be cut away so that Cisco could focus more on trying to grow other parts of its business. Those that were called out in a blog post by Yvette Kanouff, SVP of Cisco’s service provider business, include mass-scale networking, automation, optical, optics, cable access, and mobility, security, collaboration, IoT, and professional services. Created to serve Pay-TV companies as they existed in the late 80s-2000s — it was originally founded in 1988 — NDS at one point was even co-owned by one of them, News Corp, which had a 49 percent stake in NDS, with Permira holding 51 percent, when it was sold to Cisco for $5 billion in 2012. (For some extra context, News Corp and Permira originally paid $3.7 billion for NDS when they took it private in 2009.) Times have moved on, though. The development of cloud-based video and streaming have led to a different class of set-top boxes. And more importantly, a growing number of consumers now choose to bypass traditional PayTV providers altogether, either opting for something like an Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV solution, or going the direct to Internet route and using YouTube and other services. That also means a lot of pricing pressure for those who are still working with these providers. The theory behind divesting the Cisco assets and rebuilding them is that many of these Pay-TV providers are still very much in business and want to stay that way, so there is an opportunity to both service them as is, but also come up with new products and services to help bring them into the 21st century. “This is a unique opportunity to lead and shape the video industry during its transition with the flexibility as a private company,” said Dr. Peled in a statement. “The new company will have the scale, technology innovation, and world-class team to deliver outstanding go-to-market execution, customer engagement, and new end-user experiences. Cisco has built a profitable business in the video space with innovations to capitalize on IP distribution and cloud-based services. These combined assets provide a significant new opportunity for the new company. I am thrilled to be working again in this area with Permira who is committed to innovation and support for our Pay-TV customers, and look forward to the ongoing working relationship with Cisco in support of our mutual customers.”","In 2012, Cisco made one of its biggest-ever acquisitions — and a major step into the Israeli tech world — when it acquired video and security specialist NDS for $5 billion.

In 1983, she followed RuPaul to New York City, where for a time they shared an apartment in the still ungentrified meatpacking district. The epicenter of East Village drag was the Pyramid Club on Avenue A, and RuPaul and Lady Bunny (as she now called herself) became in-house queens, go-go dancing for $40 a night. Her first time performing, she said, I did a rousing lip-sync of I Will Survive and fell halfway through it, lost my wig, and lost a shoe. But theres that little lull in the music right before the end, and somehow I got up, got my wig back on and finished the number with one shoe. One night after the club closed, Bunny and some fellow revelers sauntered into nearby Tompkins Square Park. We started clowning on the stage in front of a few homeless people who were sick of our yelling and trying to sleep at 5 a.m., she said. And we just came up with the idea to parody Woodstock and do it as Wigstock. Im sure the idea would have died with the next days hangover, but I actually said, Im going to apply for a permit.","Three decades after landing in New York with RuPaul, Lady Bunny rules as New York’s reigning drag queen, even as a younger generation nips at her heels.",2018-09-29T10:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Lady Bunny Is Still the Shadiest Queen Around,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/style/lady-bunny-drag-queen.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/30/autossell/30LADYBUNNY-promo/30LADYBUNNY-3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1

REBECCA COLLARD,"The rash eases up in the winter, Ms. Suleiman said, but even on a bitter cold December day, Sariya’s face was bright red and dry. Sariya, now 5, sat on his mother’s lap in their apartment. He smiled and made eye contact with visitors, but became shy when a stranger asked him a direct question. Sariya said the rash did not hurt or itch, but his mother said that sometimes he scratched his face and it bled. The family was living in Bowayda, outside Damascus, in 2012. There was almost no food left as Syria’s civil war raged, and what was at the markets was too expensive. Rice, Ms. Suleiman said, cost up to $15 for about a pound. Sometimes the family would secure small portions of grains, sugar or lentils, and ration that among the seven of them for weeks. By 2013, she said, there was nothing left at the markets. Photo Sariya during a school exercise. The other children are kind to him for the most part, said Lozan Kurdi, a teacher, but some have stopped going to class because they are scared of his skin condition. Credit Diego Ibarra Sanchez for The New York Times “There was no food, no milk and no medicine,” Ms. Suleiman said. “We ate grass and herbs from the ground. This is food you usually give to cows.” Everyone in the family lost weight. “We were just bones,” Ms. Suleiman said. She would breast-feed Sariya, but she was not sure if she was producing enough milk. “I tried,” she said. “If not, he would have died.” After the rocket hit the house, the family went to stay with Ms. Suleiman’s parents in the same village.

A.A. Newton,"Earlier this week, Epicurious site director David Tamarkin excitedly tweeted that they were in need of a sharp, cooking-obsessed editorial assistant. Within 48 hours, the posting had been mercilessly roasted by Media Twitter, and the New York State Department of Labor was even forced to intervene. What happened?
First, lets take another look at the posting itself: 
To anyone whos read more than a few entry-level job descriptions, this is depressing but familiar stuff: a major corporation wants to hire one person (at the start of his/her career, naturally) to do the work of roughly three full time, experienced employees, for an undisclosed hourly wage and no benefits. From a work-life balance perspective, there are a lot of red flags here, but there are also some very real legal problems with the original posting. Theres a fine line between this job would probably suck and this is actually illegal, and all job seekersespecially young people, or anyone starting out in a new industryneed to know the difference.
When it comes to job postings, the most common violations have to do with worker classification and/or discrimination against members of a protected class. Knowing your rightsand how to report illegal activityis the first line of defense against exploitative labor practices. Heres what to look out for. 
Worker classifications, tax laws, and labor standards
To understand why this job posting blew up the way it did, you should know the difference between an independent contractor and an employee. The main difference between the two is who is responsible for withholding taxes on earned income: independent contractors and freelancers withhold and pay their own taxes, while employees have their taxes automatically withheld by their employer.
Are you a full time employee of the company you work for, or are you an independent contractor?
Read more Read
Taxes arent the only thing at play here, though; the independent part of independent contractor is just as important. If youre doing freelance work for a company, they have absolutely no say in how or where you get your work done, so long as you complete it in a timely manner. Per the New York State Department of Labor, Independent contractors are free from supervision, direction, and control in their activities. This means that employers cannot require freelancers to come into an office, attend meetings, or otherwise tell them how to spend their time: 
Legally, theres no such thing as a full-time freelancer. Even if a job posting advertises a freelance position that requires 40 hours of work each week, they cant force an independent contractor to adhere to a usual Monday-Friday 9-5 schedule. The Epicurious job posting made the mistake of advertising a freelance position with not only a full-time employees workload, but strict requirements for where the work is done: in their office, presumably during the standard work week. The bottom line: if a job posting specifies when, where, and how youll work for them, they had better be withholding taxes from your paycheckand ideally providing you with a benefits package.
Since worker classifications dictate who pays employment taxes and when, both state and federal labor departments take mis-classification complaints pretty seriously. Condé Nast learned this the hard way:
It has since been clarified that this job will be full-time after all, and with benefits: health insurance, a 401(k), and sick leave.
Protected classes
Employment discrimination based on protected classes is illegal in the United States, and The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) is the main body responsible for enforcing the federal laws that deal with it. Heres what they have to say about job advertisements specifically: 
It is illegal for an employer to publish a job advertisement that shows a preference for or discourages someone from applying for a job because of his or her race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.
In other words, its illegal to specify a preference for certain members of a protected class in a job posting: entry-level is fine, but were looking for a recent college graduate is not, because it could discourage people over 40 from applying. Wording isnt the only form of job posting discrimination: a 2018 EEOC complaint argues that targeting Facebook job ads to certain audiences discourages and even prevents others from applying, which could be a violation of federal law. 
EEOC standards also apply to job referrals, recruitment strategies, and application and hiring practices, including interview questions, background checks, and application tests. The latter can only be used to obtain information essential for determining if a person is qualified for the jobso no questions about race, age, religion, disability, gender, or the like.
Interviewing for a job doesnt mean you have to give up all of your personal information and
Read more Read
Most employers with an HR department know what they can and cannot say in a job posting, so flagrant EEOC violations are rare; the original Epicurious posting didnt contain any at all. Still, every now and then something slips through. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the EEOCs Prohibited Practices so you know what to look out for in your job search. 
How to report violations
Generally speaking, if theres an issue with employee classification or other labor standards, contacting your states department of labor is a good first step. If you see a posting that discriminates based on protected class, however, you may want to lodge a complaint with the EEOC.
In the deluge of sexual-harassment allegations over the last few months, one question keeps coming
Read more Read
That said, labor departments and the EEOC arent the only regulatory bodies involved in employment discrimination; the formal complaint process is complex and often moves very slowly. This is where visibility can be helpful: when the Condé Nast job went viral, people started tweeting at the NYS Department of Labor to get them involved, and it worked. If and when you run across exploitative or illegal job postings in the wild, dont be afraid to make a little noise. Share them with your friends, post them on social media, do whatever you have to do to get it noticed. More than ever, workers need to speak up for our rightssilence only enables further exploitation.","Earlier this week, Epicurious site director David Tamarkin excitedly tweeted that they were in need of a “sharp, cooking-obsessed editorial assistant.” Within 48 hours, the posting had been mercilessly roasted by Media Twitter, and the New York State Departme…",2019-03-14T17:51:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How to Identify and Report an Illegal Job Posting,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-identify-and-report-an-illegal-job-posting-1833295818,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--rJg9XQwE--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/wsyqkhzgzr0nhrlxrbaa.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,class-5,1
Jamie Rigg,"Sony is currently able to claim bragging rights on a few shooting modes you don't get elsewhere. They might be special from a technical perspective, but they're not relevant to the end user. One of these is 1080p super-slow-mo video. Last year, Sony's XZ Premium introduced us to 960 fps clips shot at 720p, though you can only capture them in 0.2-second bursts. But Samsung's Galaxy S9 and Huawei's P20 Pro can do that now too, so Sony's upped the resolution stakes. The trade-off at 1080p is that the slow-mo window has been halved to 0.1 seconds. Don't get me wrong, the feature is cool, but you have to predict what you want to shoot before it happens or you'll miss it -- a bird taking flight, for example. Timing it correctly is like winning the lottery. You can play as much as you want, but you're unlikely to be successful. Shooting at 1080p instead of 720p is like halving your odds, which are already slim. The second unique feature is being able to record 4K HDR video. Again, it sounds cool, but remember you need an HDR TV or monitor to play your movies to get the full benefit. And I can't see any benefit to HDR in this scenario. On the XZ2, the clips I captured were horribly overexposed. These were shot on a sunny day, which is important. Filming the same landscape on an overcast day on the XZ2 Compact resulted in the opposite: dark, underexposed clips. The feature seems to take the dominant characteristic of the scene, light or shadow, and accentuate it massively. Regular 4K clips are much prettier and reliably lit, making the HDR toggle something to avoid. The front-facer is a serviceable, if slightly underwhelming 5-megapixel camera. It depends on how often you imagine using it as to whether this is important or not, as you might understandably expect more from what's effectively a brand-new flagship. It does work with Sony's 3D creator app, though, if you're into rudimentary 3D scans of your face. Performance and battery life User experience is where the XZ2 Compact shines. It has all the top-tier guts of the XZ2 -- including, most importantly, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 chip. It's the Rolls Royce of smartphone processors. Whatever games you prefer, they'll play at the highest graphics settings without skipping a beat. Apps, meanwhile, load up straight away and run smoothly. It's what you wish every phone you'd had before it was like. I found the XZ1 Compact to be frustrating to use, with apps constantly crashing, weird hangs and such. This new little powerhouse is very much a return to form. Perhaps Android 8.0 Oreo has something to do with that, though Sony's slapped its Xperia skin with extra visual customization features on top. But other than a bit of bloatware and a couple of duplicative apps, it's not far off the stock experience. The Compact's battery is a bit smaller than the XZ2's. There's only so much space in that little frame, you see. It still has to power just as many pixels, though, so you'd think battery life might be different across devices, but it's not. In fact, I found that the Compact went a little bit further, draining slightly less charge per round of PUBG Mobile, YouTube session, etc. The contrast isn't stark, and if you're constantly on your phone you'll have to plug it in before the day's out. In other words, battery life is nothing special but also fairly typical. The competition There are two ways you can look at the XZ2 Compact: either as a flagship or as a rare breed of small smartphone. If you think of it as the former, then its main rivals are its bigger brother, the XZ2, and Samsung's Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. I say that because these are the only phones on the market with a Snapdragon 845 chip at the moment. I wouldn't spend my money on anything less at this stage, being seriously impressed with the power of Qualcomm's latest processor. The XZ2 Compact launches in the UK on April 6th for £549, and unfortunately we're still in the dark as to US pricing and availability. I'd guess it will retail for around $650 when it eventually arrives stateside, making it significantly cheaper than its rivals. The XZ2 costs £699 in the UK, so it's a pretty significant savings you're making it you go down the Compact route. The gulf is even wider between the Compact and Samsung's newest phones, which start at £739. If price is important, then the Compact wins out. If size is important, the Compact also wins out. The whole point of the Compact is to serve the underserved. There isn't anything quite like it. The iPhone SE is small, but that hasn't been updated in two years. The Nokia 1 and 2 are small, but they are affordable entry-level devices with spec sheets the Compact laughs at. The iPhone 8 and Pixel 2 are both 5-inch devices, so they're in the mix. The displays on these phones are of the 16:9 variety, though, so both are much bigger than the XZ2 Compact, not to mention offer lower resolutions at substantially higher prices. Wrap-up Sony's Xperia XZ2 Compact is in a class of its own, packing every meaningful feature and component of the XZ2 into a petite, translucent body. I'd even say the device's 5-inch full HD+ display is better than the 5.7-inch equivalent on the XZ2. What's more, the Compact is reasonably priced, which is unusual for Sony. Anyone generally in the market for a new flagship should put it on their short list, and lovers of small but high-performance machines should think about taking the plunge. It's the Compact you've been wanting.","<!-- TAG START { player: ""Eng: Sideview, autoplay, muted"", owner: ""Engadget AOL"", for: ""Engadget AOL"" } --> <!-- TAG END { date: 04/06/18 } --> Smaller smartphones have fallen out of fashion.

The train has two classes of tickets -- executive class and chair car -- and will have differently priced meals, the sources said.
While passengers travelling from New Delhi to Varanasi in the executive class will be charged Rs 399 for morning tea, breakfast and lunch, travellers in the chair car will need to pay Rs 344 for the same.
Those travelling from New Delhi to Kanpur and Prayagraj will have to pay Rs 155 and Rs 122 for executive class and chair car, respectively.
From Varanasi to New Delhi, the passengers will be charged Rs 349 and Rs 288 in the executive class and chair, respectively.

Steve Dent,"Another key feature is in-body, 5-axis stabilization, the first in an X Series model. The X-1H has three axial gyros and a dual-processor that can do 10,000 calculations per second, giving you up to to 5.5 stops of shake reduction, depending on the lens. To further reduce vibration, it has a new leaf-spring shutter-release switch and electronic shutter that Fujifilm calls ""near-silent."" The X-H1 packs an all-new OLED EVF with 0.75x magnification and 3.69 million dot resolution, ""leading the class for APS-C mirrorless cameras,"" Fujifilm said. It has display lag of 0.005 seconds and refreshes at 100 fps -- specs that jibe closely with the EVF on Sony's A7R III, you might notice. The 3-inch display has a 1.04 million dot touch panel that can be tilted in three directions, but Fujifilm didn't say if it can be flipped around for vloggers or selfies. The sub-LCD on top is 1.28 inches wide. With the X-H1, Fujifilm is finally making a serious bid to attract videographers. You can shoot 4,096 x 2,160 DCI, 24fps video, 3,840 x 2,160 at 30p and 1080p at 120fps, with a maximum bit rate of 200 Mbps. That's quite good, but Panasonic's GH5 and GH5s can handle 4K at up to 60 fps, with a 400 Mbps maximum bit rate. Fujifilm didn't say whether the X-H1 can output 10-bit video, which reduces banding and makes color grading easier. Fujifilm also added a 1080p, 120fps mode, F-log SD card recording to smooth workflow, a 12-stop dynamic range setting and a new ""high-sound quality internal microphone"" -- a plus, since the internal mic on the X-T2 is... not good. Lastly, it's offering ""Eterna,"" a film simulation mode ""that is ideal for shooting movies."" If you're wondering if the X-H1 has both microphone and headphone inputs, the answer seems to be ""sort of."" Like the X-T2, there is a microphone input, but if you want a headphone jack, you'll have to pay an extra $300 to get the ""Vertical Power Booster Grip Kit."" As a plus, you do get 30 minutes of extra 4K shooting time and faster burst speeds with that accessory. Other key features include a new ""flicker reduction mode,"" that eliminates strobing and banding under fluorescent and mercury lighting, and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless capability (no sign of WiFi or NFC, though). Fujifilm also unveiled a pair of cinema zoom lenses that match up with the X-H1's new video talents, the Fujinon MKX18-55mm T2.9 and MKX50-135mm T2.9 (T2.9 means F/2.9). Those will run (wait for it) $4,000 and $4,300, respectively. Yes, cinema lenses are always expensive. Luckily, the X-H1 camera itself is a lot more reasonable, less than notable video-specialist mirrorless cameras like the Panasonic GH5, GH5s and Sony A7S II. It will arrive in the US on March 1st for $1,900, or $2,200 with the Vertical Power Booster Grip Kit.","Fujifilm has dropped a hefty gauntlet on rivals with the X-H1, its new flagship APS-C mirrorless that excels at both photography and video.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by George Dvorsky to Gizmodo","Thanksgiving will never be the same for families in Flint, Michigan, the city that made national news in 2015 for its lead-contaminated drinking water. Mae Collins, 50, is no exception. Her annual family tradition has changed drastically since 2014, when city officials switched the city’s drinking water source to the Flint River, turning tap water into brown filth. Since then, using tap water—for cooking, bathing, drinking—has felt like a gamble for Collins, a risky rolling of dice, even now when the state deems the city’s water lead levels acceptable ( while still recommending residents use a filter ). “Why you gon’ tell us to use our filters, but you say all the lead is out the water?” Collins told Earther, speaking to the city’s recommended water instructions. “It’s been a long time since we sat at home and really ate a good holiday dinner.” In the years before the water crisis, Collins used to spend Thanksgiving at home. She kept it more intimate, cooking for her seven kids and her husband’s five kids, not worrying about water bottles or lead. She misses cooking elaborate dinners—homemade mac and cheese, boiled green beans, and, of course, turkey. Since last year, Collins and her family have been heading to her sister’s house in Flint. Everyone is responsible for a single dish. That way, no one has to deal with the overwhelming stress that comes from cooking an entire Thanksgiving dinner water bottle by water bottle. Collins only has to worry about the water required to boil green beans; her husband will handle the frying of the turkey. “It’s been a long time since we sat at home and really ate a good holiday dinner,” Collins said. “Because you don’t feel like moving all that water and cooking.” Water’s not the only new factor, though. Health and nutrition now take a larger seat at the dinner table, too. The menu hasn’t changed much, but there’s a newfound respect for what family members put into their body. There’s also a fear of what will come if families don’t take care of themselves, as some research points to food as a way to keep lead from traveling through the body. “You don’t know, you probably so scared, you wanna’ stay protected,” Collins said about her new habit of eating healthy. “As long as you in Flint, you wanna’ stay protected.” Throughout the city, doctors and nutritionists are offering families a sense of protection through food. Aside from taking extreme caution with the water, fresh fruits and vegetables might be the only way to keep further lead poisoning at bay—especially for the city’s youngest warriors. Junetta Eubanks is another mom in Flint. She knew something was wrong with her water in 2014, as soon as she noticed a rash on two of her children. She’s a 33-year-old mother of six, so she took no risks. She knew the city had switched its water source. From that day on, the family bathed only with a Brita shower head filter and drank only bottled water. “We started doing bottled water instantly, and within a few months, we got a water cooler in our house,” Eubanks told Earther. She’s grateful she and her husband reacted proactively: She was pregnant during the water crisis, and three of her children were younger than 6. Junetta Eubanks and her husband, Ladell. Photo Courtesy of Junetta EubanksDrinking lead-contaminated water that young can change a child’s life forever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say no level of lead in blood is safe for a kid that young, but blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter put a child at an even higher risk for impacts to their brain and nervous system that can delay development and cause comas, convulsions, and even death. Junetta Eubanks and her husband, Ladell. Photo Courtesy of Junetta EubanksAt the time, residents still had no idea how severe the contamination was. Before the water source switch, roughly 2 percent of kids in Flint tested positive for elevated blood levels, according to state data. After? A whopping 7 percent. Flint kids were 50 percent more likely to see their blood levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter while the city was connected Flint River water. Eubanks’ kids saw low blood lead levels, which she attributes to her family’s proactiveness. Still, she won’t take any chances. The family is more committed now to healthy eating than ever, which has instilled a new appreciation for all types of plants. Like kale. The mom never ate the hearty vegetable before she was made aware of its nutritional value. Now she’s always cheffing it up. “I started cooking it like I cook my greens,” she said. “The kids can’t tell difference, and it tastes great.” Everyone knows they should eat healthily; this is true around the world. In Flint, however, eating healthy represents hope. Scientists are just beginning to explore the science behind keeping lead already in the body out of the bloodstream. They do know that low iron is associated with elevated blood lead levels, at least according to some studies. So foods high in iron—like spinach and lentils—should, in theory, help mitigate some negative lead health impacts. Vitamin C is another potential lead fighter, as various bodies of research have shown that children with higher vitamin C intakes have a lower chance of elevated blood lead levels, especially when coupled with high-iron diets. “Some of the recommendations, although they’re good recommendations, they’re not different from what I would recommend, as a nutritionist, to anyone.” Calcium is another mineral that might help mitigate the effects of lead exposure, but the research is conflicting. “It makes sense that low calcium intake would be related to greater lead absorption,” per one analysis, but studies are inconsistent in whether calcium actually keeps lead in the bones and away from other organs. No food, however, can reverse lead exposure. And most lead mitigation studies have been done on kids with higher blood lead levels than those Flint has seen or on animals, as the aforementioned analysis pointed out. To Michigan State University Professor of Food Science and Human Nutrition Amy Saxe-Custack, the science still feels too flimsy to make specific recommendations. “Some of the recommendations, although they’re good recommendations, they’re not different from what I would recommend, as a nutritionist, to anyone,” she told Earther. Saxe-Custack directs nutrition activities with the Pediatric Public Health Initiative Group, a partnership between Michigan State University and the Hurley Medical Center Children’s Hospital that came together last year in light of Flint’s health crisis. The group wants to make sure the city’s children have the best chances for success. Lead in particular poses dangerous risks to a child’s development. It can impact a child’s IQ, ability to pay attention, and academics. Nutrition and early childhood education are what Saxe-Custack and many other professionals say children exposed to lead really need. In Flint, this is easier said than done, though, especially when it comes to good food. The city is what we’d call a food desert. These are neighborhoods the U.S. Department of Agriculture defines as ones that “lack healthy food sources.” For some families, that might look like a grocery store that’s more than a mile away—without access to public transportation. Or maybe a family’s grocery store options are very limited. Flint has seen a pattern of grocery stores closing in recent years. But in wake of the lead crisis, the city isn’t standing by: Community members and public health advocates have rallied to bring fresh healthy foods into Flint. Chef Sean Gartland hosts a six-week long nutrition and cooking class every Tuesday at the Flint Farmers Market. The market’s modernized lead-free water pipe infrastructure makes it an ideal location to prepare food. The catch with the class? It’s just for kids. The current class has 10 kids who range from 8 to 17 years old. Most of them live in Flint, and most are black. The Public Health Initiative Group has been offering the class to parents at the Hurley Medical Center since October, after the group received a $50,000 grant from an anonymous foundation to make it happen. The idea is to teach kids what makes a healthy meal and then give them the tools they need to cook it themselves—after they decide on what they want to cook, of course. This class is indicative of a food revolution in Flint. It’s a culmination of work that kicked off in 2015, immediately after the greater public became aware of the water crisis. Saxe-Custack is there every week to analyze the class, take photos and video, and conduct focus groups. “The kids are really enjoying it,” she said. “We have several picky eaters whose parents want them to come to the class to get them to try more foods and try new foods, so the perception at least is that that’s working. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who helped expose the blood lead levels of Flint’s children, helped spearhead the effort as part of a broader push to help eradicate the city’s food desert issue and foster a sense of wellness. In 2015, the Hurley pediatric clinic, where she works, moved to the new farmers market location downtown. With the farmers market, the clinic, the new cooking class, and the YMCA all near each other, the Wellness Hub was born. Already, research has shown that this new farmers market location drew more residents from “the most distressed neighborhoods,” as a study published last year put it. Now that people like Hanna-Attisha and Saxe-Custack are working together to make this food more affordable, they expect even more low-income and residents of color to buy their groceries at the farmers market. “You don’t have to spend your money on a lot of fruits and vegetables.” One of the ways they’re doing this is through fruit and vegetable prescriptions. Hurley pediatric clinic patients receive a $10 prescription—which is increasing to $15 around December—for fresh fruits and vegetables at the farmers market. Any time they come in for a checkup or doctor’s visit, patients receive a prescription. Saxe-Custack explains that many have come to expect it and ask if a medical resident or doctor forgets to offer. “The parents are reminding them,” Saxe-Custack said. “So they’ll come to the clinic and say, ‘Hey, aren’t I supposed to get a fruit and vegetable prescription?’ And that’s kind of nice, too, that the families are getting used to it and expecting it.” The farmers market is only open on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, but parents can also pick up a produce bag the market produces at the clinic. In 2016, the medical center handed out roughly 4,221 prescriptions with more than 61 percent of parents redeeming the vouchers, per data Saxe-Custack provided Earther. And this isn’t the only place where Flint residents can go to find the foods necessary to cook their Thanksgiving dinner. Two mobile food markets have set up across the city. Flint Fresh, a local food nonprofit, is behind the mobile markets, and it even offers online orders. Saxe-Custack is working with the nonprofit to see how the prescriptions could be used through it, too. This is food that technically costs money, though, even if through a prescription. Free food options exist, too, especially for people who are already receiving federal food assistance. There’s Double Up Food Bucks, which gives users even more money to spend toward fresh fruits and vegetables when they buy foods at participating locations. There are also food pantries; some are even mobile. Two mobile pantries exist in Flint, providing free fruits and vegetables to any resident who wants them. “This is something that’s been going on in the community for a long time,” said Yvonne Lewis, the outreach director for the Genesee Health Plan, to Earther. “But as a result of the water crisis and the lack of access to grocery stores that have fresh fruits and vegetables on a regular basis, more churches and community groups started having them on weekly basis.” Collins is a fan of the food pantries. The food is free, so it makes her life a little bit easier, especially since her household relies on just her husband for income. “There is some good in it,” she said. “You don’t have to spend your money on a lot of fruits and vegetables.” Collins still looks at the holiday season with joy. The memories are deeper than a turkey that required bottles and bottles of water to clean. The time Collins gets to spend with everyone—like her seven sisters—is priceless. She looks forward to her cousins coming in from New York. They didn’t make it last year because of, well, the water. “It was sad, but hopefully they’ll come this year,” she said. If not, she won’t be alone. She’ll have the rest of her family and the love that’s flourished in their homes regardless of what’s spewing out of their faucets. No amount of lead—or empty plastic water bottles—can diminish that.","Thanksgiving will never be the same for families in Flint, Michigan, the city that made national news in 2015 for its lead-contaminated drinking water.

Sam Rutherford,"While better known for its various PCs and gaming products, Asus has been making smartphones for quite some time. Over the previous four generations of Zenfones, Asus had always skipped the world’s largest smartphone trade show, MWC in Barcelona. The reason? According to Asus’ head of global marketing Marcel Campos, “[We] just weren’t ready.” But it seems things are different now, because at MWC 2018, Asus is coming hard with the new Zenphone 5. Available in three different models: The $500 “premium” Zenfone 5Z, the standard Zenfone 5 (price TBA), and the entry-level Zenfone 5 Q (which is called the Zenfone 5 Lite in other countries, also price TBA), Asus’ new phones boast specs that read much like those of industry leaders, including dual rear cameras with a 2x zoom, powerful stereo speakers, face unlock, and a bunch of regular features with “AI” tacked in front, like “AI” charging, and an “AI” display with a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio. The Zenfone 5 even has a notch at the top of its screen similar to the new top product from Timmy Cook’s California Fruit Enterprise. What a novel idea. 1 / 6 But beneath the surface, is Asus actually ready to compete alongside other top-tier smartphones launched at MWC, like Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and Sony’s Xperia XZ2 ? Umm no, not quite. Instead, what we’re really looking at is Asus’ take on a budget iPhone X clone running Android. Look, this isn’t the first time Asus has unabashedly copied a rival product, so we probably shouldn’t be surprised that it’s cribbing heavily from Apple’s playbook. After all, even though its notch looks quite similar, the Zenfone 5 does have slimmer bezels than the iPhone X, which tops out with the screen-to-body ratio of just 82.9 percent. Additionally, while the styling of the new Zenfone’s aren’t particularly creative, I appreciate that Asus added its signature concentric ring styling beneath the glass in back. And unlike the iPhone X, the Zenfone 5 has a headphone jack. (I WILL NEVER FORGET!) What’s much more offensive is the way Asus is recklessly throwing around terms like AI and smart. At a press briefing that went over the details of its new phone, Asus claimed the Zenfone’s dual 12-megapixel rear cameras were flagship class. While it does have Sony’s newly released IMX 363 sensor, the camera sports a max aperture of f/1.8, which is the same as what LG debuted last year on the G6, and half a stop slower than the f/1.5 sensor on the new Galaxy S9. Gosh. But wait, it has dual cameras, surely that’s worth something right? Nope, especially after Alcatel announced a line of phones with dual cameras priced under 100 euros. Then Asus said the Zenfone 5 has an AI camera, which like Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro can use built-in smart to detect certain object and use that knowledge to adjusts your picture. The problem is that when I tried that feature out for real, it was often hit or miss, with the phone getting confused if a cactus qualified as food or a plant. Look, I know people eat cacti all the time, but as pictured, there’s no way I’m not putting that spiky shit in my mouth. Then there’s the Zenfone’s display, which at 6.2-inches across and featuring a 19:9 FHD+ resolution, looked remarkably sharp. But then, Asus ruined it by saying it has an AI display that can automatically correct adjust its color temperature according to your environment. A lot of phones already do this. Apple calls it a True Tone display. It’s a cool feature, but no one else besides Asus says AI is what’s making it happen. Asus says even the phone’s stereo speakers have so-called smart amps. But when I listened them, while they were quite loud, their audio didn’t sound that great. And then there’s the Zenfone 5's “smart screen on” thing, which will override the device’s screen lockout timer to prevent turning off the display if you are still looking at it. I’m sorry, but it doesn’t take much smarts to detect if a face is in front of the screen or not. 1 / 4 Thankfully, at least the Zenfone 5's core specs look good. The top-end Zenfone 5Z will come with a flagship-worthy Snapdragon 845 processor, up to 68GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, that’s not bad. Meanwhile, the less expensive Zenfone 5 and Zenfone 5Q will sport Snapdragon 636, 630 or 430 CPUs, 4GB of 6GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of storage, depending on the model. I even like how Asus got rid of all their redundant first-party software in favor of Google’s standard Android apps, which are what everyone is going to use anyways. The one sad thing is that none of the Zenfone 5 seems to have any sort of water resistance. Oh, and while Asus was copying Apple’s designs, the company also when and made their own Animojis too, which are called, you guessed it, Zenimoji. Overly hyped features and uninspired designs aside, the newest generation of Zenfones actually seem quite nice, especially the 5Z, which might be a downright steal at just $500. But with this bullshit messaging, people may never figure that out over the roar of others crying foul about the misuse of AI. Asus, you don’t need trick us into thinking a phone is super smart for us to realize when we’re getting a good deal. Look for the Zenfones to arrive later this spring and early summer.","While better known for its various PCs and gaming products, Asus has been making smartphones for quite some time.

Rudie Obias,"When you install certain fonts, fine-tune a color scheme, and create call-to-action buttons, you're doing more than just beautifying a website you're increasing its overall trustworthiness. In a study conducted by researchers in the UK, 94% of respondents said they didn't trust a website if it involved complex layouts, small print, boring color choices, and other elements of crappy design.
That study zeroed in on a handful of health websites specifically, but its findings can be applied to virtually any website: good web design matters. A lot.

MARC TRACY,"Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.
College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.
The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyers seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (only) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.
But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyones league.
Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.
Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last years runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Hermans.","Alabama can, in fact, get pummeled, Urban Meyer is not beyond judgment, and other valuable nuggets that will make the game different in the fall.",2019-01-11T18:40:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On College Football: What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/sports/2018-college-football-season.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/sports/13oncollege1/merlin_148723005_9ea6bf1d-3d88-4c1b-9974-8eb6225b1b5f-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1

Sunday is my favorite day of the week, said Ms. Love, who lives in Chelsea. Its just really nice to be in places that arent too overwhelmed. Im always running, on the go, the city is always busy, so to feel the city when its less busy means a lot to me.
TEA, NEWS AND PREP When I wake up at 7, the city is quiet. You almost feel like the only one up, and I like that feeling. I am not a breakfast person, so Ill have a cup of tea and catch up on news, engage with the social media community; Ill go over my Nets scripts to prepare for games that week.

GET PUMPED I go to the 9:30 service at Redeemer Downtown on 14th Street, and I love hearing the sermon. It grounds me, reminds me how great God has been to me, my family and friends, and I leave more knowledgeable. Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer in Manhattan, is a well-known author, so I knew I wanted to check out his teaching when I came to New York. I found Redeemer and fell in love with the Bible-based teaching. Thats a priority to me. We can all preach on feelings, but teaching on truth is what I live for, and learn from.

SPIRIT AND BODY Right after church, I walk to 23rd Street and teach a 12:45 class at Peloton. Its a live class that is broadcast to all bikes and app members. Its literally my Feel Good Ride the name of the class as it allows me to bridge the gap of how great I feel from church and being on the bike, working out with thousands of riders at the same time, inspiring them through uplifting and encouraging language. I love Peloton because of its community. Its not only the leader in the hybrid of technology and fitness, but we are able to build social relationships that are magnified both on the bike, which uses a leader board that syncs with other riders, and off the bike, through real friendships across the country.
A LITTLE BUSINESS Ill get off my bike around 1:30 and meet with Faye Farrales, who helps me run Love Squad. Its really informal on Sundays, but were a small business, so its important to work in those off-peak hours and get ahead of the game so we know what were doing and build a strategy for the upcoming week.

HANG I meet my friends around 2:30 or 3 for afternoon brunch. My favorite place is Joseph Leonard on Waverly Place in the West Village. Theres usually a wait, so we have some drinks at the bar before sitting down. And it really depends on how much fun were having, but brunch can end anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30. When its over, Ill go home to change and meet my boyfriend, Andrew.

THE BOYFRIEND Andrew and I see each other every day. I start my mornings with him, and sometimes on Sundays he joins for church, and he often comes to class, as well, but we always meet up for comedy and dinner. At 8 we go to the stand-up show at the Village Underground on Third Street. We love to laugh, so comedy is perfect we thoroughly enjoy and respect those who can get up, live, and make people laugh. Making people laugh on the spot is real talent. Anyone can tell one good joke, but very few people can thread jokes together to tell a story, be impactful, and just make it super funny. My favorite comics include Hasan Minhaj, Stephen Colbert, Kevin James. After the show, we always go around the corner to Mint Masala on Macdougal Street for amazing Indian food. We love the curry chicken and lamb rogan josh.

Nicole Gallucci,"In the wake of yet another tragic school shooting, teachers have started an eye-opening movement on social media to let the world know what preventative measures really need to be taken seriously to protect students. In response to the recent mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, President Trump suggested that some teachers receive gun training so they can be armed in their classrooms. But rather than adding more guns to educational environments, teachers are using the hashtag #ArmMeWith to share far more peaceful resources they wish to be armed with, such as school supplies, mental health resources and funding, impactful changes in curriculum, and stronger gun control legislation. SEE ALSO: Donald Trump thinks he's the first person to come up with movie ratings The movement was started by two educators: Brittany Wheaton, a teacher in Utah, and Olivia Bertels from Kansas. Both 27-year-olds met through Instagram, according to Buzzfeed, and eagerly asked the online teacher community to share their personal thoughts on how to ensure the safety and proper education of students. Teachers across the U.S. have been using the hashtag. One high school English teacher requested a ""curriculum that tells the truth, the ability to teach the truth, a society that believes the truth, and political leaders who make laws based on the truth."" Others asked to be armed with more on-site mental health professionals, like school counselors and social workers, as well as self-care classes, bullet-proof glass, an enhanced library, and a range of other resources that focus on the physical, mental, and emotional care of students and faculty members. This is a movement that I can 100% get on board with. If you’ve heard me talk about my class size the last couple years, you will not be surprised that this is one of my hot button issues. In the mind of children, negative attention is still attention, and I believe that as we raise class sizes, overload teachers, and cut support, we will continue to see major behavioral, social, and emotional issues rise to unparalleled levels. I think that reaching out to educators about ways that we can be PROactive, not reactive, in the education world to reduce violence of any kind is absolutely one of the best places to start making a change!..... #ArmMeWith #RealTalk #IssuesInEducation #iTeach2nd #iTeach3rd #TeacherLife #TeachersOfInstagram #TeacherCommunity #TargetTeachers A post shared by Kelly Bates (@buildingbrilliance) on Feb 20, 2018 at 5:58pm PST It isn’t enough to teach our children how to read.

JIM TANKERSLEY and BEN CASSELMAN,"Those losses included a drubbing in the districts where the SALT deduction is most heavily claimed. Democrats won 10 of the 20 Republican-held districts where the largest proportion of taxpayers claim the deduction, including seats in California, Virginia and New Jersey. Some Democratic challengers in those districts criticized the SALT limit on the campaign trail. Still, there is little evidence to suggest that SALT alone tipped those districts toward Democrats, who largely focused on health care in their policy pitch to voters. The SALT provision appears to have gone largely unmentioned in Democratic attack ads: Researchers at the Wesleyan Media Project compiled a full report on mentions of tax issues in House campaigns, and SALT did not appear anywhere in their findings. Democrats dont have much chance of repealing the cap in the next two years, because Republicans still hold the Senate and the White House. Even if they controlled the whole government, Democrats might struggle to repeal the caps because they would be, in effect, reversing a tax increase on well-off Americans. Simply reinstating the unlimited cap, without also reversing the changes to the alternative minimum tax, would deliver no benefit to low-income and middle-class Americans, according to a new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank. More than 85 percent of the benefits would go to the top 5 percent of American income earners. The top 1 percent of income earners would see an average tax cut of $35,000 each.

STEPHANIE SAUL and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS,"Many districts and schools that are tolerating, if not encouraging, participation in what organizers call the National School Walkout are also calibrating their approach for their youngest students. In New York City, middle and high school students may walk out of class with approval from a parent, such as with a permission slip, but elementary school students cannot leave unless a parent or guardian comes to check them out. At Woods Cross Elementary School in Woods Cross, Utah, students will be allowed to leave class at 10 a.m. and go to the gym for 17 minutes, the same starting time and duration (one minute for every victim in Parkland, Fla.) as other walkouts around the country. Parents may also check them out of the school during that time, and they will not be penalized. Photo Craig Sampsell with his fifth-grade students at Case Elementary as they made posters for the upcoming walkout. Credit Dustin Franz for The New York Times “We’re giving them an opportunity to express their First Amendment rights in a safe place,” said Rachel Peterson, a physical education teacher at the school who is also safety commissioner for the state board of the Utah PTA. In suburban Nashville, David L. Snowden, director of schools for the Franklin Special School District, sent an email to families saying that the district had decided that it would not be appropriate for students in its elementary schools, which run through fourth grade, to participate in the walkout, but that students in grades five and up could join. In an interview, Dr. Snowden said he was not concerned that very young children would be frightened by the walkout, only that they would not understand what it was about. “Sometimes I think when you’re teaching children, especially younger children, you try to take into consideration, will there be a full understanding of what they’re doing and why they’re doing it,” he said. “Just to walk out of class for 17 minutes, I’m not sure what that is really teaching.” Even within Akron’s 50-school district, agendas for Wednesday differed markedly from school to school. At Firestone Park Elementary, students were expected to read a poem about peace. At Pfeiffer Elementary, students would be reviewing safety procedures. And at Robinson Community Learning Center there were no plans at all — students had not expressed an interest, according to the district. Elise Cappella, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at New York University’s Steinhardt School, said there was a difference between what the youngest students — from kindergarten to second grade — and older children could understand. While not advocating any particular stance, she said: “Schools could make the decision that kids in kindergarten through second grade are not provided the opportunity to walk out. They are cognitively, socially, emotionally younger. They may feel more fear about it and less understanding.” Children in the third grade and up, she said, will be more likely to be exposed to news and hear their parents talking about it. “They are reaching a point where having something that’s potentially positive and productive to do that makes them feel a sense of agency and safety could be a good thing,” she said. Ms. Cappella said that whether elementary schools decided to participate in the protest or not, the goal should be to project a sense of community to their students. “And if you can create that space,” she said, “whether that’s in the classroom or in the hallways or in the schoolyard or out at a protest or a march, that’s the most beneficial space for young kids to be in.” Photo Notes on a whiteboard about the coming walkout at Case Elementary, where activities will vary by grade. Credit Dustin Franz for The New York Times Some school districts, generally in conservative areas, are trying to discourage any type of school walkout, regardless of age, warning that any student who participates will be marked as absent from class. Even some schools where demonstrations are being allowed are being careful about the tone. Ms. Peterson, of Woods Cross in Utah, said that there was no program planned for the assembly — the students would be able to express themselves as long as they were not rowdy or disruptive. “We are teachers and not necessarily there to make a political statement in that time,” she said. “Whatever is decided by students in that time and space, we will allow it to happen as long as it is peaceable and respectful.” If some students who stayed behind expressed surprise or bafflement at their classmates leaving the room, she said, teachers would use their own tact and judgment about how to explain it. “The way I would word it is that some kids are walking out to show support for lessening school violence, in honor of the people in Florida,” Ms. Peterson said. Joel Pelcyger, head and founder of the PS1 Pluralistic School, a private school in Santa Monica, Calif., consulted with parents before deciding that observing the walkout was not a political statement, but a way to empower his students and make them feel safe, regardless of age. “The way you make people safe is by feeling that like they’re part of something larger than themselves,” he said. But in Alexandria, Va., when one school decided that fifth graders could join the walkout if their parents signed them out, a parent lodged her own form of protest. This is being organized by groups that want to ban all guns and are demanding congress act. Kids shouldn’t be used as props. — Julie Gunlock (@JGunlock) March 2, 2018 “My elementary school has 5-year-olds in it,” the parent, Julie Gunlock, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Independent Women’s Forum, said in an interview. “Some of my friends, their kids are much younger than a fifth grader. And it’s frightening to them.” Maeva Lile, 11, one of the fifth-grade organizers at Case Elementary in Akron, said that most of her friends were aware of the gun-control debate and thought that AR-15s, the powerful rifle used in Parkland and other mass shootings, should not be legal. But she said her class did not want to debate the Second Amendment, and so its posters will simply honor the students killed in Parkland with their names. Still, she thought it was time for children to do something. “Adults have been protesting against things,” she said on Monday, “but nothing has changed that much.” Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

Megan Rose Dickey,"In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees. This, of course, has been an ongoing conversation within the gig economy.
Those who work as 1099 contractors can set their own schedules, and decide when, where and how much they want to work. For employers, bringing on 1099 contractors means they can avoid paying taxes, overtime pay, benefits and workers compensation.
As Lyft notes in the S-1, this conversation has resulted in a number of lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and more.
“The tests governing whether a driver is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive,” Lyft states in its S-1. “Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in such legal and administrative proceedings, but our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful.”
In the event Lyft is forced to reclassify its drivers, that could result in a number of new financial burdens for the company. That includes:
Expense reimbursement
A potential injunction prohibiting Lyft from continuing its current business practices
Claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation and unemployment
Monetary exposure relating to failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages, and wage and hour law requirements
Lyft goes on to note that reclassifying its drivers as W-2 workers “may require us to significantly alter our existing business models and operations.” And this is one of those risks that could very easily happen.
As Lyft points out, it’s actively involved in six class-action lawsuits pertaining to driver classification. And the company has already settled a couple of lawsuits to the sum of $27 million in 2013, and $1.95 million in 2018. Meanwhile, California is actively examining this issue in Assembly Bill 5, which would improve protections and rights for gig economy workers. That bill was introduced in light of a groundbreaking state Supreme Court decision in April.","In Lyft’s S-1 this morning, the company laid out the potential consequences for converting its drivers from independent contractors to W-2 employees.

RICHARD FAUSSET,"Mr. Almond, 53, is a soft-spoken man who graduated in 1990 from Morehouse College. His mother was a postal worker, and his father was not in the picture when he was a child. His own journey from matriculation to graduation was a complicated one that took eight years. “This is personal for me,” he said. “It’s one of those rare things in life where you get to work for an organization whose mission and vision is so much aligned with your own personal mission.” Georgia State’s graduation ceremony took place in the Atlanta Braves’ former stadium, bought by the college in 2016 and converted into a football field festooned in royal blue, the school color. Ms. Jones took her place with others from her graduating class — strangers, mostly, from an array of backgrounds, some with stories that could be the plots of novels. Dulce Arizmendi, 22, earned a business degree even though her mother, the only parent who raised her, was deported to Mexico in her junior year (“Gracias mami,” her cap declared). Abraham Chung, 28, lived in Georgia until he was 5, then moved to South Korea after his father was the victim of an Atlanta jewelry-store robbery. When Mr. Chung returned at age 17, he had forgotten most of his English, and it took him a decade to complete a finance degree. After Ms. Jones walked across the stage, she could not say what her long-term future might hold: Criminal justice was one of many interests.

FINN COHEN,"I was in Los Angeles [on set] for five months, and maybe this says it all: I had chunks of time off, but I could never come back to New York as Adora. For some reason, I couldn’t be home in my New York apartment as Adora. Something took over me. I don’t want to sound like a “pretentious actor,” but this character infiltrated me in a way that was very hard — by Episode 5, I could not extricate myself from the sheer brutality, and yet sadness and excruciating pain, that I felt sometimes physically. I had to get those nails off, I had to realign myself. I had to shift my organs. [Laughs.] I had to just let go and come back to Patricia here in New York City, which is a different life than Adora in Wind Gap. Had you had that experience with a character before? I have at times, but they are few and far between. I’d say the last time it got like this — of course playing Blanche [ DuBois, from “A Streetcar Named Desire” in 2004], because you never recover from playing Blanche. I don’t think it’s anything rare, or special; it’s just what happens in our lives as actors. But Adora, it was episodic, so scene to scene, episode to episode, storm clouds gathered. And I needed a poncho. [Laughs.] As we get to know her, it becomes apparent that she’s really just an open wound — there’s so much trauma in her life. Which I can imagine is a difficult thing to embody for a long period of time. It is. I’m fortunate to come from a very good family, very good parents, very middle-class, very All-American. I had unconditional love, which is something that I cannot imagine living without. So that’s where I began with Adora, a woman who I don’t think ever had true, real love, and who had this generational violence, and trauma, and abuse that has been with her for so long. It was literally breathtaking to play her. The air goes out of the room at times with Adora, and it has to. It becomes this claustrophobic, insular world where you think no one will escape. The scene where she tells Camille she never loved her is one of the most devastating, because it’s also the nicest that Adora is been to Camille up until that point.","Over eight episodes, Ms. Clarkson’s character is revealed to be much more than just a domineering matriarch.",2018-08-27T03:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Patricia Clarkson: ‘Sharp Objects’ Included ‘Some of the Toughest Scenes I’ve Played’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/arts/television/patricia-clarkson-sharp-objects-hbo.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/28/arts/27clarkson/27clarkson-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
Ana Luisa Suarez,"Have you ever flown first class? You get to the airport early and pray to see your name up on the board, on that list of ""next in line for upgrades"" and hope you're in the top 5 slot. Because who has the money to actually pay for first class? No one wants to spend $1,000 (plus) to fly for 3 hours. When airline tickets are already so expensive, the last thing you want to do is spend extra money just to see at the front of the plane. Sure, first class has more legroom, always has a TV (when some economy seats do not), and gets the better drink and dining service. But is it really all that worth it? The answer is ""yes"" to some, but probably ""no"" to many. If you're going to spend the extra cash, it is probably on economy plus, right? Well, now you can splurge and it won't kill your wallet. AURA is a luxury private airline club that is offering first class tickets at an incredibly low price. Honestly, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not fly with this airline. AURA isn't flying just yet, but in 2019 flights across the globe will be taking place. You can sign up for their Founding Keyholder plan by paying a one time fee (currently on sale for $100, instead of $250). That includes fixed fares, a waived keyholder fee, a reduced monthly payment, discounts with partners, and more. AURA is a deliberate effort to create a beautiful flying experience. No aircraft on the market today was designed for what we set out to accomplish, so we had to go design one ourselves. ZED Aerospace crafted AURA to be the most advanced fleet in the sky, unveiling the most modern technologies never before seen on aircraft. AURA isn't about cutting corners or shaving costs, it's about delivering an experience worthy of Five Stars. Some first class fares are under $300 already – a flight from Atlanta to Chicago is $280, while a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles is $580, and a flight from NYC to Miami is $380. And these are all private airline fares! There are only going to be 29 seats aboard the plane and they're broken into two flight classes, First and Wave. Don't let the First name fool you, that actually isn't the first class option, Wave is. Each seat will offer at least 44 inches of room (which is inches over other airlines first class options, which are between 36 and 42""). The premium Wave seating even has chairs that can lay completely flat. The flights comes with complimentary WiFi and iPad pro at every seat. You can look into signing up to be a member at AURA here !

Catherine Shu,"A federal judge denied Teslas motion to dismiss charges in a lawsuit claiming that it mistreated foreign workers. This means the automaker will have to defend itself at trial against allegations that foreign workers at its Fremont factory worked shifts that violated forced labor laws and were threatened with deportation if they reported injuries. The ruling comes just a few days after Elon Musk agreed to resign as Teslas chairman (while staying on as its CEO) to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC filed a complaint in federal district court last week charging Musk with fraud related to his tweets in August that he planned to take Tesla private at $420 a share. In a ruling made on Monday, Judge Lucy Koh of California Northern District Court in San Jose dismissed five out of seven claims in the lawsuit, Lesnik v. Eisenmann SE (case number 5:16-cv-01120), and denied motions to dismiss from Tesla subcontractors Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem. Other vehicle makers (Mercedes-Benz, Deere, REHAU, LaX, Volkswagen, Dicastal, and BMW) were also named as defendants, but dismissed because they arent included in the two claims that will go to trial. The class action lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Gregor Lesnik, from Slovenia, and Stjepan Papes, from Croatia, on behalf of foreign workers covered by B-1 visas. Both Lesnik and Papes were hired by ISM Vuzem and sent to the U.S. to work at Teslas Fremont facility. The suit alleges that foreign workers were paid far below minimum wage and worked extreme hours. Lesnik claims that he typically worked 12 hours a day and never less than 10 hours, over 80 hours a week, adding up to more than 240 hours a month, but only received one day off every two weeks, in violation of forced labor laws. When Lesnik was too sick to work or reported a job injury, the suit alleges Vuzem threatened to withhold pay or visa and immigration benefits. Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann are not liable for abuses by ISM Vuzem because they benefitted financially. Teslas auto manufacturing plant in Fremont was scrutinized last year after complaints by employee Jose Moran, which were denied by CEO Elon Musk in a staff email. Earlier this year, Californias Division of Occupational Safety and Health said it would look into conditions at the factory after R eveal reported that Tesla did not accurately report work injuries, as required by state and federal law (charges Tesla also denied ). While its labor and safety practices were being criticized, other workers also filed several lawsuits alleging racial discrimination and harassment at the Fremont plant.

Jason Parham,"The prowess of a Jordan Peele film reveals itself in the dive. With Get Outhis Oscar-winning 2017 social thriller about brain-swapping white liberals and their obsession with black bodiesPeele explored what it meant to descend into, and ultimately be trapped by, the dark vista of the mind. What unfurled was a cerebral madhouse of tangled racial horrors. It felt true. Especially true if, like Daniel Kaluuya's character Chris Washington, you are forced to live in the world merely as a consequence to mischievous white purveyors. Peele is likewise consumed by the crescendo, the ascent. He is just as eager to detail the rise from psychological or physical terror to a place of safety. What the writer-director-producer ultimately privileged in Get Outwas it the fall or the climb?is much harder to parse; the project lends itself to a dense canniness.
Yet, the sum of Peele's work isn't uniquely about the summit or the slopethey're mostly just devices he employs to great effect, hallmarks of a growing mastery. His films' elucidation, then, lies in the context in which those emotions take place. He is someone who appreciates the complexities of the metaphorical rabbit hole. How deep it runs. Where it takes his characters (and, by extension, viewers). What we take from it. Its cavernous toll on the body and the mind in moments of escape or bold embrace. With Us, his latest horror puzzle, Peele continues to burrow furiously into the sinister subterranean of the American project.
With the unsettling slink of a classic horror flick, Us's prologue opens in 1986 in the lazy California beach town Santa Cruz. During a trip to the local boardwalk, an elementary-age Adelaide (a hypnotic Madison Curry) becomes curiously enthralled by a carnival attraction (a credit to Peele's guile, the entrance perfectly forebodes: ""Find Yourself""). Alone, having wandered off from her father, she roams the mysterious hall of mirrors and is taken in by her reflection. Literally. Adelaide is greeted by an exact, living, breathing replica of herself. The encounter is so jarring she flees in what we are meant to believe is a moment of panic. The experience, which is only hinted at in the opening exhales of the movie but comes into full view much later, leaves her with permanent lacerations. When we meet Adelaide as an adult (Lupita Nyong'o in her first lead role) she's married with two kidsZora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex)but the trauma of the experience has irrevocably scarred her psyche. A family road trip back to the same beachside town threatens to rip the wound wide open. This being a Jordan Peele undertaking, it doesn't take long for the blood to pool.
The one contemporary fracture the film is clear on is the poison of class struggle: the eternal fight between those at the top and those at the bottom, the above versus below.
There are, to my count, three key moments of descent in Us. The first begins after the Wilsons return from a day at the beach. They're at home when, unexpectedly, the lights cut. Outside in the driveway looms a family of four, eerily identical to the Wilsons. Adelaide's husband Gabe (Black Panther's Winston Duke) lobs physical threats, warning he will ""get crazy,"" but the family is unmoved by his faux-machismo (he's a lovable goof at heart). The twist, of course, is that these invaders are also the Wilsons. Young Adelaide from the boardwalk funhouse has grown into Red, a gravelly-voiced, remorseless matriarch. She's an inverse, darkness to the light of the Adelaide we have come to know, a shadow made flesh. As it turns out, each member of the Wilson clan has an evil doppelgänger, cracked mirror versions of their real selves. They call themselves the Tethered.
The second descent happens when it is revealed that the Wilsons are not the only ones haunted by malevolent, blood-thirsty clones. Everyone in town is. Overnight, Santa Cruz is animated by deaththe Tethered have risen from the tunnels to enact revenge on their above-ground selves. The carnage is instantly volcanic: Once it detonates, the spill is impossible to contain and the radius of doom seems to expand by the minute. Even as the ruin curdles, it allows Peele to flex his penchant for humor. (A highlight: During a moment of frantic escape, the Wilsons take a moment to bicker over who has the most kills. It's Gabe, with two.)
By now, the film has shed more of its layersit's a home invasion thriller involves a zombie-like apocalypsebut it does so at the expense of leaving viewers dizzy, even as it scatters references to horror staples The Shining, Jaws, and A Nightmare on Elm Street in its wake. That's not to say Us lacks for control, the film is not as loose as it occasionally feels, though it is at times derailed by its insistence on brevity. Perhaps that's intentional. On The Ringer's Big Picture podcast, Peele referred to Us as ""a bit more of a Rorschach than my last picture. It's really about looking within.""
Whatever the case, Peele extends his audience too much credit this time around. All of the film's stray pointsWhy do the Tethered wear red jumpsuits and carry golden scissors? Exactly how many of them exist? When did they first come to be?never add up. The one contemporary fracture the film is clear on is the poison of class struggle: the eternal fight between those at the top and those at the bottom, the above versus below. This divide, the feeling of being left behind, is what fuels Red's venomous hate.
The final descent, though, delivers one of the most striking notes in Us. It's what the film is rocketing towards from its start, a fated and fatal end point: a gruesomely poetic standoff between Adalaide and Red. It is also, to Peele's credit, a literal descent. Adelaide ventures deep into an underground bunker to rescue Jason, where Red is waiting. Their fight is beautifully intercut with flashbacks of teenage Adelaide performing at a ballet recital. Cinematically, all the notes hitthe swift, curved shots; the slow villainous lurch of ""I Got 5 on It""; the tug of Nyong'o's eyes, those cracked watery pearls that ache with pathos, the way they demand full surrender. If Us is a film that privileges swelland it very much is, sometimes to a faulthere, Peele embraces that bloat with brilliance and flair.
In the film's closing scene it's revealed, with a wink and a rascal of a smile, that the Adelaide who traveled into the bunker was not quite the same Adelaide who rose from it. And in that, we may very well have the most enduring message in Peele's cinematic oeuvreone that neither situates his work as a grand class parable or a genre-thrashing racial thrillerthat even if we are lucky enough to escape, to ascend from the rabbit hole of our own private hells, there is no way we are ever free from the transformation that has taken hold within us.

George Dvorsky,"Using a computer powered by an off-the-shelf Intel Core i5-6600 processor, a FedEx employee from Tennessee has discovered the largest prime number known to humanity. At 23,249,425 digits long, it’s nearly a million digits longer than the previous record holder. For those of you who failed or have long forgotten grade 3 math class, a prime number is any number that can only be divided by 1 and itself (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.). It’s a freaky quirk of the Universe that has captivated mathematicians for centuries, as their appearance in the roll call of all integers defies prediction ( though biases have been detected in the distribution of consecutive primes ). Finding prime numbers thus requires a bit of trial-and-error, patience, and a lot of computing power. The new record-holding prime number, dubbed “M77232917,” was discovered by Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old electrical engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, on December 26, 2017. It was discovered as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a group that does exactly what its name implies. Mersenne primes—named after the 17th century French monk Marin Mersenne—are a rare class of primes that are one integer less than a number that’s been multiplied by itself, expressed as M n =2 n -1. In this case, the new prime was calculated by multiplying 77,232,917 by 77,232,917 and then subtracting one (2 77,232,917 -1). The new prime is the 50th known Mersenne prime. M77232917 contains 23,249,425 digits, which is practically impossible for the human brain to comprehend. You can download a zip file of the number here, which busts open into a simple text file nearly 24 MB in size.

You get the point. According to GIMP, that’s big enough to fill an entire shelf of books totalling 9,000 pages. Or put another way, “If every second you were to write five digits to an inch then 54 days later you’d have a number stretching over 73 miles (118 km)—almost 3 miles (5 km) longer than the previous record prime,” writes GIMP. Pace, a long-time math enthusiast and a current employee at FedEx, does charity work as a SysAdmin, running Prime95 on all his PCs and servers; Pace is one of thousands of volunteers who are using free GIMPS software in the effort to continually find larger and larger prime numbers. The PC that Pace used to find the prime number required six straight days of computation on a quad-core Intel i5-6600 CPU to verify it. Indeed, the discovery of new primes is no small task; every candidate prime must go through the time-consuming and rigorous process of being cut-up by any potential divisors. Once a candidate prime is discovered, it has to be verified by outside sources. In this case, the prime was independently verified by four different programs running on different hardware configurations: Aaron Blosser verified it using Prime95 on an Intel Xeon server in 37 hours. David Stanfill verified it using gpuOwL on an AMD RX Vega 64 GPU in 34 hours Andreas Höglund verified the prime using CUDALucas running on NVidia Titan Black GPU in 73 hours Ernst Mayer also verified it using his own program Mlucas on 32-core Xeon server in 82 hours. Andreas Höglund also confirmed using Mlucas running on an Amazon AWS instance in 65 hours. The quest to find more prime numbers may seem frivolous, but they hold practical applications as well, such as the generation of public key cryptography algorithms, hash tables, and as random number generators. Further work into primes could also tell us a bit more about mathematics and why it’s so damned good at describing the universe. And as Carl Sagan speculated in Cosmos, transmitting streams of consecutive primes could also be used as a way of saying “hello” to an alien civilization. As exciting as this discovery is, the Holy Grail of primes is yet to be found: a prime number containing 100 million digits. The first person to find this elusive number will be awarded $150,000 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Good luck!

"Kim Kelly on Skillet, shared by Kim Kelly to Lifehacker","As a bookish, curious kid growing up in a rural, working class area in the 90s, my life revolved around three things: my soccer team, the library, and Pizza Hut. The latter two were intrinsically connected for reasons I will explain shortly (and the first certainly helped burn off the calorific aftereffects of the last). See, for six glorious months out of the year, I had access to the most wonderful scam. 
How do I build a steady reading habit? asks redditor 6hlooo on r/TrueAskReddit. I was always the 
Read more Read
Every week, I could bring in a little slip of paper with the names of three books Id read, along with my moms signature, and get a special stamp from my teacher, who was always slightly suspicious of how regularly I did this but couldnt ignore the constant piles of books on my little desk. Once my paperwork was in order, then came the exciting part: taking my signed slip to the Pizza Hut a few towns over and exchanging it for a free kid-sized pizza, which I then got to eat all by myself.
It was absolutely magical, and was also a huge help to my parents, who werent exactly swimming in lets take the kids out for lunch money. It was called BOOK IT! and grifting my way to an endless supply of free pizza (and being rewarded for my nerdy habit) remains one of my fondest memories.
Id assumed that, much like my childlike innocence and the illusion of American democracy, BOOK IT! had died out sometime in the early 2000s due to lack of interest, consigned to the graveyard of corporate history. But, guess what? I was wrong. Pizza Hut still does this! Thats right: This beloved program is alive and well, and they even have a weirdly intense website all set up to help teachers and parents track their kids progress.
BOOK IT! is exquisitely elegant in its simplicity: teachers set monthly reading goals, and children who meet said goals are rewarded with free pizza. Students in elementary and home schools in K-6 grades (ages 5-12) are eligible, and parents are encouraged to read along with children who were not yet reading on their own (it still counts towards pizza). I remember being absolutely furious when I aged out of the program, but luckily I had a little sister on hand, and read fast enough to keep the two of us rolling in pizza for years to come.
So, adults and big siblings of America, take note: If you have kids in your life and either want to encourage them to read more, or have a hungry bookworm on your hands, take a page out of Pizza Huts book, and indulge in some good old-fashioned bribery.","As a bookish, curious kid growing up in a rural, working class area in the 90s, my life revolved around three things: my soccer team, the library, and Pizza Hut.

"Nicole Dieker on Two Cents, shared by Nicole Dieker to Lifehacker","How much is your side hustle currently bringing in? How much do you think itll earn this year, based on your first-quarter revenue?
(Ill wait while you do the math.)
Next question: how much are you spending on your side hustle? Is it more or less than what youre earning?
Gross income is great, but the new tax laws have gotten a lot stricter on whether you can deduct those expenses youre racking up as you pursue your side hustle. This means that if your side hustle isnt hustling up a profit, you might have to classify it as a hobbyand lose out on potential tax savings.
Freelancers and side hustlers: how much money do you want to make this year?
Read more Read
The basic business vs. hobby rules are still the same: to qualify as a business, you need to make a profit in three out of the past five years. To quote IRS Publication 535: 
An activity is presumed carried on for profit if it produced a profit in at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. 
(Theres an exception for people who breed, show, train, or race horsesthey only have to show a profit for two out of the last seven years, probably because horses are expensive.)
If your side hustle qualifies as a business, youll report your income and expenses on a Schedule C and will be able to deduct qualified business expenses from your taxes. That also remains unchanged.
However, taxpayers used to be able to itemize and deduct some hobby expenses from their taxes as well, even if their money-making endeavor didnt qualify as an official small business. As The Washington Post reports, the new tax laws have eliminated that deduction:
In the past, you could claim hobby expenses as part of the class of miscellaneous itemized deductions that needed to exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income, [IRS spokesperson Eric Smith] said. But that category of deductions was eliminated under tax reform.
Previously, you could deduct expenses from a hobby up to the income it generated as personal itemized deductions, as long as you met the 2 percent threshold. However, starting in 2018 and up until 2025, this deduction is no longer allowed.
What does that mean for you? If your side hustle has more expenses than income, and you havent earned a profit in three out of the past five years, youll have to classify it as a hobby.
If you are starting a side hustle and it hasnt made a profit yetbut you think it might earn a profit in three out of the next five yearsyou can file IRS Form 5213, Election To Postpone Determination as To Whether the Presumption Applies That an Activity Is Engaged in for Profit.
(If youve read all of this and feel more confused than when you started, you can always hire a CPA or tax preparer to help you.)
Most importantly: if your side hustle isnt bringing in any profit, you can start cutting business expenses or working on growing your income. Do it for the sake of your businesss bottom lineor your own bottom line, because that money youre spending on an unprofitable business is probably coming out of your own pocketand do it for the sake of your tax return.
Or, you could always accept that your side hustle is really a side hobby. Not every hobby has to become a full-fledged business, after all.

Harish Jonnalagadda,"Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro in India on February 14, and both models are now available for purchase in the country. The Redmi Note 5 starts off at just ₹9,999 for the 3GB variant with 32GB of storage, with the Redmi Note 5 Pro coming in at ₹13,999 for the version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Both phones feature 5.99-inch 18:9 displays and come with 4000mAh batteries that offer class-leading battery life. They're also running MIUI 9 out of the box, but the ROM is based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and not Oreo. As a refresher, the Redmi Note 5 retains most of the internal hardware as its predecessor, but you do get a significantly improved 12MP camera at the back. Other hardware includes a Snapdragon 625 chipset, 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (for ₹11,999), and a 5MP front shooter with LED flash. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is the more interesting option, as it is the first phone in the world to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 platform. If the early benchmarks are any indication, it is a performance beast. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also has dual cameras at the back, and they're fantastic. In addition to the dual rear cameras, the Redmi Note 5 Pro has a 20MP front camera with LED flash and the latest version of Beautify, which automatically removes blemishes from selfies. The phone also has Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 5.0, and while there's no USB-C or fast charging, the rest of the features more than make up for it. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is available with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for ₹13,999, and Xiaomi is also releasing a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for ₹16,999. The 6GB option will be making its debut at a later date, but you can pick up the 4GB variant of the Redmi Note 5 Pro right now. Considering the Redmi Note 5 Pro costs just ₹2,000 more than the 4GB model of the Redmi Note 5, you're better off getting the former. You get a much better camera (both front and rear), and the Snapdragon 636 platform makes it the fastest device in the budget segment today.

ALEX MARSHALL,"The project has taken a long time to prepare, partly because it involved getting permission from every school and parent. Eventually, 30 photographers will work on the project; six have already been recruited and will start work immediately. Mr. McQueen will brief each one, but he will not take photographs himself. “I’ll leave it to the professional photographers,” he said. Mr. McQueen is well known as an artist in Britain, having won the Turner Prize, the country’s major contemporary art award, in 1999. In 2007, he created “ Queen and Country,” a project aiming to put the face of every member of the British military who died in Iraq on a postage stamp. The Royal Mail did not commission the stamps, so the piece exists as a cabinet-like installation, with drawers that pull out to reveal sheets of stamps. Mr. McQueen said he would not have a hard time explaining his latest project to the children involved if he had to. “I think people often think they’re insignificant,” he said, explaining that the photographs were a way of making a different point: “You’re important — I want to take a photograph of you.” Young people will also grasp the significance of the project when their photographs go on display in one of the world’s leading art institutions, he said. “ I remember well when I was 5 and I had a painting of mine exhibited in the local library.” Maria Balshaw, the Tate’s director, said in an interview that she thought Mr. McQueen had seen in the project a “sense of showing future creative potential which is there in every class.” She said she hoped the work would highlight the importance of arts education in Britain, which has been suffering because of government funding cuts. “In the 1970s, I was at an open-plan, arts-centered primary school that allowed every lesson to have the arts in it, and I’m certain that set us on a road where a sense of creative agency was part of our lives,” she said.","Steve McQueen at Tate Britain in London on Tuesday. “I just wanted to reflect back on a certain point in my life where things changed and things churned,” he said.",2018-09-18T14:13:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Steve McQueen’s Next Project: Thousands of School Photographs,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/arts/design/steve-mcqueen-art-children.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/world/19Mcqueen1/19Mcqueen1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
We Are The Mighty,"A Vietnamese soldier keeps watch in front of U.S. aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson after its arrival at a port in Danang, Vietnam March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Nguyen Huy Kham The USS Carl Vinson has arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam — the first visit by an American warship since 1975. The move is meant to send a message to China, but Russia might be the real loser as US forces will get a close look at a number of Vietnam's Russian-made warships. In what is the first visit to Vietnam by an American warship since 1975, the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) has arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam for a port visit. The last time American carriers visited Vietnam was during Operation Frequent Wind, an evacuation from Saigon before communist North Vietnamese forces conquered the south. According to a United States Navy release, the carrier was joined by the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain (CG 57) and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG 108). While the public story is about how this visit, announced in January by Secretary of Defense James Mattis, reflects the United States and the Hanoi governments putting aside the bitterness of the Vietnam War, the obvious, underlying story here is about sending a message to Communist China. During Operation Frequent Wind, American naval vessels served as a landing point for many South Vietnamese who were seeking to escape the communists. Numerous planes and helicopters were landed on American carriers and, in many cases, pushed over the side to make room for more escapees. U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, USS Carl Vinson, docks at a port in Danang, Vietnam March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Nguyen Huy Kham Those who ran had good reason: The communist regime was responsible for executing at least 65,000 people and sending over 400,000 others to 're-education' camps. Today, there still exists a great deal of repression and local populations, like the Montagnard tribes, have been targeted for genocide by the government. Meanwhile, the South China Sea has been a major maritime flashpoint, with Communist China having buzzed American planes multiple times in 2017. Before the fall of South Vietnam, the Chinese Communists took the Paracel Islands in a 1974 naval battle. The visit by USS Carl Vinson is a way of sending China a message — but Russia might emerge as the real loser in this exchange. Vietnam has acquired a number of modern Russian ships, including Gepard-class frigates and Tarantul V-class missile corvettes. Vietnam has also acquired two shore-launched batteries of SS-N-26 Sapless anti-ship missiles. The Vietnamese People's Air Force also has 46 Su-27/30 Flankers either in hand or on order. All of these Russian systems will be looked at closely as the United States and Vietnam grow closer, giving the U.S. valuable insight into the rival peer's technology.","REUTERS/Nguyen Huy Kham The USS Carl Vinson has arrived in Da Nang, Vietnam — the first visit by an American warship since 1975.

Danny Crichton,"Patreon announced today that it was creating multiple pricing tiers for its membership service, with varying levels of features offered depending on price. The company will now offer a Lite offering that charges a 5% commission, a Pro offering at 8%, and a Premium option at 12%, with discounted rates for existing founders.
Todays announcement is in line with the telegraphs we heard from the company in the deep dive TechCrunch conducted a few weeks ago as part of our first EC-1 package on Extra Crunch. As TechCrunch media columnist Eric Peckham discussed at the time in regards to Patreons fee structure and overall business model:
The problem is, its too friendly. [Patreon CEO Jack] Conte admits that Patreons current fee structure isnt lucrative enough for it to operate profitably as a business: Its not enough. Weve got to figure something else out. This low fee rate comparable more to a payment processor like Stripe than other platforms for creators and fans was the main critique from VCs I talked with as well (both those who invested in the company and those who did not). 
Patreon therefore needs additional revenue streams, and, unsurprisingly, it is already developing them. The company is preparing to offer additional functionality to creators in exchange for a higher cut of their revenue. Conte talks about this as a value for value plan 
While the new fee structure (5%/8%/12%) was expected from Patreon, the scale of the fees are surprisingly low given the messaging Peckham heard at the time. The companys competitors charge significantly more as much as 30% and that leaves a large gap between the startup and the rest of the market.
That said, a huge part of Peckhams thesis and given the new fees, perhaps Patreons as well is that membership is just a stepping stone to other services that will be far more lucrative than just a scrape on transactions. As Peckham wrote:
If membership gains mainstream traction among mid-tail creators and if Patreon (both through its Patreon platform and Memberful subsidiary) secures dominant market share as this market expands, it will be in a powerful position to offer ancillary services that could be quite lucrative. As Jack Conte told me, Membership is Patreons Act 1. Theres so much more we can do to fund the creative class. Youre gonna need more than just membership. Over the next 10 years, theres going to be a lot more that we do.
Peckham noted financial services such as loans, as well as options like health insurance as potentially large categories of value-added services that could make the miserly revenue scrape much more bearable for the company long-term.
Given the importance of Patreon to the creative economy, be sure to read all of Peckhams reports on the companys founding story, product, business, investment thesis, competition, and exit options.","Patreon announced today that it was creating multiple pricing tiers for its membership service, with varying levels of features offered depending on price.

"Steve Garrison steve.garrison@nwi.com, 219-853-2563","CROWN POINT — A man faces charges after his toddler daughter shot her pregnant mother with his gun Tuesday outside Plato's Closet in Merrillville, court documents state. Menzo M. Brazier, 21, of Michigan City, was charged Thursday in Lake Criminal Court with two counts each of criminal recklessness and neglect of a dependent. Police were dispatched about 3:38 p.m. Tuesday to Plato's Closet, 359 E. 81st Ave., for reports of a gunshot wound. Officers found Brazier at the store holding a blood-soaked towel against his pregnant girlfriend's chest, according to court records. The woman had a gunshot wound that entered the upper right side of her back and exited near her collar bone. The woman was transported to Methodist Hospitals Southlake Campus and then Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois, where she was treated in their intensive care unit, records state. She told police in a statement her 3-year-old daughter accidentally shot her with her boyfriend's gun. The father told police his girlfriend was sitting in their vehicle with their children, ages 3 and 1, while he was shopping for pants inside Plato's Closet. He said he did not want to bring his loaded 9 mm handgun into the store, so he put it between the front passenger seat and center compartment. He said he was inside shopping when someone entered the store and said a woman outside was bleeding. He went outside and found his wounded wife leaning against the side of their car. Brazier allegedly admitted the gun was loaded, but claimed a bullet was not chambered. He said he told his daughter not to touch his guns or knives, records state. Brazier was wanted by police on a warrant for failure to appear in Porter County Superior Court on traffic violations, records state. The defendant was arrested on the warrant. He remains held without bond at Lake County Jail, records state.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Sarah Gray), Sarah Gray","An elementary school in Virginia apologized after facing criticism from parents and the Loudoun NAACP chapter over an aspect of its Black History Month curriculum. 
 Madison's Trust Elementary School students in grades 3 through 5 were taught about the Underground Railroad in gym class through a ""game"" where kids, including African-American students, had to go through an obstacle course, according to a local NBC News affiliate WRC-TV. 
 Wayde Byard a Loudoun County Public School spokesperson told the Loudoun Times-Mirror that students were not assigned roles as ""slaves"" or ""slave owners"" for the game. However, some parents felt that because the concept of the activity was to avoid obstacles, as if escaping slavery through the Underground Railroad, students were assuming the role of runaway slaves, the Times-Mirror said. INSIDER contacted the school system for more information.

Sidney Fussell,"For the first time ever, two AI systems built to process and respond to human speech (created, respectively, by Microsoft and Chinese commerce giant Alibaba) outscored humans in a reading comprehension test designed by Stanford researchers. The Stanford Question Answering Dataset, SQuAD, is composed of a staggering 100,000 questions following brief reading passages. Created in 2016, SQuAD is used as a benchmark to measure AI’s progress in natural language processing. After reading excerpts from Wikipedia, the systems answer questions like “What is the Latin name for Black Death?” and “How many actors have played Doctor Who?” Both Microsoft and Alibaba’s AI outscored humanity in the latest round of testing. Alibaba’s AI score was 82.44, and Microsoft’s was 82.650, with humans trailing behind them both at 82.304. Alibaba’s system may have finished second, but it’s more than qualified to handle its day job: working in sales. The company’s AI team reportedly works closely with the developers of Ali Xiaomi, a chat bot that answers customer questions about products. At peak times, Alibaba says 95 percent of its online customer questions can be handled by Ali Xiaomi. For now, the goal is creating a new class of responsive AI to help with a variety of online tasks. Similarly, Microsoft has used AI to boost the capabilities of its office suite. “The technology underneath can be gradually applied to numerous applications,” said Alibaba’s chief scientist Luo Si in a statement, “such as customer service, museum tutorials and online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the need for human input in an unprecedented way.” There’s something grimly familiar about an exceedingly well-trained AI trapped in a 9 to 5 answering sales questions, but while the scores are certainly impressive, AI is far from comprehending things as we understand the concept. As MIT Technology Review’s Jamie Condliffe puts its, AI can only recognize answers in terms of patterns or structures. So while it can correctly answer “Who was elected President in November 1960?” it doesn’t actually know who “John F. Kennedy” is.

Adam Clark Estes,"If the term “smart sound bar” seems unusual, that’s because it’s brand new. TCL just announced the first in a new class of gadgets that act a little bit like a smart speaker and a little bit like a remote control that’s powered by your voice. As the name implies, the new TCL Roku Smart Sound Bar is powered by the newly announced Roku Entertainment Assistant. Suddenly, everybody’s favorite set-top box company does a lot more than make set-top boxes. This all might sound a little bit confusing, so let’s dive right into what TCL’s new smart sound bar actually does. The Roku Entertainment Assistant is a voice-controlled assistant that’s a lot like Alexa, but its functionality is focused on controlling devices like TVs, speakers, and, of course, sound bars. This means that you can tell the TCL Roku Smart Sound Bar to turn on the TV and on the TV will turn, regardless of what kind of TV you have. You can also use the Roku Entertainment Assistant to search for content and play music on the sound bar, even if the TV is turned off. If you happened to have a TV powered by Roku OS, the Smart Sound Bar will give you even more control over your devices. Roku announced its new Entertainment Assistant alongside a new licensing program called Roku Connect. This feature sounds a bit like Airplay, because devices enabled with Roku Connect or powered by Roku OS can easily talk to each other over the air. For now, the TCL Roku Smart Sound Bar is the only device with Roku Connect, but you could easily see how other speakers and TVs will adopt the new standard. Aside from the Roku Entertainment Features, TCL hasn’t offered much more information about the new Smart Sound Bar. The device will ship in late 2018 as the first member of the new Alto family of TCL products. Additionally, TCL is launching two all-new lines of 4K TVs powered by Roku OS: the 6-Series and the 5-Series. Both series include top notch specs like Dolby Vision HDR and Wide Color Gamut, while the 6-Series sets itself apart by offer up to 120 Contrast Control Zones. The new TVs will be available this spring. Pricing has not yet been announced on any of the new TCL products.","If the term “smart sound bar” seems unusual, that’s because it’s brand new.

Bryan Menegus,"A lawsuit filed in August of 2014 on behalf of California Uber drivers is finally paying out, and recipients of the $7.75 million settlement are finding their share leaves something to be desired. Back in August of 2014, a driver named Steven Price sued Uber for damages resulting from alleged labor misclassification, including failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, missed meal periods and rest periods, and unlawful business practices. In short, Price claimed Uber drivers were employees the company was treating as contractors, a scheme that has become a staple of the gig economy, most visibly affecting rideshare drivers, last-mile package couriers, and those engaged in food delivery or personal shopping. That suit was settled in late January of this year, and payments were scheduled to arrive on or before last Friday. That $7.75 million was split among “any and all Drivers who consented to a background check as part of the sign-up process to use the Uber software application and/or used the Uber software application to generate leads in California at anytime from July 8,2013 up to and including January 29, 2017,” according to the settlement. But after plaintiffs’ attorney fees, administration costs, and allocations to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, the amount apportioned to drivers was less than $1 million. Even though the time period covered by the suit represents three and a half years, a number of drivers posting on Reddit and other ridershare driver forums describe payments of less than $20 —some drastically so. Three drivers sent Gizmodo copies of the notices they received. One was awarded $7.05. Another, 75 cents. The third was given just 15 cents. Though we were unable to verify settlement amounts beyond these three claims before publication, other posts suggest $3 to $5 was average. This is partly a result of the structure of California’s Private Attorneys General Act—a law for employee recovery of civil penalties in labor violations—and with class-action suits in general. But these meager payouts also read as an insult following the uproar around a recent study that found around half of rideshare drivers made below minimum wage. We’ve reached out to Uber for comment and will update when we hear back.","A lawsuit filed in August of 2014 on behalf of California Uber drivers is finally paying out, and recipients of the $7.75 million settlement are finding their share leaves something to be desired.

Comedian Alyssa Limperis recently posted her impression of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to YouTube and Twitter on Thursday. Limperis imagines how Ocasio-Cortez might respond to Tan France, the stylist from Queer Eye, and his infamous French tuck (France's preferred method of tucking shirts).
The cast of Queer Eye, sans Karamo Brown, recently visited Ocasio-Cortez and other Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill.

The impression is terrifyingly spot-on. Limperis captures Ocasio-Cortez's emphatic way of announcing her syllables and characteristic hand movements. She knows exactly where she places her gaze and just how often she twists her neck in a mini-fit of irritation.
Kudos to Limperis for further addressing one of the show's greatest injustices the excessive amount of labor Bobby Berk performs compared to others on the show.

KATIE ROGERS,"Federal employees are counting on getting back their lost pay at some point, but contracted workers could face a different outcome. A spokeswoman for the General Services Administration said that facility managers considered federal employees and many contracted janitors and maintenance workers in some offices are still working, but was not able to say whether the contractors would eventually receive their pay.
If they are contractors, said Amanda Osborn, a spokesman for the agency, their pay is determined by the status of their contract.
Besides the issue of paying workers, other practical matters at the White House have been left unattended for now.
Days after the shutdown took hold, representatives from the Treasury Department left notice with DC Water, the Washington water utility, that the federal governments $16.5 million quarterly water bill would not be fully paid, leading to a lively discussion among the DC Water Board about at what point a clients water could be cut off, according to a report from the news website WAMU.
It turns out the board will let this one slide.
We are not turning off water to the White House, Vincent Morris, a DC Water spokesman, said in an email. The administration has an outstanding tab of about $5 million.
Lengthy shutdowns can be disastrous for the White House for other reasons.
The last time a shutdown went on for this long, President Bill Clinton put himself on the long road to impeachment when he courted a young intern named Monica Lewinsky in an empty corner of the West Wing. Nonessential employees had been sent home, unpaid interns were brought in to work, and the rest is bitter history.
The Obama administration barred interns from coming to work during a shutdown, and the Trump White Houses new class of interns has not yet started, according to a senior official.","The pain of the partial government shutdown bit into all corners of America — even the White House, where there is often very little sympathy for those whose job it is to keep Washington running.",2019-01-11T01:48:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","White House Memo: At White House, Empty Desks and Unpaid Bills as Trump Shows No Sign of Relenting",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/white-house-government-shutdown.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/us/politics/11dc-memo-print/merlin_148993488_e1744daa-0b1d-4432-bcbe-ab1755f30b29-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
EMILY S. RUEB,"Although Mr. Beierle had searched online for pornographic yoga content as well as locations and schedules of yoga studios in Tallahassee, the department concluded that there was no evidence he had specifically targeted any individual.
But Mr. DeLeo said it was likely that Mr. Beierle targeted a familiar community in Tallahassee, where records show he had been arrested at least twice, including separate cases in 2012 and 2016 in which he was accused of groping a woman. Both of those cases were dismissed.
The department also obtained communications from 2013 between Mr. Beierle and a woman named Jennifer whom he had met online and who mentioned that she had attended a hot yoga class in Tallahassee. The relationship soured after Mr. Beierle sent her sexually suggestive messages, according to the police.
Chief DeLeo said Mr. Beierle suffered severe financial stress because he had been fired at least twice from substitute teaching jobs and sought mental health counseling on a number of occasions. Chief DeLeo said that records could not be released because of privacy laws.

"Tal Kopan, CNN","Washington (CNN) The Trump administration has reunited at least 450 families separated at the border with children 5 and older, including almost 100 just overnight. But there are still roughly 1,900 who need to be reunified or ruled ineligible by next Thursday, and a government attorney warned ""some complicated issues"" will pop up in the coming week. Still, at a court hearing Friday afternoon, the judge who last month ordered the government to put back together the families it had separated at the border said he was very pleased with how things are going. ""I am just very impressed with the effort that is being made,"" US District Judge Dana Sabraw told the attorneys in the case. ""It really does appear that there's been great progress and that -- at least for those class members who are eligible and easy, relatively speaking, to reunify, and that's a very significant number of the group -- that that is happening, and it's very promising."" After the Trump administration's widely criticized ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy that resulted in thousands of family separations at the border, Sabraw ordered the government to reunite families it had separated, including those from before that official policy. Some of the parents and children have spent months apart, shuffled to facilities all over the country. Communication has been difficult for many, with some parents of even young speaking to their kids only a handful of times at best. But the pace of reunions has ramped up substantially this week, as officials scramble to meet the judge's deadline. Justice Department attorney August Flentje told the judge that even since an update filed Thursday evening, another almost 100 children had been reunited with their parents. As of 7 a.m. ET Friday, there had been 450 reunifications. That was in addition to the at least 58 children under 5 who were reunited in the first stage of the court's order. But there are 2,551 children 5 and older in government custody likely to have been separated from their parents at the border who must be reunified by next Thursday's deadline, if they are found eligible. According to the latest government numbers, that leaves almost 1,900 who are still awaiting reunion or eligibility determinations. Close to 250 parents have already been ruled out -- most because they declined reunification and the rest because of criminal records or other concerns. The pace of reunifications could continue to be rapid. In court Friday, Flentje said nearly 1,000 parents had been already cleared to be reunited. But hundreds of the remaining parents could have already been deported, as well. The government has yet to provide a figure for how many were sent back to their home countries without their children. On Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said administration officials told him it was at least 180. There are still 37 kids whose parents are unknown entirely. ""There's a lot of work left to do,"" Flentje said, adding that the Health and Human Services Department official leading the effort ""is working hard to get this done."" ""I think there are going to be some complicated issues that arise in this next week, especially in some of these areas that are harder to track down the parents,"" he added.","The Trump administration has reunited at least 450 families separated at the border with children 5 and older, including almost 100 just overnight.",2018-07-20T23:04:27Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Family reunifications: 450 down, roughly 1,900 to go by Thursday",https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/politics/family-reunification-pace/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180614143936-family-separation-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-5,1
Brian Heater,"On September 5, Senator Bernie Sanders will introduce legislation aimed at curbing large companies like Amazon and Walmart’s “corporate welfare.” Amazon has unsurprisingly been on the offensive since the Vermont Senator called the company out by name. When we interviewed Sanders by phone yesterday, the retail giant provided us with a fairly standard comment, “encourage[ing] anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers.” Today, however, it’s got something more substantial, and the company’s not mincing words here. In a blog post titled “Response to Senator Sanders,” Amazon calls out what it claims are “inaccurate and misleading accusations” against the company. Sanders noted in our conversation that Amazon has been less than forthcoming with certain details, though the company says its been “in regular contact” with his office. Yesterday a Sanders representative confirmed with TechCrunch by email that Amazon had offered the senator a tour of a fulfillment center. It was an offer Sanders planned to take the company up on, though no date has been set. “While Senator Sanders plays politics and makes misleading accusations, we are expending real money and effort upskilling people with our Career Choice program,” the company writes. “Career Choice is an innovative benefit that pre-pays 95 percent of tuition, fees and textbooks (up to $12,000) for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether they’re related to skills for jobs at Amazon or not. We have over 16,000 employees who have participated in Career Choice.”. @sensanders would like to understand your experience at AMZN.He only asks if you are on SNAP (he calls it “food stamps”), but I hope he’d be interested in hearing that you’re not.Please tell him your truth. I encourage you all to share your experiences: https://t.co/aRJ1kZBh5H. — Dave Clark (@davehclark) August 29, 2018 Of course, the senator is hardly the first to levy such complaints against the company, as we noted yesterday. A recent story from Business Insider documents what it deems “horror stories” from inside some of the company’s warehouses. It’s a suggestion billionaire owner Jeff Bezos has roundly refuted, stating, “I am very proud of our working conditions, and I am very proud of the wages that we pay.” Bezos, in particular, has received the brunt of Sanders’ criticism. The senator made income inequality a tentpole issue of his 2016 presidential campaign, and the focus has carried over to companies like Amazon. As has been noted, the median salary at the company is $28,444, less than Bezos makes every ten seconds. Sanders’ bill is aimed at what he has deemed the corporate welfare of companies like Amazon and Walmart. “It says: if you are a large company of 500 or more employees and you’re paying your workers wages that are so low that they have to go on food stamps, Medicaid, public housing, etc., then you have to pay taxes commensurate to how much the government is now spending for that assistance,” Sanders told TechCrunch. “It’s going to be the employer – the Jeff Bezos, the Walton family – who will pick up the tab for these public assistance programs, rather than the middle class of the country.” Amazon’s response takes specific issue with Sanders’ use of “food stamps” in his complaints against the company “In the U.S., the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15/hour before overtime,” Amazon writes. “We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers. Senator Sanders’ references to SNAP, which hasn’t been called “food stamps” for several years, are also misleading because they include people who only worked for Amazon for a short period of time and/or chose to work part-time — both of these groups would almost certainly qualify for SNAP.”","On September 5, Senator Bernie Sanders will introduce legislation aimed at curbing large companies like Amazon and Walmart’s “corporate welfare.” Amazon has unsurprisingly been on the offensive since the Vermont Senator called the company out by name.

Rita Liao,"BMW has joined a handful of automakers to compete with transportation upstart Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s Chinese business in 2016. Last Friday, the German luxury carmaker launched a premium ride-hailing service in Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan Province with over 14 million people. The new offer is part of BMW’s ReachNow carsharing brand that kicked off an electric vehicle rental business with a local partner last December. The new ride-hailing venture manages a crew of trained drivers to chauffer riders in a fleet of 200 BMW 5 Series, out of which half are plug-in-hybrid, according to the company. We are excited to offer our new premium ride-hailing service in Chengdu, one of the largest ride-hailing hubs in the world embracing mobility solutions for a sustainable urban future,” said Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of BMW AG’s board of management, in a statement. ReachNow trips appear to be pricier than those on Didi’s “luxury” feature — which is currently only available in China’s top-tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou — that also deploys BMW Series 5 and the likes of Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6. A 23-kilometer ride in Chengdu, for instance, costs 468 yuan or $68 at 3 p.m. on Monday. That’s about $3 per kilometer. By comparison, a trip of similar distance in Shenzhen via Didi Luxury costs 210 yuan, or $30, at a rate of $1.3 per kilometer on a Monday afternoon. BMW’s new move comes shortly after it became the first global carmaker to nab China’s ride-hailing operating license in late November and at a time when the country’s biggest player Didi faces public and government backlashes following two passenger murders. Following the Didi incidents, Chinese authorities have applied deeper controls over the verification process in both drivers and their vehicles to step up safety for riders, leading to a shortage in both drivers and vehicles for Didi and its ride-hailing peers. China’s transportation rules stipulate that drivers must hold two certificates — one for themselves and one for their vehicles — to be eligible to take passenger requests on ride-hailing apps. That turned a lot of part-time drivers away as they either don’t want to invest the time and money preparing for exams or scrap their passenger cars after eight years. To cope with regulatory changes, Didi has introduced training programs to help drivers obtain the desired licenses. The mobility giant has also partnered with carmakers to make “purpose-built” vehicles for on-demand rides, although that process had started before the passenger deaths. Like BMW, China’s oldfashioned carmakers also have their sights set on the car-hailing market. Among them are Volkswagen’s local partner SAIC Motor and Geely, which is partnering with Daimler to roll out a new ride-hailing venture.","BMW has joined a handful of automakers to compete with transportation upstart Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber’s Chinese business in 2016.

Andrew Liptak,"This morning, Trump once again tweeted about online retailer Amazon.com, alleging that it is scamming the United States Postal Service and that the agency should raise its shipping rates. He also says that The Washington Post — owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos — should register as a lobbyist. Earlier this week, Axios reported that President Donald Trump wanted to take on Amazon. The President followed up with a tweet on March 29th, saying that Amazon was taking advantage of the USPS, paying little in state and local taxes, and putting retailers out of business. The New York Times outlined earlier this week that Amazon has collected sales taxes since April 2017. The retailer reported $957 million in income taxes last year. The Times also lays out that while the USPS is losing money — it reported losses of $2.7 billion in 2017 — these losses are due in part to declining volumes of “marketing and first-class mail,” and the agency’s requirement to prefund the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund each year, which costs over $5 billion annually. Indeed, the growth in package shipping from retailers like Amazon have been beneficial to the agency, which “have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.” The Washington Post reports that officials have explained to the President that Amazon’s contracts with the USPS are profitable. While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018 In his second tweet, the president says that the retailer is taking advantage of the USPS, saying that Amazon is scamming the agency. He cites a Citi Bank report (via the Times ) which says that the agency’s rates are underpriced, and that price adjustments could bring in additional revenue of $2.6 billion each year. The Times notes that while Amazon does have a shipping arrangement with the USPS, the agency has reviewed the rates and found them to be profitable, and has said that said rates are competitive in the marketplace. The Post cites officials who say that Trump’s anger towards Amazon is a result of the paper’s coverage of his administration, and claims that it is acting as a lobbyist on behalf of Bezos. The Post says that while it is owned by the Amazon CEO, it operates independently of the retailer.

Shana Lebowitz,"Japan is facing a fertility crisis — and these efforts could help. Carl Court/Getty The Atlantic recently reported on Ikumen classes in Japan, or classes that teach men how to be better fathers. The catch? At least in the session that Atlantic reporter Stephen Marche attended, none of the men in the class were dads or expecting dads. Some weren't even dating anyone. The idea is at least partly to impress women with the fact that they have some fatherhood experience. Men in the class practice bathing fake infants and wear weight suits to simulate a woman's pregnant body — but they also learn other ways of being better husbands and fathers. The teacher in Marche's class recommended that the men compliment their wives (and potential future wives) with comments like: ""This is delicious"" or ""Your outfit looks cute today!"" Those are suggested as alternatives to comments like, ""Why did you sleep in so late?"" A more public spectacle of wife-appreciation is Japan's annual ""Beloved Wives Day,"" in which men stand up in public and shout into a microphone how much they adore their wives. Beloved Wives Day, which has been celebrated in January for about a decade now, is the brainchild of Kiyo Yamana, the founder of the Japan Aisaika Organization. (""Aisaika"" means ""adoring husband."") JAO's ""5 Golden Rules of Devoted Husbands"" are: 1. Go home early, before 8 p.m. 2. Create a relaxing atmosphere 3. Call your wife by her name 4. Look into her eyes 5. Listen to what she has to say As Kiyo's wife, Kimi, told Christiane Amanpour in the CNN series ""Sex and Love Around the World,"" she and Kiyo have abided by these rules since they got married — and they explain why the couple are so happy. Ikumen classes and Beloved Wives Day come at a time when Japan is facing a fertility crisis — or what economists call a ""demographic time bomb."" The Atlantic previously reported that a lack of job opportunities for men could be to blame. Japanese men are still expected to support their families, and both men and women may be reluctant to marry and have children if they know it will be financially difficult. And as Business Insider has previously reported, work in Japan can be so demanding that young people often have no time to date or to start a family. Meanwhile, JAO suspects that the Aisaika lifestyle could be an ""unknown traditional culture of Japan."" The JAO website also reads: ""The Aisaika group has been initiated by middle-aged men who had come to think that good and sustainable marital relationship may very well lead to the world peace and preservation of the global environment.""","Japan has begun offering classes and celebrating holidays that encourage men to appreciate their wives.

Sam Rutherford,"At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs. But among Acer’s avalanche of metal and silicon, there was one device that felt like an anchor for the company’s growth and success: the new Chromebook Spin 13. For years, Acer has made some of the best Chromebooks you could buy, and with the new 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 13, Acer is keeping the newfound flexibility found on last year’s R13, while upping the ante with a new an all new, more premium feeling design. 1 / 5 Taking a cue from the Google Pixelbook, the Chromebook Spin 13 features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of a traditional 16:9 ldisplay. Then, Acer went and replaced the big long hinge on the R13 with a more standard two-sided setup, before tacking on a new one-piece Gorilla Glass touchpad. And unlike Acer Chromebooks of old couple years ago, the Spin 13 sports a full metal chassis that should give it some added durability and a touch of class. The Chromebook Spin 13 shouldn’t be hurting on power either thanks to your choice of 8th-gen Intel Core i3 or i5 CPUs, up to 16GB of RAM, and either 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of storage. The Spin 13 even features built-in Wacom stylus support (including an onboard hidey hold for stashing the active pen when its not in use), so you can save handwritten notes or sketches with ease. But perhaps the best thing about the Chromebook Spin 13 is that it looks like its going to cost half the price of Google’s slick, but expensive $1,000 Pixelbook. Prices are going to start at $400 for a non-2-in-1 Chromebook 13, while the the 13 Spin will command a $100 premium on top of that. And just in case you wanted something slightly bigger, Acer is also making 15-inch versions of its new Chromebook, including the new $450 Chromebook Spin 15, which Acer claims is the world’s first 15-inch Chrome OS convertible.","At Acer’s annual global press conference today, the company announced its usual assortment of new computers ranging from humble tablets built for education to the wild desktop rigs with dual Xeon CPUs.

Jack Stewart,"Nearly a week after Elon Musk sent the markets and the media into a tizzy by tweeting he wants to take Tesla private, there's some more information about how he'd do it, and what it would mean for the company. Just in case you're not a follower of Tesla Twitter, here’s a quick recap of the privatization drama. On Tuesday, Musk tweeted “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” The abruptness of the announcement and the particular number Musk suggested (420 is a well known marijuana reference) had people asking if it was a joke or if the CEO's account had been hacked. Twitter seemed an extraordinary way to make such a momentous announcement, even if Musk aggressively uses the platform. But later that day, the official Tesla Twitter account posted a memo Musk sent to employees explaining why he thinks going private is a good idea. Then, on Wednesday, the Tesla board of directors released a short statement saying that Musk brought up the idea of taking the company private last week, and they are evaluating it. It's no secret Musk hates being beholden to quarterly targets, short sellers, and the reporting requirements that come with being a publicly-traded company. But going private isn't as easy as sending a tweet. There are all sorts of questions about the mechanics, logistics, and legalities of such a move. The biggest outstanding issue is where the funding will come from. If Musk plans to pay out $420 per share, that values the company at something like $71 billion. That's a lot of money, and there are a limited number of supremely wealthy investors who can back this kind of venture. Three frontrunners would be investors out of Japan, Saudi Arabia, and China. Musk reportedly had discussions in 2017 with Japan’s SoftBank, which has a huge $100 billion fund to invest in technology companies, though talks reportedly ended when Musk demanded too much control. Saudi Arabia has billions in sovereign money that it invests through its Public Investment Fund, with the goal of helping the oil-dependent country diversify. Electric cars would seem the perfect hedge against consumers turning away from the internal combustion engine, and as The Financial Times reported on Tuesday, a little before Musk's tweet, the fund already bought a just-under 5 percent stake in the company. But China is the most likely source for the money, according to Michael Dunne, CEO of ZoZo Go, an investment advisory company for the automotive industry. He says the massive luxury car market there, a government-determined to transition to EVs, and customers who’ll pay a premium for an exclusive brand, all make China the most important market for electric cars, and one that’s only going to grow. The government is mandating 10 percent of all sales next year are battery powered. That means Chinese investors are desperately looking to buy their way in. China’s internet giant, Tencent, already holds about 5 percent of Tesla stock. “If you look at China’s EV sector, and how much money has poured into startups born in the last few years, from Byton to Neo, it’s billions of dollars easily,” says Dunne. And that’s for companies that haven’t built a car, and have no track record. Tesla might be a new player in the automotive world, but it's a surer bet compared to some of its competitors. Musk may have persuaded just one, very wealthy, funding source to back his vision, or he may have pieced together a deal from several investors. If reports of his negotiations with Softbank are accurate, he wants to retain the leadership role he currently has so Tesla can continue on the path he’s put it on. What does this mean for current or wannabe Tesla owners? Nothing. No changes. If anything, Musk believes he’ll deliver the lower-priced sedan, and future vehicles like the teased Model Y small SUV, sooner and more easily. But the biggest question remains: what are the legal issues at play here? The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Musk’s shock tweet was an attempt to manipulate the stock price, but the best defense is always the truth. As long as Musk really does have financing in place and wasn’t exaggerating, he’s probably okay. As for using Twitter for financial announcements, Musk may be able to fall back on the so-called Reed Hastings Rule. Hastings, the Netflix CEO, boasted about company performance on Facebook in 2012, instead of using conventional, formal, investor communications. The SEC ruled he didn’t do anything wrong, saying social media is fair game as long as investors are aware that's how key company data might be published. All that said: Reuters reported late Friday that a Tesla stockholder filed a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Musk meant his tweet to ""completely decimate"" Tesla short sellers. Expect more legal drama before this episode ends. Ultimately, any deal has to be approved by shareholders in a future vote. And investors are going to want more information before making a decision that large. So at some point, Musk is going to be forced into revealing his hand, even if he doles it out 280 characters at a time.

Kate Clark,"After selling their ridesharing startup, 99, to Didi Chuxing for $1 billion last year, Ariel Lambrecht and Renato Freitas didn’t waste any time throwing their hats back in the ring. Months after their big exit, the pair joined forces with Eduardo Musa, who spent two decades in the bicycle industry, to start another S ã o Paulo-based mobility startup. Yellow, a bike- and scooter-sharing service, quickly captured the attention of venture capitalists, raising a $9 million seed round in April and now, the company is announcing the close of a $63 million Series A. The round is the largest Series A financing ever for a startup in Latin America, where tech investment, especially from U.S.-based firms, has historically remained low. 2017, however, was a banner year for Latin American startups; 2018, it seems, is following suit. More than $600 million was invested in the first quarter of 2018, partly as a result of increased activity from international investors. And just last month, on-demand delivery startup Rappi brought in $200 million to become the second Latin American company to garner a billion-dollar valuation. GGV Capital has led the round for Yellow. The Silicon Valley firm is a backer of several other mobility companies, including Grab, Hellobike and Didi Chuxing. Yellow represents the firm’s first foray into the Latin American tech ecosystem. Brazilian VC firm M onashees, Grishin Robotics, Base10 Partners and Class 5 also participated. “We think there’s a new economy emerging in Latin America,” GGV managing partner Hans Tung told TechCrunch. “A lot of people are more cautious but what we’ve seen with our experience in China, when internet penetration started to happen, a new economy started to emerge that’s more efficient.” Yellow’s bikes and e-scooters are only available in São Paulo. With the investment, the startup plans to expand to Mexico City, Colombia, Chile and Argentina, as well as add e-bikes to its portfolio of micro-mobility options. The company also plans to tap into local resources by building a scooter manufacturing facility in the region. Yellow CEO Eduardo Musa told me the company doesn’t want to be reliant on Chinese manufacturers to import scooters and that a local supplier is a whole lot cheaper. The company’s bikes are already sourced locally. “Since the beginning, we wanted to be vertically integrated,” Musa told TechCrunch. “We definitely believe you need a constant inflow of hardware and you need control and management over the supply chain … not only because of the cost but also because of the quality control.” Yellow is one of several e-scooter startups to raise VC in 2018. Bird and Lime, for example, both raised large rounds of capital at billion-dollar valuations. A good chunk of that capital has gone into building more scooters, placing a huge demand on the few Chinese manufacturers that’ve tapped into the market. “There was simply not available capacity or factories prepared to fulfill the demand that arose from the other scooter sharing companies,” Musa said. “This became, very, very quickly, a major bottleneck for this industry.”","After selling their ridesharing startup, 99, to Didi Chuxing for $1 billion last year, Ariel Lambrecht and Renato Freitas didn’t waste any time throwing their hats back in the ring.

David Schmalz,"Editor's Note: Updates to this story are below the original post. At approximately 1:20pm March 13 at Seaside High, Dennis Alexander, a math and administration of justice teacher who is also a Seaside city councilman and a reserve officer for Sand City Police Department, accidentally discharged his firearm during a gun safety demonstration. According to a statement from Seaside Police, no one was seriously injured in the incident, although Seaside Police Chief Abdul Pridgen says a male student was struck in the neck by ""debris or fragmentation"" from something overhead, and was transported to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula for treatment. He emphasizes that it was not a bullet, and was ""not life threatening."" UPDATE 4:05pm: Monterey Peninsula Unified School District sent out the following statement today to the parents of students in the classroom: ""We want to make you aware of an accident that occurred in the Administration of Justice class today at Seaside High School. As some of you may know, the teacher is a reserve police officer. Today, during class, the teacher accidentally discharged his firearm during a lesson while it was pointed at the ceiling. Debris from the ceiling then fell. Upon learning of the incident, our Human Resources department, school site administration and the Seaside Police Department immediately began investigating the incident, including interviewing students in the class. In discussion with your student, if he/she has information to share that has not already been shared, please direct the student to me. We will also have counseling services available for students. Due to the nature of this personnel incident, we are unable to share any other details. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the on-going investigation. The safety of your student is always our top priority, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our efforts to keep them safe while they are under our care."" UPDATE 5pm: Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante says that Alexander had his last gun safety training ""a little less than a year ago."" He says his department will do an administrative investigation of the incident once Seaside PD completes its investigation. Ferrante adds that Alexander has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of his department's investigation, which will determine if any of the department's policies regarding the safe handling of firearms were violated. UPDATE 5:30pm: MPUSD superintendent PK Diffenbaugh confirms that incident took place during an administration of justice class, a career pathway class that is unique to Seaside High in the school district. He adds that, "" Clearly, we will revisit this incident to ensure that something like this would never happen again."" The administration of justice class has been offered at Seaside High at least since Diffenbaugh came to the district in June 2014, though he adds it has since been expanded to two classes—administration of justice 1 and 2—due to student demand. UPDATE 6:45pm: Diffenbaugh, in a follow up conversation, says it's against state law and district board policy to have a non-authorized individual carry a firearm on campus, and that Alexander was not authorized by the school district to have one. ""We'll need to revisit protocol to make sure all staff members understand that is the policy,"" Diffenbaugh says.

Adam Rosenberg,"There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news. Bungie dusted off and updated a fresh batch exotic gear from the first Destiny, and will be adding it all to the Destiny 2 loot pool with the release of the May 8 expansion. In all, there are seven returning exotics that we know of. SEE ALSO: 'Destiny 2' gets Warmind and a major update this week. Here's the deal. Because I'm a monster, I decided to rank them. It's mostly armor, so your own ranking is probably super different, and entirely dependent on which class you prefer to play. Personally, I think Warlocks are a trash character class with a trash jump, and you'll see that reflected here. All of which is to say: Please enjoy my 100 percent scientific, completely official, and impossible to argue ranking of Warmind 's returning Destiny exotics. (Note: This ranking assumes all of this returning gear works just like it did in the original Destiny. I might re-rank them after Warmind is out and all secrets are revealed. But this is really just for fun, folks. Don't have a cow.) 7. Suros Regime Image: bungie Look. Any serious Destiny fan knows that Suros is actually #1 here. It's the only weapon in this lineup, for one. But more than that: It's freaking Suros Regime. One of the best weapons in the original game. Not only can it heal you as it deals damage, the bottom half of its magazine also deals bonus damage. For some Destiny players, this is the only exotic they ever used. Suros gets the bottom-rung nod mostly because it's the only weapon here, and it's always fun to start these dumb lists with a curveball. Or hey, let's say it's because the gun is blue now. Sure. That works. Suros is blue and that's bad. 6. Claws of Ahamkara Image: bungie As we've already discussed, Warlocks are trash. They're better in Destiny 2, sure, but their jump still sucks. The Claws of Ahamkara are a Warlock exotic, so instant demerit there. They also come with a fairly useless ability, which is a real problem for a class of gear that's supposed to make you feel powerful. Equip the Claws and you can charge up to two melee attacks instead of the usual one. It's the height of meh. Let's also not overlook the physical makeup of this thing you've willingly chosen to equip. It's basically a bunch of golden feathers protruding from your wrist, with all of them held in place by what appears to be a snap-on leather BDSM restraint. It's... different! But it's not going to up your Destiny 2 game. Sorry Claws of Ahamkara, you lose. 5. Apotheosis Veil Image: bungie Oh hey, look at that. Another Warlock exotic. Woopity scoop. Apotheosis Veil is somehow less useful than Claws of Ahamkara. It's got an exotic perk fully heals you and recharges your melee/grenade attacks whenever you activate your super. That's... nice. You really shouldn't be popping your super when you're at low health, though. Not unless you're wearing Apotheosis Veil, I guess. But why would you? There are better options. Looks alone give this one the edge over Claws of Ahamkara. What the hell is going on in there? Can our Warlock friend breathe? Is there some kind of cool space gas in there that activates your so-so exotic perk? Apotheosis Veil gives good screenshot, but little more than that. 4. Sealed Ahamkara Grasps Image: bungie Visually, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are a step up from the Claws' BDSM feathers. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these Hunter gauntlets. It's like someone polished and shaped a pile of fossils and glued it onto a sci-fi gauntlet. These rank higher than the Claws of Ahamkara largely because Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are not a Warlock exotic. The perk is also just provably better: You still get to charge up to two melee attacks, but you also have a chance of automatically reloading your weapon whenever you deal melee damage. It's almost as if Destiny itself is out to troll Warlocks. 3. Eternal Warrior Image: Bungie Eternal Warrior has one edge here over all the other exotics: It looks the coolest. It's a helmet that has its own face. What more do you need to know? It's also useful! Assuming it works the way its predecessor did, Titans get added damage resistance whenever their Fist of Havoc super is active. Eternal Warrior also makes Fist of Havoc last even longer. Most of all: It's not Warlock gear. Huge bonus for this (or any other) helmet. 2. Armamentarium Image: Bungie Armamentarium is what the Punisher would wear if he existed in the Destiny universe. Look at this thing. Those rows of bullets. The two breast grenades. A pair of Liefeld-ian pouches. This is an exotic for the Titan that is ready to go to war. It also happens to come with one of the most useful exotic perks in the game: Two grenades. It may not be as flashy as some of the others, but being able to store up as many as two grenade charges is never not useful in Destiny, especially for Titans, one of the most powerful grenade classes in the game. There are always things worth chucking grenades at in Destiny 2. 1. Fr0st-EE5 Image: bungie The Hunter is Destiny 2 's forgotten class, and that's a real shame for me, self-professed Hunter 4 Lyfe. But with the Fr0st-EE5 (pronounced ""frosteez"") coming back, that's all going to change. See all the tubes coming out of the boots in the image above? Those things charge up with power when you're sprinting around. That power then feeds into your abilities, speeding up your melee and grenade regeneration while you're running (you can also turn faster). Hey, you know what's terrible in Destiny 2 ? The recharge time on melee attacks and grenades. Bring on the Fr0st-EE5, baby. To lightly paraphrase what a wise Star Wars man once said: They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts. You can buy Destiny 2 here.","There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news.

Mark Kaufman,"The German government isn't just banning some children's smartwatches — its telling people to ""destroy"" the gadgets already circulating around the country. On Friday, Germany's telecom regulator the Federal Network Agency announced that a number of these devices, designed for ages 5 to 12, can allow someone to remotely tap into the watch's microphone and clandestinely spy from remote locations (just like a wiretap). The regulator isn't just concerned about the potential of people spying on children — it's concerned the devices can be used to spy on anyone. SEE ALSO: People think Facebook is listening to them. Here's how they're fighting back. And in Germany, it's illegal to record private conversations without permission. ""According to our investigations, parents were using the watches, for example, to listen in on teachers during class,"" said Federal Network Agency President Jochen Homann in a statement. Smartwatches that make phone calls, like the Apple Watch, are legal in Germany. The problem with many of the children's smartwatches, however, is the devices have a classic snooping function, similar to a baby monitor, which can be easily activated just by using an app. ""Via an app, parents can use such children's watches to listen unnoticed to the child's environment and they are to be regarded as an unauthorized transmitting system,"" said Homann. The German regulator is so serious about destroying these devices, it's asking citizens to literally document the watches' destruction and to file evidence online. Once the watches are destroyed, the regulator will provide a ""certificate of destruction,"" confirming the deed was done. This isn't the first time the Federal Network Agency told German citizens to destroy a consumer device. In February, the regulator prohibited the doll ""My Friend Cayla"" and labeled it as an ""espionage device."" Apparently, the dolls were fitted with radio transmission technology that could allow children to be spied on. Beware consumer tech manufacturers: The German government won't just ban devices that facilitate spying, they'll demand the devices be smashed with hammer (or whatever means of destruction one prefers) — even if they're dolls.","The German government isn't just banning some children's smartwatches — its telling people to ""destroy"" the gadgets already circulating around the country.

Ingrid Lunden,"GoFundMe, the popular fundraising juggernaut that now has 50 million users and has raised over $5 billion in funding for causes to date, is making an interesting change today that could see those numbers getting a boost — or at least help it fend off competition from other fundraising platforms like Facebook’s. GoFundMe is dropping the five percent Platform Fee that it charges to individuals when they launch personal campaigns on the platform (in the U.S. only for now), and it will instead rely on optional tips to generate revenues from these campaigns. GoFundMe said it is intentionally timing the change with the upcoming holiday season, although there is probably an eye to competition here: Facebook just yesterday announced that it was cutting the fees on its platform for campaigns from organisations, as a way of driving more organisations to using its platform over others for raising money. Personal campaigns, however, are still being charged a fee of between 6.9 percent and 8.8 percent on Facebook. “The holidays are a time for giving and generosity. GoFundMe is always looking for ways to make fundraising easier, faster, and more successful, and this time of year made perfect sense for introducing this pricing structure,” said Rob Solomon, GoFundMe CEO, in a statement. “From the beginning, our giving community has been incredibly generous. With this 0% platform fee, we will rely on voluntary tips from our donors to help with the costs associated with providing our best-in-class customer service, trust &amp; safety protections, and social fundraising technology.” The changes are coming at an interesting time for GoFundMe. As we have written before, the company has been growing by leaps and bounds for the last couple of years, most recently expanding into Europe and adding new features to the platform like video. But underlying the company’s growth has always been a persistent question: is it ethical or helpful to charge those in need (the theoretical premise of any GoFundMe campaign) a fee for the profit of GoFundMe itself? Now, in a sense, that question has been answered by GoFundMe removing that fee altogether, instead charging just for the processing that has a cost anyway. The company has actually been tinkering with its Platform fees for a little while now: for example when the service launched in Europe, it was charging 7.9 percent per donation plus $.30 processing. GoFundMe says that the donation or voluntary tip will appear in the form of a drop-down menu of percentages, plus the option of entering a custom amount. With the drop of the Platform Fee, donations in the U.S. to personal campaigns will still need to pay the standard 2.9 percent fees for payment processing (a charge to cover the costs charged by payment providers). Campaigns started by charities and any international campaigns still pay Platform Fees of five percent. We asked, and GoFundMe would not specify whether it plans to keep the no-fee structure in place permanently, or just for the holidays; nor would it say whether it plans to expand the scheme outside the U.S. “We can’t forecast the future, but this pricing structure is something we are excited to offer now,” the spokesperson said. “As always, we will be listening to our community and ensuring we can provide our renowned support, service and technology that makes us the most trusted brand for personal fundraising. We’ll be closely monitoring our community’s success with the new structure and evaluating as needed.” To date, GoFundMe has not disclosed the total amount it has raised in venture funding, nor its valuation. The company counts Accel, Iconiq, TCV, Stripes and more among its investors.","GoFundMe, the popular fundraising juggernaut that now has 50 million users and has raised over $5 billion in funding for causes to date, is making an interesting change today that could see those numbers getting a boost — or at least help it fend off competit…",2017-11-30T18:30:51Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","GoFundMe drops 5% Platform Fee for U.S. personal campaigns, adds tips",https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/gofundme-drops-5-platform-fee-for-u-s-personal-campaigns-adds-tips/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gofundme-logo-on-old-wall.jpg,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-5,1
"rfitzmaurice@businessinsider.com (Rosie Fitzmaurice), Rosie Fitzmaurice","Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. Alex Macheras 20-year-old Alex Macheras is a broadcast aviation analyst who flies around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even available to the public. He flew on the delivery flight for the Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft on December 13. Says Singapore Airlines' A380 first class suite is the ""hands down winner"" of all the competitors — including Emirates — for several reasons. Alex Macheras has a pretty cool job for a 20-year-old. As a broadcast aviation analyst, he spends his time jet setting around the world reviewing new first class cabins before they are even open to the public. Last week he took an empty flight from the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France to Changi Airport in Singapore for the delivery of Singapore Airlines’ first Airbus A380 aircraft, and shared his experience via his Instagram. Here he is being greeted by the cabin crew ahead of the 13-hour flight. Macheras told Business Insider that on these kinds of trips he spends the duration of the journey examining every aspect of the plane's cabins. ""I'm usually on my hands and knees in the suites testing out what it's like to work on the dining table, use the blinds, dim the lights, etc.,"" he said. His experience sounds similar to YouTube star Casey Neistat's when he took a trip in one of Emirates' newly-launched first class suites its Boeing 777 aircraft. After checking out all of the private cabin's features, Neistat called it the ""all-time greatest airplane seat."" However, Macheras, who has experienced the first class offerings from the likes of Emirates, Etihad, and Cathay Pacific, said there were a number of things about Singapore Airlines' new private suite that make it the ""hands down winner."" Here are the six reasons Singapore Airlines wins, according to Macheras. 1. The bed and seat are separate The core reason Singapore Airlines' A380 first class cabin is ""miles ahead of Emirates'"" is its concept, Macheras said. ""These days 99% of business class cabins feature a big seat that reclines into a fully flat bed — it's so common nowadays — but this suite has a seat and a bed,"" he explained. Alex Machers 2. It's more spacious than a 'central London apartment' The second reason is the space, he said. ""When we talk about spacious cabins in first class, it's usually about how much movement you have in your seat. ""With Emirates first class, it's a small area that is taken up pretty much by the seat, so you can just stand on the spot, but in the Singapore suite there was space to walk around. I'm known for my pacing on the phone — in fact I'm doing it right now — and I found myself pacing during the flight at 43,000 feet."" ""People have tweeted me saying it looks bigger than their central London apartment,"" he added. Alex Macheras 3. It has an understated, elegant style ""With all these airlines offering beds in their first class cabins, they have to differentiate themselves from competitors through the small details and quirks,"" Macheras said. ""Emirates is known for its glitziness and sparkly gold products, whereas Singapore is understated and elegant. It's low-lit like a boutique hotel, which appeals to many more people than the wild lights show of Emirates."" 4. The amenity kits are luxurious Luxury French brand Lalique has designed the new amenity kits as well as the pajamas and bedding for the first class suites. ""The new amenity kits were another thing that impressed me,"" Macheras said. ""But this isn’t just a plush blanket, it’s white crisp Lalique bedsheets that you might expect in a hotel room. The amenity kits are packed with Lalique fragrances, creams, balms, moisturisers, and even a scented candle. 5. The seat has a 'swivel' mechanism so you can face the window Alex Macheras The plush armchair featured in the Singapore Airlines' suite has an electronic swivel mechanism that means you can face any direction you want. ""What's the bonus in having this function? It's something I hadn't considered before I took this flight, but when you fly as much as I do, you've often seen all of the movies on offer,"" he said. Being able to reposition your seat means that you can soak up the views while aboard, he explained. ""When we flew over the Middle East it was 6 p.m. on the ground and the sun was setting and I caught this impressive sunset with so many different tones of orange,"" he said. ""I could just relax and watch it with my headphones in, without getting neck ache."" It also just so happened to be the peak of the Geminid meteor shower while he was on the flight, so while flying over Iran the aircraft was surrounded by shooting stars. ""In the space of about four minutes, I saw about 10 shooting stars,"" he said. 6. There's a 32-inch flat screen TV ""Finally, there's a 32-inch flat screen mounted on the wall of the suite, which is controlled by the tablet and can move left or right — it's like being in someone's living room.""

Nicole Gallucci,"Traveling by plane can be a nightmare filled with delays, turbulence, and not-so-great seatmates. But every once in a while a flight so good comes along to restore your faith in air travel.
Twitter user @alankruthahaha was recently blessed with a great plane experience, and live-tweeted it alongside GIFs from The Office for all of the internet to enjoy.
The story began when she was seated next to A Beautiful Boy on her three-hour flight, who just so happened to look a lot like actor Timothée Chalamet. After playing it cool for a half hour she struck up a conversation with him, saying, ""Hey, you look exactly like Timothée Chalamet,"" to which the mystery man smiled and replied, ""I get that a lot.""
flight takes off and head is exploding bc I *had* to know who this dude so 30 mins into the flight, I work up the courage and nudge him and ask hey you look exactly like timothee Chalamet to which he smiles and says I GET THAT A LOT pic.twitter.com/SaEpjOqOBE

After respecting his personal space for a bit, @alankruthahaha finally cracked and talked to her seatmate again. She confidently expressed her belief that he was the Timothée Chalamet, and you know what? He confirmed!
So I figured he didnt want to be disturbed and things I did in the process- ate a sandwich, peed twice, kept stealing glances at him and 1.5 hours in, he asked me when the flight was going to land and I couldnt hold it in and said I KNOW U R TIMOTHEE pic.twitter.com/fixN4Z9X4G

After properly introducing himself, @alankruthahaha asked him a series of pressing questions, such as why he was sitting in economy, if he's met Beyoncé, and how is Steve Carell. According to the tweets, the actor answered the questions patiently and even offered to FaceTime Steve Carell. NO BIG DEAL.
HE LAUGHED AND SAID AYYY YES IT IS, HI I AM TIMOTHEE and shook my hands and at this point I was basically shook/ stunned and I couldnt process anything pic.twitter.com/nYXovxWM4s

Like any hardcore Timothée stan, @alankruthahaha fangirled a bit and talked about Lady Bird, his Wikipedia page, and her past Google search to determine his height. But the 23-year-old actor was interested in @alankruthahaha's life as well.
What shocks me the most is this dude wanted to know about me. He asked me what I do, what project management is about (literally who cares timothee), where I grew up and PRONOUNCED MY NAME RIGHT pic.twitter.com/Z57pj2T2SS

Marcus Gilmer,"Things are getting more serious for Apple over the revelations that the company purposely slows down older phones. They could face criminal charges in France under a recently passed obsolescence law. SEE ALSO: Yes, Apple sometimes slows down old iPhones to prevent unexpected shutdowns A report from French outlet The Local (via The Verge ) detailed efforts by Halte à l’Obsolescence Programmée (HOP, translated as ""Stop Planned Obsolescence""), a group dedicated to ""raise awareness and influence for sustainable and repairable products."" HOP filed a complaint in a French court on Wednesday, setting itself apart from lawsuits filed in the U.S. and Israel by making it a criminal complaint, citing a violation of an ""energy transition"" law enacted in 2015. In their statement, HOP said (as loosely translated by Google): The law on the energy transition of 2015 prohibits ""the practice of planned obsolescence, which is defined by the use of techniques by which the person responsible for the marketing of a product aims to deliberately reduce the duration to increase the replacement rate. The complaint is therefore criminal; the law provides for a maximum sentence of two years in prison and up to 300,000 euros in fines and 5% of the annual turnover. TL;DR: By slowing down old phones, Apple is forcing people to replace them with new phones at a faster rate than they really should, violating measures for sustainability established by that 2015 law. HOP even has a form where you can submit any slowdown-related issues you've had with your iPhone. The first two lawsuits against Apple were filed in the U.S. a week ago, just a few days after Apple confirmed reports that it slowed down older models of its iPhone to preserve battery life. Several more U.S. suits and a class-action suit in Israel were added to the pile in the days following the first filings. But this French case is, so far, the only known criminal complaint filed against the tech behemoth, which has already faced turmoil over its tax situation in Europe and, more specifically, Ireland in recent years. Given that Apple stands to benefit handsomely (well, mostly ) from the newly signed GOP tax bill, they should have enough extra cash to throw at the problem until it goes away.","Things are getting more serious for Apple over the revelations that the company purposely slows down older phones.

Dieter Bohn,"The screen steals the show The greatest Apple product comeback story of the past few years has, without a doubt, been the Apple Watch. Launched with great fanfare four years ago, the initial version tried to do way too much with way too little, and it had confusing software to boot. Worst of all, it was unclear what the original Apple Watch was even for. No single thing stood out. Then Apple did what Apple often does: iterated, refined, and fixed. But as much as there were software and hardware improvements to the Series 2 and Series 3, the most important refinements were to the Apple Watch’s purpose. It gained clarity. It was for fitness and notifications. Eventually, when it was ready, Apple added better connectivity. Now, with the Series 4, Apple is iterating again. And, importantly, it’s learned how to iterate the product’s hardware and its purpose at the same time. The Series 4 has finally achieved something like the original goal of the Apple Watch. It’s not quite a do-anything computer on your wrist, but it can be different things to different people now. With apologies to the new iPhones, the Apple Watch Series 4 was the most impressive thing Apple announced last week. After using it for the past week or so, I think it lives up to the hype. For the first time since the original Apple Watch, the hardware has been fully redesigned, with a new body and new sizes. But it’s not a major overhaul. These still look like the Apple Watches you’re used to: they have the same rounded-corner lozenge shape, the same glass that curves around to match the body, and the same digital crown and single-button layout. Before we get too far, we should talk pricing. This Watch is not especially cheap. The smallest, least expensive model comes with GPS and Wi-Fi and costs $399. But if you start piling on the upgrades, you can quickly jack up the price to something that feels exorbitant, especially if you’re upgrading from a Series 2 or Series 3. It’s $29 more for the larger size, $100 for LTE compatibility (plus $10 per month or so from your carrier), and the stainless steel models are $200 more (and only come with LTE). Add in Apple Care, and you can end up spending a lot — though it’s nothing like the wild “Edition” prices of yore. (Don’t even get me started on the Hermès model.) The larger sizes don’t feel that much bigger than the older models The two new sizes are 40mm and 44mm, but they really don’t feel that much bigger on your wrist than the old sizes. I was using the 42mm Series 3 and the 44mm size is only subtly bigger, but it’s also subtly thinner. To me, it feels about the same, but I think the trade-off of size for thinness is worth it. I suspect the same will be true for people who prefer the smaller size, but my recommendation is to go to a store and try one on before buying. I’m really happy — and impressed — that Apple managed to make existing Watch bands fully compatible with the new sizes. Even my old third-party bands fit seamlessly into the new Watch body. Things look different when the screen turns on. The screen on the Series 4 is just incredibly good. Apple says it’s 30 percent bigger, which is one of those specs that’s easy to just sort of pass over when you read it. But 30 percent is a lot, and you absolutely notice it right away. It’s still OLED so the blacks are truly black and blend into the watchface glass. But if you pick a full-screen watchface, you’ll see that the screen also goes closer to the edges of the Watch than before, including the rounded corners. The overall effect makes the square display on my Series 3 look dumpy and cramped by comparison — even though, until last week, it was arguably the best smartwatch screen on the market. As John Gruber writes, “The Series 4 displays take up so much more of the face of the watches that the new 40mm watch’s display is larger than the display on the old 42mm models — the new small watch has a larger display than the old large watch.” Beyond the size and the screen, there are a few other subtle exterior differences to note about the hardware. The rear of the Watch is now ceramic instead of metal to allow for a better wireless signal. If you spring for the LTE model, the garish red dot on the digital crown has been replaced with a much more subtle red ring. The microphone has been moved between the two buttons so that it’s further away from the speaker to help reduce echo in calls. The speaker has been boosted to provide more volume. It really is way louder, and I haven’t heard any distortion during phone calls. Last year’s Apple Watch had some issues with LTE at launch, though Apple fixed it up fairly quickly. This year, I haven’t had any major problems with LTE. In fact, several people I called with the Watch simply didn’t believe I wasn’t on a phone. It sounds good, and the louder speaker means you can hear it without holding the thing next to your ear. But it does take the Watch a minute (sometimes two) to switch on LTE and get connected. That’s not radically worse than what happens when you pull your phone out of airplane mode, but on the Watch, it’s always a little less clear what’s happening and why when data is not coming in. On the inside, there’s a faster S4 processor, a W3 chip (which is just Apple’s W2 chip with Bluetooth 5.0 support), and an accelerometer and gyroscope that are able to take samples of your movements more often (which is how Apple was able to add the new fall detection feature). Apple’s also tied haptics to the digital crown, so when you spin it, you feel little ticks that precisely correlate to what’s happening on the screen. It’s completely unnecessary but pretty neat. Battery life has been stupendous Last but certainly not least: the battery size is about the same. Battery life on the Series 4 is as good or better than on the Series 3 Watch. Apple claims 18 hours of regular use or six hours of outdoor workouts. I haven’t done a six-hour outdoor workout (and I don’t plan to), but my testing shows the battery life far exceeds Apple’s own claims. I took the Watch off the charger on Saturday morning and wandered around Oakland for four hours while disconnected from my phone. I used LTE for maps, a couple calls, and GPS for tracking my outdoor walk “workout.” I was still at 50 percent at the end of that day, and I didn’t get below 20 percent by the end of my lazy Sunday (which also involved an hour or so of GPS tracking and some LTE data). The battery life is so good that I wish Apple gave me an option for an always-on ambient screen, maybe by turning off some radios. Alas, you still have to turn your wrist to see the time. watchOS 5 is kind of a grab bag of new features, which sounds dismissive, but I don’t mean it to be. It’s a good sign that watchOS is ready to be laden with features instead of rethought from the ground up, as it was in years past. There’s support for podcasts, Walkie Talkie mode, slightly improved (and grouped!) notifications, and a bunch of fitness and health options. But the thing people will probably pay the most attention to are the new watchfaces that are available on the Series 4 Watches. They’re designed to show off the new rounded-corner screen. Some are just sort of flashy animations, while others are chock-full of new complications in phantasmagoric colors. Of the new watchfaces, I am most fond of the animated ones. Apple says that the fire, water, and vapor animations were all created with practical effects. As in: literal fire, vapor, and water were filmed with high-speed cameras as they flowed on custom-welded rigs. They look great; the animations naturally flow right up to the rounded corners. The watchface that you’ll probably see the most in ads is called “infograph.” It takes the bigger screen of the Series 4 and fills it up with as many as eight complications. There’s a “modular” version as well that shows the digital time and six complications. Like many parts of watchOS 5, they use new, more rounded fonts, too. The infograph watchface is polarizing. I don’t like it at all, though I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a “ design crime.” There are just too many colors doing too many different kinds of work splashed all over the screen in a garish and show-offy way. Too many of Apple’s watchface options are like that. Call me boring, but I prefer a Watch look that’s a little more staid. It makes me a little sad that Apple still doesn’t allow third-party watchfaces. Even if you like the new watchfaces, you probably won’t like what happens when you try to select a new complication. There are now “old”- and “new”-style complications, which are completely different and incompatible. The newer watchfaces need the new complications, so third-party developers will have to update their apps (and so will Apple). You can’t add the Home app to the new watchfaces, only the old ones. The most annoying part is that there’s no way to know what complications are available on any given watchface without scrolling through and looking for the one you want. On the fitness front, the best new feature is automatic workout detection, which can tell if you’ve started or stopped a workout and ask you if that’s the case and if you want to log it. There are now options for yoga, hiking, setting a target pace, and tracking your pace. You can also see your cadence as you run and challenge somebody to a week-long exercise competition. (I didn’t extensively test these features; I’m still at the “fill your damn rings” stage of my exercise goals.) Maybe the most interesting change, though, is how Apple is more clearly separating out health features from the fitness stuff. There are a few new features in watchOS 5 and the Series 4 that are designed to help you detect health problems, not just encourage you to close those activity rings or run a marathon. That’s interesting because it more explicitly positions the Apple Watch as a device that can help detect health problems, making it something that people who can’t exercise that much might be more interested in. Apple, as always, is very careful to not cross the line into making actual health claims about its new features. It’s careful to say that the Watch can detect things like irregular heartbeats, not that it will. There’s a big difference between “tracking your fitness” and “monitoring your health” watchOS 5 is able to detect low heart rate now, in addition to high heart rate. Later this year, Apple will add detection for irregular rhythms and provide notifications for them. The big new feature on the Series 4 is that it can take an electrocardiogram (EKG) using electrodes built into the back of the Watch and the digital crown. It can then send a PDF of your results to your doctor. I wasn’t able to test that as it is coming later this year. Both irregular heartbeat detection and the EKG features have been granted “de novo” classification by the FDA, and that distinction is important, as Angela Chen explains : It’s important to understand that the FDA has “cleared” both apps, but that’s not the same as “approving” them. There are usually three ways to get the FDA involved in a new project, according to Jon Speer, co-founder of Greenlight Guru, a company that makes quality management software for medical device companies. The most advanced is FDA approval, which is done only for Class III products, or technologies that might have higher risk but also a higher benefit. (Think: implantable pacemakers.) Approval is the gold standard, and companies need to do a lot of testing to receive this designation. The Apple Watch is in Class II. For Class II and Class I, the FDA doesn’t give “approval,” it just gives clearance. Another new feature exclusive to the Series 4 is hard fall detection, thanks to a new 800Hz accelerometer and gyroscope that can that can measure up to 32 G-forces. The Watch should be able to tell if you’ve had a spill and ask if you’d like to call emergency services. If you don’t move for a full minute after falling, it can do that automatically and also send a message to your emergency contact. Apple is turning it on automatically for users who tell the Watch they’re over age 65, and it’s making it an option for younger users as well. I’ve tried to trigger it without hurting myself and I haven’t been able to, which I suppose is a point in the Watch’s favor. (My tests were far from scientific; I was just hurling myself at the couch.) Apple says that to build its fall detection algorithms, it used data from a study involving 2,500 participants over several years, and it also worked with assisted living facilities and movement disorder clinics. So throwing yourself into bed after a long day shouldn’t trigger it, but a fall from a ladder or tripping over a curb and flailing your arms as you hit the ground might. Again, Apple’s health claims are not that the Watch will detect these falls, but simply that it could. A lot of people were really excited about Walkie Talkie mode, but after testing it, I don’t think it’s especially compelling. Unlike those classic Nextel Push-to-Talk phones, Walkie Talkie mode on the Apple Watch is essentially just a FaceTime Audio call with a button you press to talk and little beeps and visual indicators to tell you if it’s your turn. When you send the first message, you have to wait for a connection to be made, and then it’s just tapping the screen and talking. The connection stays active until a few minutes after the last person finishes speaking. It’s neat, but it doesn’t feel as instant as a true PTT system. I also had connectivity problems with it, but that may have just been OS launch-day overloading. That said, it’s silly fun to push the big yellow button with your nose when it’s your turn to talk. I strongly recommended it. (If it becomes a thing, I want to make sure I get full credit for coining the term “nose calls.”) Siri on watchOS 5 is still Siri. There’s a new feature that lets you simply lift your wrist and start taking instead of pushing a button or saying “Hey Siri,” and it works really well. The Siri shortcuts you set up on your iPhone should also work from your Watch, too. Siri still feels super unreliable, though. Siri gets especially fussy when you have a spotty connection. Too often, when I wanted to ask a question, I’d be met with a “hang on…” message, followed by a “I’ll tap you when I’m ready” message, followed by an interminable wait during which I’d forget whatever it was I needed Siri for. One last little watchOS 5 thing I must mention: you can open links to webpages now, too, which is kind of fun. Articles you click on get put into readability mode, so you don’t have to worry too much about ads or bad layouts on your Watch. Hooray for the web! This year’s Apple Watch is incredibly good. If you use it just for notifications and step counting, it’s probably overkill, but it’s able to handle more advanced features better than any other smartwatch I’ve tested. Mapping, music, workouts, calls, texting, podcasts… most of the stuff I could imagine wanting from a smartwatch works better than ever before. The only real bummer is that I still don’t feel like I can trust Siri to do everything I’d like reliably, and that’s more of an intermittent hassle than a real killer. If you’re looking at this Watch with an eye toward the health features, I have to admit that they’re difficult to test: the new features could be very compelling to a lot of people. Passive monitoring for heart problems and falls could literally be lifesavers, but they aren’t all available yet, and we’d need to see third-party lab testing to really make a call there. The Apple Watch has earned its place as the best-selling watch For people who are looking to upgrade an existing Apple Watch, that’s a harder question to answer than usual. Spending four to six hundred bucks for a bigger screen is a luxury I wouldn’t casually recommend to anybody, even though the screen is wonderful. Many of watchOS 5’s best features will work fine on more recent Apple Watches, too. Yes, there are exclusive watchfaces on the Series 4, but that’s also a silly thing to drop so much money for. What I can tell you is this: the Apple Watch has earned its place as the best-selling watch. It’s at least an order of magnitude better than other smartwatches and fitness trackers. Nearly everything it is designed to do, it does very well. It’s not yet a general purpose computer for your wrist, but, thankfully, Apple isn’t aiming for that anymore. The Watch is for doing little bite-sized versions of phone things like texting and listening to music, it’s for fitness, and it’s for health monitoring. Now that Apple has figured out what the Apple Watch is for, the Series 4 just makes it better. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Marcus Gilmer,"It seems Scott Pruitt suffered one scandal too many as Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday afternoon that he's accepted Pruitt's resignation effective Monday. I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2018...on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2018 Pruitt's resignation letter was later shared online. Despite what Trump hailed as an ""outstanding job,"" Pruitt's time as the head of the EPA will most be remembered for a never-ending cycle of scandals, from soundproof booths to first class air tickets to wild goose chases just for a certain type of lotion and a used Trump Hotel mattress. And there's load more, from seeking a Chick-Fil-A job for his wife and then a Republican Attorneys General Association job for his wife to having staffers put his hotel rooms on their credit cards to... well... you get the idea. Still, Pruitt managed to use his shortened time at the EPA to throw a lot of wrenches in how the agency worked, limiting the number of scientific studies they used, downplaying evidence of climate change, and completely dispensing with research on things like greenhouse gases. More than any of these other officials who flamed out in Trump's Washington, Pruitt leaves a legacy that will long outlive his short tenure. His actions while in office will ensure the U.S. will emit more greenhouse gases than it would have otherwise, thereby setting back efforts to tackle global warming. He also made it more likely for people to be sickened from potentially dangerous chemicals on crops and in the air and water, and may have played a decisive role in determining the next car you buy. Among other things Pruitt has done at the EPA: Shrunk the EPA to Reagan-era levels, with scores of experts on protecting public health and the environment leaving for the private sector or opting for early retirement. Literally took down the EPA's website on climate change. Cast doubt on the mainstream scientific evidence showing that human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global warming, and went so far as to push for televised debates between climate scientists and climate deniers. Pruitt took a hammer to the Obama administration's landmark climate change regulations. Moved to halt the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants Took action to revisit the Obama administration's fuel economy standards, aimed at incentivizing the development of cleaner-burning cars and catalyzing demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. Pruitt's legacy will linger for years, well beyond Trump's administration, no matter how long that lasts. And it will leave even more work for his successors just to undo the damage he's wrought, not to mention fight the new challenges that are building.

GINIA BELLAFANTE,"The company will arrive in Long Island City at a time when whole blocks in Manhattan and Brooklyn are distinguished by their empty storefronts, a consequence largely of rising commercial rents but also of the submission to fatigue over principle that occurs every time someone who genuinely believes in the importance of a thriving local merchant class shops by refusing to leave the house. While theoretically Amazon might have established a fund to help the world of small businesses it has managed to destabilize, the company did not offer and, perhaps more tellingly, the city made no such demand. Instead the company will provide space on its new campus for artists and nascent entrepreneurs, which further aligns it with an image of urbane creativity that nearly every tech company seeks to maintain. In corporate philanthropy, self-interest is nearly always clasping the hand of largess. Will the arrival of Amazon really be a boon to Queensbridge, the vast public housing complex, nearby, as Bill de Blasio seems to believe? (The synergy, as he put it, is going to be extraordinary.) The company has agreed to spend $5 million on job-training programs and internships and to participate in job fairs for a few years. But even if that were deemed sufficient, these developments would unfold within the context of the significant pay gap that plagues the technology industry in New York. Two years ago, research from the Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development found that Latinos earned, on average, two-thirds of what their white counterparts did, and blacks made half as much. Beyond that, in choosing New York and suburban Washington over the Pittsburghs and Denvers that Amazon had said it was considering, it already made its elitist commitments very clear. It would not be seduced by the notion of experimentation; it would go where it was most likely that standing in line at a CVS at 7 in the evening, you would run into someone from the Harvard class of 2004. The second decade of the 21st century has been a golden period in the history of American urbanism, as midsize cities have undergone a renaissance, with cities like San Antonio growing at a faster rate than places like Los Angeles or Boston. This is the outcome, to some extent, of the affordability crisis in major American cities and the dispersal of cultural capital that has come with it. Once moribund downtown neighborhoods in Birmingham, Ala., or Providence, R.I., for example, are full of new galleries, theaters, restaurants, businesses. Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of Amazons search process and its result is that it chose not to join that narrative, to further stimulate the engines of growth. (As part of its announcement this week the company said it would open a smaller operations facility in Nashville, but honestly, isnt that like winning the steak knives when you really wanted the Buick?)",Is it O.K. to shop on Amazon for everything and still not want to give one of the world’s richest companies a tax break to invade Queens?,2018-11-14T20:33:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Amazon and the Urban Hypocrite,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/nyregion/amazon-shoppers-headquarters-queens.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/nyregion/18big/18big-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1

Paulina Dedaj,"Authorities in New York arrested a 14-year-old boy on Friday for allegedly vandalizing the memorial of a slain Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor recipient. Suffolk County Police received a call on Thursday that the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Park in Lake Ronkonkoma had been “vandalized.” A picture released by police on Facebook showed that a granite stone with an image of the fallen soldier had been shattered. By 3 a.m. Friday, detectives had arrested the unidentified teen in his home. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took to Twitter earlier to say he was “appalled and disgusted” and promise that the state would pay for the replacement of the defaced plaque. The park, where Murphy was once a lifeguard, was dedicated to him in 2009, on what would have been his 30 th birthday. Murphy was killed while conducting “a reconnaissance mission” in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. He and other members of his SEAL team were “scouting” a well-known terrorist when they were ambushed by an enemy force 50-strong.

Patton, of Boulder City, Nev.; and Lt. Michael P. Murphy, of Patchogue, N.Y. With the exception of Luttrell, all were killed June 28, 2005, by enemy forces while supporting Operation Red Wing. (Navy) “Despite the intensity of the firefight and suffering grave gunshot wounds himself, Murphy is credited with risking his own life to save the lives of his teammates,” his Summary of Action read. After two hours of fighting, Murphy, Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class (SEAL) Danny Dietz and Sonar Technician 2nd Class (SEAL) Matthew Axelson were dead. Navy file photo of SEAL Lt. Michael P. Murphy, from Patchogue, N.Y., and sonar technician (surface) Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew G. Axelson, of Cupertino, Calif., taken in Afghanistan. Both were assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Murphy and Axelson were killed by enemy forces during a reconnaissance mission, Operation Red Wing, June 28, 2005. They were part of a four-man team tasked with finding a key Taliban leader in the mountainous terrain near Asadabad, Afghanistan, when they came under fire from a much larger enemy force with superior tactical position. (Navy) “By his undaunted courage, intrepid fighting spirit and inspirational devotion to his men in the face of certain death, Lieutenant Murphy was able to relay the position of his unit, an act that ultimately led to the rescue of Luttrell and the recovery of the remains of the three who were killed in the battle.” Marcus Luttrell, the only surviving member of the team, took to Instagram to shame the “coward” that had vandalized the memorial. The suspect was charged with second-degree criminal mischief, and was scheduled to be arraigned in family court at a later date, Fox 5 reported. Paulina Dedaj is a writer/ reporter for Fox News.

Beth Skwarecki,"Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain. But AIs aren’t all run by mega-corporations and governments; you can download some algorithms and play with them yourself, with often hilarious results. There’s the faux Coachella poster full of fake band names, created by feeding a bunch of real band names into a neural network and asking it to come up with some of its own. There are the recipes created in a similar way, where “barbecue beef” calls for “1 beer - cut into cubes.” And then there’s my favorite, Janelle Shane’s AI-generated paint colors (tag yourself, I’m Dorkwood). Humans aren’t nearly as creative as we think. Craft brewers, for example, have run out of fun names … Read more Read These were all made with neural networks, a type of AI modeled on the network-like nature of our own brains. You train a neural network by giving it input: recipes, for example. The network strengthens some of the connections between its neurons (imitation brain cells) more than others as it learns. The idea is that it’s figuring out the rules of how the input works: which letters tend to follow others, for example. Once the network is trained, you can ask it to generate its own output, or to give it a partial input and ask it to fill in the rest. But the computer doesn’t actually understand the rules of, say, making recipes. It knows that beer can be an ingredient, and that things can be cut into cubes, but nobody has ever told it that beer is not one of those things. The outputs that look almost right, but misunderstand some fundamental rule, are often the most hilarious. I was happy to just watch these antics from afar, until Shane mentioned on Twitter that a middle school coding class had generated better ice cream names than she had. And I thought, if kids can do this, I can do this. How to Train Your First Neural Net I started with the same toolkit Shane used for ice cream flavors: a python module called textgenrnn, by Max Woolf of Buzzfeed. You’ll need a basic knowledge of the command line to work with it, but it works on any system (Mac, Linux, Windows) where you’ve installed the programming language/interpreter python. Before you can train your own neural net, you’ll need some input to start with. The middle school class started with a list of thousands of ice cream flavors, for example. Whatever you choose, you’ll want at least a few hundred examples; thousands would be better. Maybe you’d like to download all your tweets, and ask the network to generate you some new tweets. Or check out Wikipedia’s list of lists of lists for ideas. Whatever you choose, get it into a text file with one item per line. This may take some creative copy-and-paste or spreadsheet work, or if you’re an old hand at coding, you can write some ugly perl scripts to munge the data into submission. I’m an ugly perl script kind of girl, but when I ended up wanting Lifehacker headlines for one of my data sets, I just asked our analytics team for a big list of headlines and they emailed me exactly what I needed. Asking nicely is an underrated coding skill. (If you’d like to feed Lifehacker headlines into your own neural net, here is that list. It’s about 10,000 of them.) Create a folder for your new project, and write two scripts. First, one called train.py: from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn() t.train_from_file(‘input.txt’, num_epochs=5); This script will get the neural net reading your input and thinking about what its rules must be. The script has a couple things you can modify: t = textgenrnn() is fine the first time you run the script, but if you’d like to come back to it later, enter the name of the.hdf5 file that magically appeared in the folder when you ran it. In that case, the line should look like this: t=textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5’) ‘input.txt’ is the name of your file with one headline/recipe/tweet/etc per line. num_epochs is how many times you’d like to process the file. The neural network gets better the longer you let it study, so start with 2 or 5 to see how long that takes, and then go up from there. It takes a while to train the network. If you’re running your scripts on a laptop, one epoch might take 10 or 15 minutes (bigger data sets will take longer). If you have access to a beefy desktop, maybe your or a friend’s gaming computer, things will go faster. If you’ve got a big data set, you may want to ask it for a few dozen or even hundreds of epochs, and let it run overnight. Next, write another script called spit_out_stuff.py (you’re free to give these better names than I did): from textgenrnn import textgenrnn t = textgenrnn(‘textgenrnn_weights.hdf5') t.generate(20, temperature=0.5) This is the fun part! The script above will give you 20 fun new things to look at. The important parts of that last line are: The number of things to generate: here, 20. The temperature, which is like a creativity dial. At 0.1, you’ll get very basic output that’s probably even more boring than what you fed in. At 1.0, the output will get so creative that often what comes out isn’t even real words. You can go higher than 1.0, if you dare. When you ran the training script, you’ll have noticed that it shows you sample output at different temperatures, so you can use that to guide how many epochs you run, and what temperature you’d like to use to generate your final output. Not every idea your neural network comes up with will be comedy gold. You’ll have to pick out the best ones yourself. Here are some of the better Lifehacker headlines that my AI came up with: The Best Way to Make a Baby Laptop How to Survive a Backspace Drinking Game The Best Way to Buy a Job Interview How to Get the Best Bonfire of Your Life With This Handy Graphic How to Make Your Own Podcast Bar How to Get a New iPhone X If You’re an Arduino How to Clean Up Your Own Measurements in a Museum How to Get Started With Your Stories and Anxiety The Best Way to Make Your Own Ink Out of the Winter How to Keep Your Relationship With an Imaginary Concept The Best Way to Make a Perfect Cup of Wine With a Raspberry Pi The Best Way to Eat a Toilet Strawberry How to Get a Better Job on Your Vacation The Best Way to Eat a Stubborn Jar I got these by playing with the temperature and the number of training epochs, and every time I saw something I liked I copied it into a text file of my favorites. I also experimented with the word-by-word version of the algorithm; the scripts above use the default character-by-character model. My final list of headlines includes results from both. If you’re curious about some of the rejects, here’s what I get with a 0.1 temperature: The Best Way to Stay Streaming to Stop More Alternative to Make Your Phone The Best Way to Stream the Best Power When You Don’t Need to Know About the World The Best Way to Stay Started to Stay Started to Your Common Ways to Stop Anyone How to Get the Best Way to See the Best Popular Posts The Best Way to Stay Started to Make Your Phone And if I crank it up to 1.5 (dangerously creative): Remains of the Day: How to Ad-Finger the Unsubual Renew Qakeuage to Travel History, Ovenchime, or “Contreiting Passfled The Risk-Idelecady’t Two-Copyns, Focusing Zoomitas Ifo Went Vape Texts Battery Oro crediblacy Supremee Buldsweoapotties DIY Grilling Can Now Edt My Hises Uniti to Spread Your Words Clearly, human help is needed. Become Your AI’s Buddy Even though neural nets can learn from data sets, they don’t truly understand what’s going on. That’s why some of the best results come from partnerships between people and machines. “I know it is a tool that I use,” says Janelle Shane, “but it is hard not to think of it as—‘come on little neural network, you can do it’ and ‘Oh, that was clever’ or ‘You’re getting confused, poor little thing.’ To make the most of your relationship, you’ll have to guide your AI buddy. Sometimes it might get so good at guessing the rules of your data set that it just recreates the same things you fed it—the AI version of plagiarism. You’ll have to check that its funny output is truly original. Botnik studios pairs people with machines by training predictive-text keyboards. Imagine if you picked up your friend’s phone, and typed messages by just using the predictive text on their keyboard. You’d end up writing your own message, but in a style that reads like your friend’s. In the same way, you can train a Botnik keyboard with any data source you’d like, and then write with the words supplied by the keyboard. That’s where this amazing advice column duel came from: two Botnik keyboards trained on Savage Love and Dear Abby. If you’d prefer to work against, rather than with, your algorithmic buddy, check out how Janelle Shane pranked a neural net that at first appeared to be good at recognizing sheep grazing in a meadow. She photoshopped out the sheep, and realized the AI was just looking for white blobs in grass. If she colored the sheep orange, the AI thought they were flowers. So she asked her Twitter followers for sheep in unusual places and found that the AI thinks a sheep in a car must be a dog, goats in a tree must be birds, and a sheep in a kitchen must be a cat. Serious AIs can have similar problems, and playing with algorithms for fun can help us understand why they’re so error-prone. For example, one early skin-cancer-detecting AI accidentally learned the wrong rules for telling the difference between cancerous and benign skin lesions. When a doctor finds a large lesion, they often photograph it next to a ruler to show the size. The AI accidentally taught itself that it’s easy to spot cancerous tumors: just look for rulers. Another lesson we can learn is that an algorithm’s output is only as good as the data you feed in. ProPublica found that one algorithm used in sentencing was harsher on black defendants than white ones. It didn’t consider race as a factor, but its input led it to believe, incorrectly, that the crimes and backgrounds common to black defendants were stronger predictors of repeat offenses than the crimes and backgrounds associated with white defendants. This computer had no idea of the concept of race, but if your input data reflects a bias, the computer can end up perpetuating that bias. It’s best that we understand this limitation of algorithms, and not assume that because they aren’t human they must be impartial. (Good luck with your hate speech AI, Facebook!) Mix Up Your Data Sets There’s no need to stop at one data set; you can mix up two of them and see what results. (I combined the product listings from the Goop and Infowars stores, for example. Slightly NSFW.) You can also train a classifying algorithm. Shane says she already had a list of metal bands and a list of My Little Pony names, so she trained a classifier to tell the difference. (Pinky Doom: 99 percent metal.) Once you have a classifier trained, you can feed anything into it and get a reading. Benedict Cumberbatch: 96 percent metal. You can also feed anything you like into a trained textgenrnn network. When you specify how many items you want and what temperature (creativity) the network should use, you can also give it a prefix. It will then try to come up with words that should follow that prefix. After I trained the Lifehacker headlines, I asked the AI to give me headlines beginning with “3 Ingredient Happy Hour.” It responded with some wonderful fictional cocktails (again, these are my picks out of a longer list): 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Herb Stressful Upgrade 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Cake’s Strawbreak 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Darkled Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Pizza and Beverage For They Are Trader Wings 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Ferrent Pot 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Throat Into a Refreshing 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Bar Order 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Leftover Party Controci 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: A Summer Rum Cutting 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Best Coconati 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Beautiful Shicline 3 Ingredient Happy Hour: The Cheekey Candy Don’t be surprised if you see these in a future Lifehacker post; Claire Lower, our food and beverage editor, says she wants to attempt making some of these. But instead of waiting for her expert recipes, I decided to feed these into a neural network as well. I gathered some cocktail recipes from Chris Lowder’s cocktail guide and the WikiBooks cocktails glossary, and arranged them so that each cocktail took up one line of a text file, with the title of the cocktail as the first few words. That means I could choose a cocktail name and ask my cocktail-trained neural net to provide the recipe that follows. Here are a few of the results: The Best Coconati - oz. Benedictine e. 1 dash Aromatic b. &lt;1 oz. Cranberry d..5 oz. Lemon c..75 oz. Iteloun d. 2 dashes Juponged Slipes i. Stir/Strain/Coupe/No garnish The Cheekey Candy i. 1 oz. Blendey Sherry b. 1.5 oz.

Egg White in large rocks glass with dets 1934 or makes Babbino﻿ The Lifehacker c. 14 Vodka Martini i..75 oz. Campari i. Shake/Fine strain/Coupe/Lemon twist The input data was only a few hundred cocktail recipes, so I had to turn the temperature way up to get anything interesting. And at a high temperature (1.0, in this case), sometimes you get words that aren’t really words. Good luck finding any Lonstine Brandy or Blendey Sherry in a store—but if you do, my pet AI will be very happy.","Artificial intelligence (AI) seems poised to run most of the world these days: it’s detecting skin cancer, looking for hate speech on Facebook, and even flagging possible lies in police reports in Spain.

Steve Dent,"Fujifilm X-H1 Fujifilm's $1,900 X-H1, announced just last month, is a big leap over the X-T2, especially when it comes to video. It's Fujifilm's first camera with 5-axis in-body stabilization and can shoot photos at 14fps and handle true DCI 4K video (4,096 x 2,160). It has a brand-new, class-leading 3.69-million-dot EVF, excellent handling, thanks to dual dials and a chunky new grip, and a ""near-silent"" shutter mode. As for drawbacks, it lacks the 10-bit, 4:2:2 video of the like-priced GH5, and is a lot heavier than Sony's A6500. If that's too much : For a bit less, the $1,600, 24.3-megapixel X-T2 is essentially the predecessor to the X-H1 and offers similar performance and excellent handling, but no image stabilization. Panasonic GH5 I liked the $2,500 GH5s a lot, but as a video-specific camera, it's hard to recommend it to photographers. The $2,000 GH5, however, does both things well for less money. You can shoot DCI 4K video (and even 6K anamorphic) with 10 bits (billions) of colors and a 4:2:2 gamut, the best specs for a consumer camera. And with a 20.1-megapixel sensor and 12fps shooting speed, it won't limit photographers, either. As for shortcomings, the GH5 has mediocre contrast-detection autofocus and a smallish Micro Four Thirds sensor. If that's too much : The $1,700, 20.3-megapixel G9 is now Panasonic's flagship photography camera, offering 20fps shooting with continuous autofocus, 5-axis stabilization and, of course, 4K video -- without the GH5's 10-bit color and HDR. DSLRs Nikon D850 The $3,300 D850 is Nikon's first full-frame 4K camera, but it was worth the wait. With a 45.7-megapixel sensor, it's among the highest-resolution DSLRs on the market, bested only by Canon's 50.6-megapixel, $3,500 5Ds models. That gives the D850 unsurpassed image quality, but you still get decent speed (7fps burst shooting) and an excellent phase-detect autofocus system. The main negatives of the D850 are mediocre 4K video quality, slow and indecisive contrast-detect autofocus in live and video mode and autofocus tracking that's a step below Nikon's (excellent) D5. If that's too much : Consider Nikon's D7500. For just $1,200, you get excellent image quality from the 20.6-megapixel, DX (APS-C) sensor, decent 8fps shooting speeds and 4K video (with a 1.5X crop of the already-cropped DX sensor). If you don't mind an older camera, Nikon's $1,800 D750 offers a full-frame sensor, fast shooting speeds and great autofocus for nearly half the price of the D850. Canon 5D Mark IV Having arrived in 2016, Canon's 5D Mark IV is due for a refresh, but it's still one of the top enthusiast DSLRs on the market. The 30.4-megapixel full-frame sensor with dual-pixel autofocus provides excellent quality for professional portrait or landscape work, and it performs well even at high ISOs. For video, you get 4K with autofocus tracking that's widely considered the best in the business. A big downside for video, however, is the 1.64x crop factor in 4K and lack of a flippable screen for vlogging. If that's too much : Canon's $1,200 80D offers excellent Dual Pixel autofocus for video and live view, 7fps shooting speeds and, for video shooters, microphone and headphone ports. Sony Alpha A99 II Yes, Sony does make a DSLR, albeit one with an SLT translucence mirror that doesn't flip out of the way when you shoot, as on Nikon or Canon DSLRs. The $3,200 A99 II 's hybrid-like nature gives it some incredible specs, like a 12 fps shooting speed with eye tracking -- not bad for a camera with 42.2 megapixels of resolution. You also get 5-axis image stabilization, DSLR-like handling and excellent-quality 4K video. On the downside, the autofocus system, especially the subject tracking, doesn't work so well for video, and because of the SLT mirror, the A99 II doesn't perform as well in low light as the A7R II and III models. If that's too much : Take a look at Sony's aging $1,200 A77 II APS-C SLT camera. It offers equally quick 12fps shooting speeds with 24.3 megapixels of resolution, in-body stabilization and an effective autofocus system. Compact cameras Fujifilm X-100F Fujifilm's compact, fixed-lens cameras have been popular since the original Finepix X100 launched nearly seven years ago. The latest model, the $1,300 X-100F, has refined the formula to a T. You get a 24.3-megapixel X-Trans CMOS III sensor (with no low-pass filter), an f/2.0 35mm (full-frame equivalent) lens, more ergonomic button layout and gorgeous looks. All of that comes in a pocketable size, making it an ideal street-photography or vacation camera. There's no 4K video, but it can handle 1080p 60fps shooting, and video is not really the point anyway. Sony RX10 Mark IV The 20.1-megapixel RX10 Mark IV with a Type 1 (1-inch) sensor is not pocketable and, at $1,700, ain't cheap either. But it's incredibly fast and versatile for a compact superzoom, with a 24–600mm (full-frame equivalent) f/2.4–f/4 lens and unbelievable 24fps RAW shooting speed. Naturally, it shoots 4K and slow-motion video at up to 960fps (912 x 308). If you can handle its large form factor and price, you'll be able to shoot both landscapes and the look on your kids' faces when they score a goal -- even if you're in the nosebleed section. Sony RX1R II For $3,200, the Sony RX1R II is clearly not for everyone. But it's the only compact camera on the market with a full-frame sensor (other than the 24-megapixel, $4,000 Leica Q), and it packs an incredible 42.4 megapixels of resolution. With a 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens, retractable 2.4-million-dot OLED viewfinder and 102,400 max ISO, this is aimed at street photographers. As such, unlike with other Sony compacts, you don't get 4K video, and will have to settle for 1080p at 60fps. Wrap-up Enthusiast cameras do offer it all, but in different doses, depending on what you want. More so than any category, pure photographers might want to focus on DSLRs, while videographers will probably run toward mirrorless cameras. Specs aside, for either category, you'll want to choose a system with autofocus that works best for your needs. Considering the money you'll be spending, it might be best to rent or borrow a camera before buying to ensure that it does what you need.","When photography or filmmaking becomes a consuming passion or a career rather than a hobby, you might look longingly at fancier equipment.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Cheers of encouragement are a great morale booster, but every marathoner has fond memories of that spectator, the one who had the perfect snack or motivating words at a tough point in the race. Heres how to be that angel.
Decide where you want to be
First, a word about planning. A marathon is 26.2 miles long, and many races run a half-marathon at the same time. The half is 13.1 miles, but its course may diverge from the main event. Be sure to check the races website to know who is running and where, and station yourself appropriately. A rough guide: 
Mile 5: Everybody is feeling good
Mile 10: Half marathoners are getting tired but they know the finish is coming soon. Full marathoners are getting tired and trying not to think about it. 
Mile 15: Things are starting to get rough. Most of the runners have been on the course for 2+ hours. Theyre cramping, theyre hungry, their legs hurt. But theyre still moving.
Mile 20: This is the low point for a lot of runners. Theres a saying that you can split a marathon into two halves: the first 20, and the last 6.2. Most runners passing the 20-mile mark are, or soon will be, exhausted and desperate.
Mile 25: This is the home stretch! The runners have been through a lot but they know theyre almost at the finish.
World class marathoners will make it through the course in a little over 2 hours (for men) or two and a half (for women). People who take 3+ hours are experienced, strong runners; those who take 4+ would often describe themselves as recreational athletes. People who take 5+ hours are usually mixing in some walking with their running, and/or started with one of the other groups but ended up really struggling. 
With this information, you can decide where to set up, and when. Since this is a multi-hour event, you may want to find a few spots and move between them. Consider who will pass by your station, and how they might be feeling. 
Hand out food
Posters and cheers are greatand well get to thosebut if you really want to do something special, have a snack or drink that the marathon doesnt officially provide. These are especially appreciated in the later miles of the race. Some ideas: 
Orange slices, or other juicy fruit
Gummy worms, or other candy thats not too hard to eat on the run
Starchy food, like pieces of plain bagel (this is the one time its acceptable to cut them St. Louis style) 
Salty food, like pretzels or chips
Beer
Cold coffee (I havent seen this in person, but there is demand for it) 
Cookies, cake balls, or anything delicious. These folks havent eaten anything delicious all day. 
Remember that people will be grabbing the snacks with sweaty hands and little to no coordination. (They will also be much less interested in cleanliness at mile 20 than at mile 10). Plan accordingly, and make things easy to grab. Small portions are better than large ones; people can always take two. 
Provide relief from hot weather
Marathons tend to be in the spring and fall, to avoid the years hottest weather. A typical marathon day is cold at the start and warms during the course of the race. That means that by mile 15 or 20, the sun may be beating down on runners who are already feeling beaten-up. If its a hot day, consider helping folks cool down: 
If you live along the race course, set out your sprinkler or even just stand around with a garden hose and let people run through. 
This one is great for kids: bring a super soaker, and a sign encouraging runners to ask for a squirt. 
Bring a cooler full of...well, anything cold. Fla-vor-ice popsicles are cheap and you can cut them in half with scissors.
Give motivation
This category is the cheapest, but it can be the most thoughtful. Theres a lot you can say to a runner to give them the strength to carry on. Not everybody will be receptive to your message, but youll make the difference for somebody. 
High fives. Seriously, just stand on the sidewalk and hold your hand out. Ill totally perk up and run across the street for a high five from a kid. 
Creative high fives, like a poster that says tap for a power up or wear a Mario costume and give fist bumps
Yell the name on peoples bibs. A lot of marathons let you put your name on the bib under your number, or people will sometimes sharpie their name on their shirt. Cheer them on by name, or by description: Lookin strong, pink shirt! You got this!
Funny signs, like genuinely funny ones. I appreciate Most Boring Parade Ever and Seems like a lot of work for a free banana. Senses of humor vary, but do your best.

A poster with details of a Houthi rebel attack on a Saudi Arabian frigate using an autonomously navigating small boat packed with explosives in 2017. Autonomously navigating boat components from the Shark-33 robot suicide boat. In a presentation that echoes assertions by another administration that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction, US officials have created a display of evidence that the Trump administration hopes will trigger further action against Iran. In a hangar at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, DC, today, Department of Defense (DOD) officials accompanied by US United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley put on display debris from what they claim are Iranian-built ballistic missiles and other weapons recovered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The presentation comes as the Secretary General of the United Nations is scheduled to release a report on Iran's lack of compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. Haley says the report ""describes violation after violation of weapons transfers and ballistic missile activity. Aid from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to dangerous militias and terror groups is increasing... Its ballistic missiles and advanced weapons are turning up in warzones across the region. It's hard to find a conflict or a terrorist group in the Middle East that does not have Iran's fingerprints all over it."" And those fingerprints, according to the display presented for the press today in the hangar, are all over the two ballistic missiles and other weapons. The components all bear marks tying them to manufacturers in Iran. This is proof, according to a DOD report, that Iran is illicitly shipping highly destructive weapons to anti-government forces in Yemen for use against Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Gulf as part of its efforts ""to sow instability and promote violence throughout the region."" Haley said that the US government had invited representatives from other nations, including ""the entire UN Security Council,"" to see the evidence on display. ""And we are inviting all members of Congress to view it. This evidence is part of what has led the US intelligence community to conclude, unequivocally, that these weapons were supplied by the Iranian regime. The evidence is undeniable. The weapons might as well have had 'Made in Iran' stickers all over it."" The ballistic missiles fragments were, according to DOD analysis, pieces of two Iranian Qiam missiles. The first targeted the Yanbu terminal—a major Red Sea oil facility on Saudi Arabia's west coast. It was launched July 24 and was not intercepted by Saudi missile defenses. It caused a major fire near the terminal, though there was little detail given at the time by Saudi Arabia about the damage done. The second, launched on November 5, was aimed at King Khalid International Airport near Riyadh; the Saudi Arabian government claimed to have intercepted the missile with its Patriot missile batteries, but other reports suggest that the Patriot system may have hit the falling booster of the missile after it had separated from the warhead. Saudi Arabian officials have suggested they may consider the attack on the airport as an ""act of war"" by Iran. President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the Riyadh attack, but Mohammad Ali Jafari, the chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, disputes the claim. Video of the November 5 ballistic missile launch by Houthi forces toward Riyadh. Ansar Allah—the Houthi insurgent group­—claimed that the missiles were a domestic version of the Iranian-built Qiam, a variant of the Russian R-17M (""Scud-C"") ballistic missile. The Qiam is essentially a Scud-C without control fins. But Defense Department experts displayed components from the missiles with manufacturer stamps that show they were of Iranian origin, as were the other weapons on display. Iran is one of the few nations with an active missile development program that is not a member of The Hague Code of Conduct Against Missile Proliferation, an export control regime that prohibits the export of ballistic missile systems. (There are 138 member states, including the US.) But that's not uncommon for the region—Israel, Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are all non-signatories as well. However, Iran has been specifically sanctioned by the UN Security Council for its illegal exportation of ballistic missile systems because of its nuclear program. Iran's ballistic missile development program is considered by some Security Council member states (including the US, Japan, and Sweden) to be against the spirit of the Security Council's resolution 2231, which specifically calls out nuclear weapons development, and to be ""destabilizing."" Russia and China have largely shrugged off the continued development, arguing that it's not a violation unless the missiles are designed specifically to deliver nuclear warheads. The resolution does not prevent Iran from other missile and space development. Other evidence presented by the DOD included Iranian uncrewed vehicles designed to act as weapons. One, the Qasef-1 uncrewed air vehicle, is a surveillance drone that ""can be used as a one-way attack drone,"" said Defense Department spokesperson Laura Seal, ""diving on targets Kamikaze-style and detonating its warhead upon impact. It is a member of the Ababil UAV family, designed and produced by the Iranian government.” The other autonomous weapon of Iranian origin presented was the Shark-33 ""explosive boat""—or rather, several components of it. The Shark is a high-speed small boat that carries an anti-ship payload. ""There are more than half a dozen pieces of evidence demonstrating that these components are directly traceable to Iran,"" Seal said. ""What makes the Shark 33 so dangerous isn't just that it can explode. It has a guidance system allowing it to track and hit a moving target without an operator on board, so the boat can be deployed to blow up a ship without sending someone on a suicide mission. The computer and sensors serve as that unmanned guidance system for the Shark 33—and they are supplied by Iran."" DOD officials say that the Shark-33 was used to attack a Saudi naval vessel, the frigate HMS al Madinah, off Yemen in February, blowing a six-and-a-half foot hole in its side and killing two crewmembers. It had previously been thought that the Houthis had made the attack with an anti-ship missile.

https://www.facebook.com/CBS6News/,"MONTVILLE, Conn. – A former substitute teacher was arrested Thursday for starting a ""fight club"" at a Connecticut high school, according to police. Instead of supervising Montville High School students as they studied, 23-year-old Ryan Fish is accused of encouraging students in his class to fight while others watched. Fish was arraigned in Norwich Superior Court Thursday on four counts of second-degree reckless endangerment, two counts of risk of injury to a minor and one count of breach of peace, according to the Hartford Courant. “I didn’t realize what was happening at the time,” said Ryan Fish. “I didn’t have the training to know what was going on.” State police believe otherwise. “He’s not a certified teacher,” said Montville Resident State Trooper Sargent Mark Juhola. “It bothers me that so many teachers work so hard to get where they are and that this wasn’t a teacher but he was in that role.” Juhola said Fish oversaw at least three scheduled fights last October involving five male students ages 14 to 16. Montville police began investigating after an injured student told a social worker he’d been beaten and robbed at school. Police said cellphone video shows Fish encouraging the students and moving items out of the way so the teenagers could continue fighting. After being confronted about the fighting on October 10th, 2017, police said Fish told the principal that “boys will be boys.” Montville Public Schools Superintendent Brian Levesque fired Fish later that day. But Sgt. Juhola said school officials never contacted police and only acknowledged the incident during the police investigation. “Anytime a student is put in any type of injurious situation they need to contact the police department,” Juhola said. Fish told WTIC that he was wrong, and was just trying to be friends with the students. “I am so sorry...To be perfectly honest I was just trying to reach the kids. I thought these kids were just being rambunctious I just thought they needed an out."" Students also told police Fish allowed them to draw lewd photos on the classroom board and admitted to doing drugs. Fish was released on a promise to appear and is due back in court on May 8.","wtvr.com Substitute teacher ran 'fight club' during math class, police say wtvr.com MONTVILLE, Conn. – A former substitute teacher was arrested Thursday for starting a ""fight club"" at a Connecticut high school, according to police.

MATTHEW HAAG,"During his prime in the mid-1970s, White never seemed to tire. He led the team in points and assists in back-to-back seasons, and he played in 488 consecutive games, a Celtics record. In Game 5 of the 1976 N.B.A. finals, White played 60 of the 63 minutes in a triple-overtime thriller often called the greatest game ever played. He led all players with 33 points and nine assists in a 128-126 victory over the Phoenix Suns. The Celtics went on to win the title in six games, and White was named the most valuable player. Asked about how he managed to play almost the entire Game 5, White credited his conditioning. “I was tired, but I was conditioned to go the distance,” he said in an interview several years ago. “My thinking was that if I was tired, the other players were close to death.” Photo White, right, and his teammate John Havlicek embracing after the Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks to capture the 1974 N.B.A. championship. Credit Associated Press From the time he first emerged as a standout player on the national stage, White had an uncanny ability to pull up at the top of the key and sink a clutch shot. A quick dribbler, he could cut through defenses before passing the ball to open teammates. But when a game was close with time expiring, White often had the ball. In college at the University of Kansas, White hit a 32-foot last-second shot that would have knocked out Texas Western in the 1966 N.C.A.A. tournament if not for a ruling by referees that he had stepped out of bounds. Texas Western eventually won the game and later defeated Kentucky, becoming the first team with five black starting players to win the national championship. “White does everything better than any man of his size I have ever seen,” Phog Allen, the former men’s basketball coach at Kansas, told Sports Illustrated in 1967. “Watch him and you think he’s floating in oil.” Joseph Henry White was born Nov. 16, 1946, in St. Louis, the youngest of seven children to George White, a Baptist minister, and the former Elizabeth Guynn. White earned his nickname, Jo Jo, in high school when one of his coaches, trying to get his attention, hollered his name twice. Photo White in 2015 when he was announced as a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images White is survived by his wife, Deborah, whom he met in 1980 when she lived in his apartment building in Boston. Information about other survivors was not immediately available. White, a top national recruit out of McKinley High School in St. Louis, chose to play college basketball at Kansas, about a four-hour drive west from his home via Interstate 70. By his sophomore year, he had caught the attention of professional teams awed by his ability to pass, rebound, dribble and shoot. He won a gold medal with the United States men’s basketball team in the 1968 Summer Olympics and entered the 1969 N.B.A. draft as one of the top players. But teams had concerns because of White’s commitment to serve in a brief stint in the Marine Reserves after college. The Celtics drafted him ninth over all, and he was able to join the team earlier than expected after the Marines granted him early release. Off the court, White personified the class and elegance of a winning franchise. A sharp dresser, he was held up as an example for his teammates by Red Auberbach, the legendary Celtics coach who was the team’s general manager when White played. “Look around you when the Celtics travel, they dress well,” Auberbach said after the team won the 1976 finals, two years after the team won the first championship with White. “If you dress like a champion, you’ll play like one.” Continue reading the main story",White played 10 seasons for the Celtics and helped lead the team to N.B.A. championships in 1974 and 1976.,2018-01-17T04:53:51Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Jo Jo White, Deadeye Shooter for Boston Celtics, Dies at 71",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/obituaries/jo-jo-white-dead-boston-celtics.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/sports/17white1/17white1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
Andrew Freedman,"Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space. However, a new study shows that you're not likely to get the flu from a passenger seated more than 1 meter, or 3.3 feet, away from you. The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, claims to be the first to rigorously test the spread of viruses — specifically influenza — that are transmitted via large droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Researchers from Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Boeing employed teams of observers in pairs, sitting every five rows down in economy class in single-aisle aircraft during 10 transcontinental flights in 2012 and 2013. These observers watched and recorded the movements of passengers during the flight using an iPad app. SEE ALSO: 3 of 4 kids who've died from flu this year weren't vaccinated, say federal doctors The study used the movement of each passenger to simulate the spread of influenza virus from a passenger seated in the mid-cabin (seat 14C, to be exact), and an infectious crew member. The researchers developed a new model of the network of contacts passengers and crew members had with one another, as well as a simulation model of disease spread, to find out how many additional people would get sick while on typical flights that last between 4 and 5 hours. The results were surprising. On average, an infectious passenger seated in the mid-cabin had the potential to infect an additional 0.7 additional people per flight. However, if an infectious crew member chose not to stay home, and did not take medication to limit their coughing, then that infectious crew member would infect an additional 4.6 passengers per flight, the study found. ""Our model simulations yield that an infected flight attendant could infect several passengers, and we quantify this. This provides additional support for the policy of preventing crew members from working when sick,"" said study lead author Vicki Stover Hertzberg, of Emory University. The study found that people sitting in window seats who did not get up to go use the restroom or check the overhead bin had far less exposure to infectious passengers than people sitting at the aisle, or people who spent time in line waiting for the restroom at the back of the cabin, for example. So, come next flu season, you might want to pick a window seat and avoid getting up. ""If they select the window seat to minimize those exposures, they also need to stay there (i.e., don’t move). When they move, they increase their exposures,"" Hertzberg said. The study has some significant limitations. It does not apply to illnesses transmitted via smaller particles known as aerosols, which include tuberculosis, measles, and other dangerous pathogens. ""These tiny particles need not fall within a meter of the infected passenger,"" Hertzberg said. ""They can stay suspended in the cabin air for long periods of time, be taken up by air recirculation systems, etc."" The study also didn't quantify the risk of getting sick from viruses located on air cabin surfaces, such as an armrest or seatbelt. And it doesn’t apply to twin-aisle, larger aircraft used on long-haul flights, or quick shuttle flights, such as from Boston to Washington, D.C. The bottom line, though, said study co-author Howard Weiss, also of Emory, is that ""If you practice good hand hygiene, keep your hands away from your face, and if you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected by influenza during an 4 to 5 hour flight.""","Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space.

Matt Novak,"The U.S. Air Force has released the first images of its latest combat drone, the XQ-58A Valkyrie. The new aircraft, which went from concept to first test flight in 2.5 years, behaved as expected on its first test flight this week, according to the Air Force.
The 76-minute inaugural flight occurred on March 5, 2019 at Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona. The Air Force released a short 15-second video of the first flight to show it off, something that the military doesnt do with all of its aircraft.
The drone was developed for the Air Force Research Laboratorys (AFRL) Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) program which seeks to develop new planes for the military both quickly and inexpensively. 
XQ-58A is the first example of a class of UAV that is defined by low procurement and operating costs while providing game changing combat capability, Doug Szczublewski, AFRLs XQ-58A Program Manager, said in a statement.
The XQ-58A drone reportedly has a range of well over 2,000 miles and can carry both precision-guided bombs and surveillance equipment.
As Tyler Rogoway at The Drive notes, the new drone is specially suited to operate at the direction of manned planes nearby under a concept the Air Force calls its loyal wingman program. Theoretically, a piloted fighter jet could travel alongside a number of these unpiloted Valkyries, which would assist by doing everything from jamming enemy radar to firing on a target.
Rogoway also notes that the finished drone looks remarkably like the earliest concept renderings that were released by its developer, the San Diego-based military contractor Kratos Defense. Kratos is on the forefront of the latest weapons technologies, having recently developed the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System system for the U.S. Navy. Laser weapons, which fall into the category of directed-energy weapons, are being shown off by Americas New Cold War adversary Russia with increased frequency.
The cost of the XQ-58A Valkyrie program wasnt released publicly, but the best estimates put the budget at roughly $2-3 million per plane.

Victoria Song,"Facebooks nightmare 2018 might be over, but its 2019 is just getting started. A federal judge ruled Monday to make public a new batch of court documents detailing how Facebook made money off children.
The documents come from a 2012 class-action lawsuit and will be made public thanks to requests by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. A sneak peek into records given to the nonprofit in October reportedly shows Facebooks own employees were concerned they were effectively tricking children into racking up thousands of dollars in game charges. The documents also indicate Facebook failed to give parents refunds, according to Reveal.
The lead plaintiff in the case involves a child who unwittingly racked up thousands in charges while playing a Facebook game. In this instance, the child was unaware Facebook had his mothers credit card on file as the kid unwittingly bought virtual currency, according to court documents, which resulted in several hundred dollars in charges over a few weeks. While the mother requested a refund from Facebook, the company did not comply, and the family ultimately filed a lawsuit.
According to Reveal, the records also highlight how some Facebook employees raised concerns that parents were being charged without their consent. One example cited by Reveal indicates the social media giant knew the average Angry Birds player on the platform was just 5 years old. Facebook also reportedly knew that in nearly all cases, parents did not think their children would be able to make additional purchases without authorization or passwords, and that children were likely to be confused as in-game currency wouldnt appear to be real money to minors.
One particularly disturbing exchange involves two Facebook employees debating whether to issue a refund request involving a child who inadvertently charged over $6,000 in just two weeks. The child is described as a whale, a casino term used to describe reckless spenders.
Gillian: Would you refund this whale ticket? User is disputing ALL charges
Michael: Whats the users total lifetime spend?
Gillian: Its $6,545 but card was just added on Sept. 2. They are disputing all of it I believe. That user looks underage as well. Well, maybe not under 13.
Michael: Is the user writing in a parent, or is this user a 13ish year old
Gillian: Its a 13ish yr old. says its 15. looks a bit younger. she* not its. Lol.
Michael: I wouldnt refund
Gillian: Oh thats fine. cool. agreed. just double checking
Yuck. Expect more messed up details to come to light in the coming days. Facebook has about 10 days to make the majority of the documents, which total over 100 pages, public.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Everyone from Margot Robbie to Mary J Blige gathered in Los Angeles on Monday for the traditional Oscars ""class photo"". This year's Academy Awards contenders rubbed shoulders at the annual nominees' luncheon, which took place four weeks before they will regroup for ceremony itself. While the catering team at the Academy are probably getting sick of the sight of Meryl Streep, we certainly aren't. And nor do we ever tire of the irregularities and intriguing outfits which are always provided by the class photo. Here are 11 things we spotted this year. (Fortunately, Vanity Fair's Photoshop editor wasn't there to help so this is one Hollywood photo where nobody was given an extra leg.) 1. Firstly, is that... a cardboard cut-out? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes, yes it is. At 89 years old, Agnes Varda has already become the oldest nominee in Oscars history. The Belgian-born director is nominated in the best documentary film category for Visages Villages [Faces Places]. Sadly, Agnes couldn't make it to the luncheon in person. So her co-director JR held up a cardboard cut-out of her instead. We don't know why nobody has thought of this before - just think of all the weddings she must get out of attending. (Actually, does anybody know where you order one of these?) 2. Hey look it's Mitzeee from Hollyoaks Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk We don't often use the words ""Hollyoaks"" and ""Oscars"" in the same sentence. But, there she is, third row from the front and fourth from the right: Rachel Shenton. The Silent Child, written by Shenton and directed by another former Hollyoaks actor, Chris Overton, is nominated for best live action short film. ""I don't class myself as a writer so I felt grossly underqualified doing this,"" she said last month. But she certainly isn't out of place in this year's class photo. 3. This chap has been going to the gym and he'd like you to know about it Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk ""Oh this? Oh it's just my bicep. I'd totally forgotten it was there! Goodness gracious, what am I like, eh?"" That's Dunkirk cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema in the back row. 4. Eric Fellner would make a poor spy Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk The co-chairman of Working Title films might have managed to stay behind the scenes as a producer of Victoria &amp; Abdul but had less success going undetected here, peering out from behind the giant statuette. Of course, he may have been placed there deliberately given his uncanny resemblance to Oscar himself. 5. Basketball injuries went unnoticed Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's Common in the back row, nominated for best original song alongside Diane Warren for Stand Up For Something from the film Marshall. The rapper was looking so dapper you probably wouldn't notice he was actually trying to hide a black eye. He wore a pair of glasses in the hope of trying to hide the bruise he sustained after a basketball mishap at the weekend. 6. Not everybody was successful in looking at the camera Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's always one. Or, in this case, two. We've all been Mudbound director Dee Rees at some point and managed to blink at the precise moment a photo is being taken. (Although in our case it only affects our 62 Instagram followers rather than the millions of people that will see an iconic and significant piece of film history.) Sam Rockwell did keep his eyes open, but smiling and looking at the camera proved too much. 7. People in Los Angeles really need to stop using Justin Timberlake's tailor Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk After last year's trouser-gate, we really thought 2018 would be different. Not only is Raphael Saadiq sporting a rather brave beige trousers/grey socks combo, but the tailor had clearly run out of fabric by the time the music producer got round to ordering an outfit. WHEN WILL THEY LEARN? *shakes fist* 8. It wasn't all grey Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk In a sea of dull suits and generic ties, a few brave souls stood out from the crowd with a splash of colour. We particularly salute make-up artist Daniel Phillips, Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan and The Big Sick writer Emily V Gordon. We don't care if they don't win any actual trophies - they have already won this year's photo. 9. Quite a lot of men aren't there? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes. 126 to be precise. With 46 women. (And one of them is a cardboard cut-out.) It's an issue Academy president John Bailey is aware of, making reference to the gender imbalance when he spoke at the luncheon. ""The Academy is at a crossroads of change,"" he said. ""We are witnessing this motion picture academy reinvent itself in front of our very eyes, and a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."" 10. Kobe Bryant is sitting down Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Which is a very sensible idea, given that he's six-and-a-half feet tall. Had he been allowed to stand up, he certainly would have obscured Breadwinner director Nora Twomey and make-up artist David Malinowski at the very least, who were right behind him. They probably could have sat him on the floor and he'd still tower over half the people there. 11. But which nominees are missing from this photo? Image copyright Getty / PA Well, Daniel Day-Lewis is absent, because of course he is. (Possibly because he was busy ordering a bigger trophy cabinet from Ikea.) He wasn't the only Phantom Thread star who didn't make it though - best supporting actress nominee Lesley Manville is nowhere to be seen either. Elsewhere, Christopher Plummer was also absent from the luncheon, although he could probably be edited in later. Denzel Washington and Woody Harrelson, nominated in the best actor and supporting actor categories respectively, also sent their apologies. Perhaps one of the most notable absentees is best actress favourite Frances McDormand, who's nominated for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Bonus: The 'alternative' picture Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk As is tradition, the photographer also took a ""fun"" version of the photo, where the nominees were encouraged to pull funny faces or different poses. Several just applauded, others put their thumbs up, but full marks go to Watu Wote: All of Us director Katja Benrath, in the front row, for the slightly-more-original rock on hand sign, and Dear Basketball animator Glen Keane for managing to obscure his own face with his arm while waving from the fifth row.

Harish Jonnalagadda,"Earlier this year, ASUS turned the tables on Xiaomi with the ZenFone Max Pro M1, a budget phone with a huge battery and enticing hardware that went toe-to-toe with the Redmi Note 5 Pro and came out ahead in a few areas. ASUS not only managed to undercut the Redmi Note 5 Pro but was also able to make enough units available to meet the deamnd for the M1, which Xiaomi still struggles with today. We've already seen how the ZenFome Max Pro M1 fares next to the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but it makes sense to pit the device against Xiaomi's latest phone as both devices are running pure Android. The Mi A2 falls under the purview of Android One, whereas ASUS is offering a ""stock"" Android ROM with a few ZenUI underpinnings. For its part, the Mi A2 has plenty going for it. The device is powered by the Snapdragon 660, which is more powerful when compared to the Snapdragon 636 in the M1, and has class-leading front and rear cameras. With the Mi A2 set to go on sale later this week in India for ₹16,999 ($250) and the ZenFone Max Pro M1 available for ₹12,999 ($185), it's time to see how the M1 holds up next to Xiaomi's latest Android One phone. Xiaomi Mi A2 vs. ZenFone Max Pro M1: Specs Category Xiaomi Mi A2 ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 Operating System Android 8.1 Oreo Android One Android 8.1 Oreo Display 5.99-inch 18:9 FHD+ (2160x1080) IPS LCD panel Gorilla Glass 5 5.99-inch 18:9 FHD+ (2160x1080) IPS LCD panel SoC Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 4x2.2GHz Kryo 260 + 4x1.8GHz Kryo 260 14nm Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 Eight Kryo 260 cores up to 1.8GHz 14nm GPU Adreno 512 Adreno 509 RAM 4GB/6GB 3GB/4GB/6GB Storage 32GB/64GB/128GB 32GB/64GB/64GB Expandable No Yes, dedicated up to 2TB Rear camera 12MP (f/1.75, 1.25um) + 20MP (f/1.75, 1.0um) PDAF, LED flash, 4K video recording 13MP Omnivision 16880 f/2.2 + 5MP f/2.4 PDAF, LED flash 4K video recording Front camera 20MP (f/1.75, 1.0um) AI portrait mode LED Selfie light Beautify 4.0 8MP f/2.0 1080p video recording Connectivity LTE with VoLTE Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.0 GPS, GLONASS LTE with dual VoLTE Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2 with AptX GPS, GLONASS Micro-USB, 3.5mm audio jack Battery 3000mAh battery Quick Charge 4.0 (India) QC3.0 (ROW) USB-C 5000mAh battery Fast charging (5V/2A) Fingerprint Rear fingerprint Rear fingerprint Dimensions 158.7 x 75.4 x 7.3mm 159 x 76 x 8.46mm Weight 166g 180g Colors Black, Rose Gold, Gold, Blue Meteor Silver, Deepsea Black There's a lot of similarities between the Mi A2 and the ZenFone Max Pro M1. Although ASUS didn't team up with Google to launch the M1 with Android One, the user interface on the device is near-identical to what you get on the Mi A2. The Mi A2 is rocking an aluminum unibody chassis, with the M1 offering a metal alloy back with plastic inserts for the antennae and an aluminum mid-frame. Going with a mix of materials has allowed ASUS to cram a monstrous 5000mAh battery in the M1 while still bringing the overall weight down to an easily manageable 180g. Neither phone stands out from an aesthetic standpoint, and although the Mi A2 feels slightly better to hold in day-to-day usage, it isn't going to win any design awards. Both devices feature 5.99-inch 18:9 FHD+ panels, and you get little in the way of display color customization. On the software front, both phones are currently running Android 8.1 Oreo. What the Mi A2 does better The Mi A2 is Xiaomi's most powerful phone in the $250 segment yet, with the device powered by the Snapdragon 660. The M1 meanwhile features a Snapdragon 636, which has similar cores that are clocked lower. You're not going to see a huge difference between the two devices in real-world usage scenarios, but the Mi A2 has a slight edge when it comes to gaming thanks to higher clocks on the Adreno 512 GPU. The highlight with the Mi A2 is the front and rear cameras. Xiaomi has mentioned that its main goal for 2018 is to improve the camera quality on its phones, and we've seen that over the course of the year with the Redmi Note 5 Pro, Mi Mix 2S, and now the Mi A2. The 12MP + 20MP cameras at the back do a fantastic job both in daylight and low-light scenarios, and it's clear that the phone has a considerable edge over the M1 when you look at just a few samples. The 20MP front camera is also a considerably upgrade from what the M1 has to offer, with Xiaomi touting AI-assisted portrait mode along with a front LED module that kicks in during low-light conditions. Xiaomi Mi A2 on the left, ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 on the right. And while the M1 has an uncluttered user interface, as the device isn't under the Android One program, there's no telling when it will pick up the Android Pie update. As for the Mi A2, Xiaomi has stated during the launch that the device will be one of the first third-party devices to pick up the stable Android Pie build, and although we haven't been told a timeline, it is reasonable to assume that the update will be delivered before the end of the year. What the Max Pro M1 does better The ZenFone Max Pro M1 doesn't hold up to the Mi A2's cameras, but it utterly destroys Xiaomi's handset when it comes to battery life. With a 5000mAh battery under the hood, the M1 manages to easily deliver two days' worth of usage with some charge left over. Honestly, if you're looking for a phone with the best battery life in this segment, then the M1 is an easy recommendation. ASUS has also managed to do a better job with the basics — the M1 has a 3.5mm jack as well as a dedicated MicroSD slot in addition to two SIM card slots. The MicroSD slot can fit in a 2TB SD card, and the phone has dual VoLTE. All of the aforementioned features are integral to budget devices, and they're missing from the Mi A2. The M1 does one better by including AptX support, which makes a lot of difference when streaming media over Bluetooth. Finally, the M1 has an edge when it comes to actual sales. All signs point to Xiaomi sticking to a flash sales model for the Mi A2, which if history is anything to go by will make it difficult for customers to get a hold of the device. In contrast, ASUS is selling the ZenFone Max Pro M1 in an open sale on Flipkart. If you're interested in picking up the device, all you need to do is hit up the link below and shell out ₹12,999 ($185). See at Flipkart What should you buy? Down to you The camera on the Mi A2 is the one to beat in this segment, and if you're one to take a lot of photos, then the Mi A2 is a no-brainer. The phone is missing the 3.5mm jack and a MicroSD slot, but it isn't as big a deal when you factor in just how good that camera is in day-to-day usage conditions. Xiaomi includes a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle in the box, and the 64GB of internal storage should be more than enough for most users. If you require more storage, then you're better off waiting for the 6GB/128GB variant to launch in the country. There's no specific timeline for a launch, but it should be in the coming months. See at Amazon India If you're looking for a device with a two-day battery life, then you'll love what the Max Pro M1 has to offer. ASUS has done a masterful job with the M1, and the device is one of the best budget phones you can buy in 2018. Sure, the camera isn't as good as what you get on the Mi A2, but the device has outstanding battery life and has features that target a more mainstream audience, like the 3.5mm jack and a MicroSD slot. See at Flipkart","You can choose between a great camera or outstanding battery life, but not both.

Eric Berger,"Enlarge / A Soyuz rocket launches from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. reader comments 4 As recently as 2013, Russia's venerable fleet of rockets commanded nearly half of the global share of the commercial launch market. Since then the emergence of other players, most notably SpaceX, has considerably shrunk the once-dominant Russian position. This year, although Russia has made 17 successful orbital launches, only about a third of them have flown for paying customers other than the Russian government or the International Space Station. By contrast, SpaceX has made 16 launches this year, 11 of which have been for commercial customers. A SpaceX projection for 2018 suggests that disparity will continue to grow if the company continues to increase the flight rate of its Falcon 9 rocket. Recognizing its dimming market position, the Russian rocket corporation, Energia, has fast-tracked development of a new medium-class launch vehicle that it is calling Soyuz-5. This rocket could both replace the existing Soyuz rocket that carries cosmonauts and astronauts into space, while competing with SpaceX for commercial payloads. According to Russian space reporter Anatoly Zak, Russian officials have high hopes for the launch vehicle. ""Even more importantly, the Kremlin saw the new-generation vehicle as the Russian response to the American challenge on the commercial launch market, making the work on the Soyuz-5 booster especially urgent,"" Zak writes. The big achievement for Russia, Zak says, is potentially completing preliminary design work on the new rocket this year, which keeps Energia on track to bring the Soyuz-5 vehicle to market by late 2021. The three-stage rocket will be powered by RD-171 engines that will burn kerosene fuel. (SpaceX's Merlin engines also burn rocket-grade kerosene fuel.) Left unstated in the Russian press is that SpaceX is unlikely to stand still between now and 2021. Four years ago, the company was still launching the initial, expendable version of its Falcon 9 rocket, one that could lift about 10.5 tons to low-Earth orbit. Next year, however, SpaceX is likely to debut the fifth and final version of its Falcon 9 booster, optimized for reusability and likely with a capacity of 23 tons to low-Earth orbit. If that rocket is even a modest success, which seems plausible given SpaceX's recent progression, then when the Soyuz-5 rocket debuts in 2021 it won't be competing with a Falcon 9 rocket that costs $60 million and has a backlog in launches. Rather, with rapid reusability, it seems more likely that by then SpaceX will be capable of launching nearly on demand, for some fraction of $60 million.",The Russian plan seems to depend on SpaceX standing still.,2017-11-13T16:43:31Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Russian rocket to compete with SpaceX “racing” to launch pad in 2021,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/russian-rocket-to-compete-with-spacex-racing-to-launch-pad-in-2021/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8116894761_553d19901f_k-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-5,1

You know you’ve learned something when you can explain it to a new student. Richard Feynman was a famously good professor, as he could explain physics simply and entertainingly. Just watch him do it, it’s astounding. Even his lectures are satisfying to read. That’s the promise of the Feynman Technique. You can read something and hope that it’ll all be beamed into your brain for future… Read more Read 3.

noreply@blogger.com (Richard Byrne),"One of the questions that I'm frequently asked at the beginning of the school year goes something like this, ""do you know how I can download videos from YouTube?"" I do know how to do that, but I won't teach you how to do that because it is a violation of YouTube's terms of service. But I will show you how you can display YouTube videos in your classroom without showing the sidebar related video suggestions and comments. Here are five tools that you can use to display YouTube videos without showing the related video suggestions and comments. ViewPure is one of my longest standing recommendations for viewing YouTube videos without distractions. At its basic level to use View Pure just copy the link of a video into the ""purifier"" on the View Pure website and then click purify. Your ""purified"" video will be displayed on a blank white background. You can password-protect links to videos that you share through ViewPure ( click here for directions). In the last year ViewPure expanded to offer curated collections of educational videos. Watchkin is a service that provides a few ways to watch YouTube videos without seeing the related video suggestions and comments. You can enter the direct URL of a video into Watchkin to have the sidebar content removed. You can search for videos through Watchkin and have family-friendly results displayed (if a video appears that is not family-friendly Watchkin has a mechanism for flagging it as inappropriate). Watchkin also offers a browser bookmarklet tool that you can click while on YouTube.com to have the related content disappear from the page. Quietube is a convenient tool that you can add to your browser's bookmarks bar. With Quietube installed you can simply click it whenever you're viewing a video on YouTube and all of the related clutter will be hidden from view. Installing Quietube requires nothing more than dragging the Quietube button to your toolbar. Tube is a free tool that provide a minimalist view of YouTube. When you go to the Tube website the only things you will see are ""Tube,"" a disclaimer, a link to the developer's Twitter account, and a search box. Enter your search terms into the Tube search box and a list of results appears below it without showing any advertising or other sidebar content. When you click one of the videos in the search results it is displayed nearly full-screen on a plain white background. SafeShare.tv makes it possible to view YouTube videos without displaying the related videos and associated comments. To use SafeShare.tv simply copy the URL of a YouTube video and paste it into SafeShare.tv. SafeShare also offers browser a bookmarklet tool that will eliminate the need to copy and paste links from YouTube into SafeShare.

In this article, you can learn how to build the animated note display from the Awwwards website. It discusses the HTML5 SVG circle element, its stroke properties, and how to animate them with CSS variables and Vanilla JavaScript.
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is a standard XML-based markup language for vector graphics. It allows you to draw paths, curves, and shapes by determining a set of points in the 2D plane. Moreover, you can add twitch properties on those paths (such as stroke, color, thickness, fill, and more) in order to produce animations.
Since April 2017, CSS Level 3 Fill and Stroke Module allow SVG colors and fill patterns to be set from an external stylesheet, instead of setting attributes on each element. In this tutorial, we will use a simple plain hex color, but both fill and stroke properties also accept patterns, gradients and images as values.
Note: When visiting the Awwwards website, the animated note display can only be viewed with browser width set to 1024px or more.
A demo of the final result (Large preview)
File Structure
Lets start by creating the files in the terminal:
 mkdir note-display
 cd note-display
 touch index.html styles.css scripts.js
HTML
Here is the initial template that links both css and js files:
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Note Display&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./styles.css""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;script src=""./scripts.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Each note element consists of a list item: li that holds the circle, the note value, and its label.
List item element and its direct children: .circle, .percent and .label. (Large preview)
The .circle_svg is an SVG element, that wraps two &lt;circle&gt; elements. The first is the path to be filled while the second is the fill that will be animated.
SVG elements. SVG wrapper and circle tags. (Large preview)
The note is separated into integer and decimals so different font sizes can be applied to them. The label is a simple &lt;span&gt;. So, putting all of this together looks like this:
&lt;li class=""note-display""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
The cx and cy attributes define the circles x-axis and y-axis center point. The r attribute defines its radius.
You have probably noticed the underscore/dash pattern in classes names. Thats BEM, which stands for block, element and modifier. It is a methodology that makes your element naming more structured, organized and semantic.

To finish the template structures, lets wrap the four list items in an unordered list element:

 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You must be asking yourself what the labels Transparent, Reasonable, Usable and Exemplary mean. The more acquainted you get with programming, you will realize that writing code is not only about making the application functional, but also assuring that it will be long-term maintainable and scalable. That is only achieved if your code is easy to change.
The acronym TRUE should help decide if the code you write will be able to accommodate change in the future or not.
So, next time, ask yourself:
Transparent: Are code changes consequences clear?
Reasonable: Is cost benefit worth it?
Usable: Will I be able to reuse it in unexpected scenarios?
Exemplary: Does it present high quality as an example for future code?
Note: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz explains TRUE along with other principles and how to achieve those through design patterns. If you havent taken some time to study design patterns yet, consider adding this book to your bedtime reading.
CSS
Lets import the fonts and apply a reset to all items:
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Raleway:200');
* {
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 box-sizing: border-box;
}
The box-sizing: border-box property includes padding and border values into an elements total width and height, so its easier to calculate its dimensions.
Note: For a visual explanation on box-sizing, please read Make Your Life Easier With CSS Box Sizing.
body {
 height: 100vh;
 color: #fff;
 display: flex;
 background: #3E423A;
 font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive;
}
.display-container {
 margin: auto;
 display: flex;
}
By combining the rules display: flex in the body and margin-auto in the .display-container, its possible to center the child element both vertically and horizontally. The .display-container element will also be a flex-container; that way, its children will be placed in the same row along the main axis.
The .note-display list item will also be a flex-container. Since there are many children for centering, lets do it through the justify-content and align-items properties. All flex-items will be centered along the cross and main axis. If youre not sure what those are, check out the alignment section at CSS Flexbox Fundamentals Visual Guide.
.note-display {
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 margin: 0 25px;
}
Lets apply a stroke to the circles by setting the rules stroke-width, stroke-opacity and stroke-linecap that altogether style the stroke live ends. Next, lets add a color to each circle:
.circle__progress {
 fill: none;
 stroke-width: 3;
 stroke-opacity: 0.3;
 stroke-linecap: round;
}
.note-display:nth-child(1) .circle__progress { stroke: #AAFF00; }
.note-display:nth-child(2) .circle__progress { stroke: #FF00AA; }
.note-display:nth-child(3) .circle__progress { stroke: #AA00FF; }
.note-display:nth-child(4) .circle__progress { stroke: #00AAFF; }
In order to position the percent element absolutely, its necessary to know absolutely to what. The .circle element should be the reference, so lets add position: relative to it.
Note: For a deeper, visual explanation on absolute positioning, please read How To Understand CSS Position Absolute Once And For All.
Another way of centering elements is to combine top: 50%, left: 50% and transform: translate(-50%, -50%); which position the elements center at its parents center.
.circle {
 position: relative;
}
.percent {
 width: 100%;
 top: 50%;
 left: 50%;
 position: absolute;
 font-weight: bold;
 text-align: center;
 line-height: 28px;
 transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
.percent__int { font-size: 28px; }
.percent__dec { font-size: 12px; }
.label {
 font-family: 'Raleway', serif;
 font-size: 14px;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 margin-top: 15px;
}
By now, the template should be looking like this:
Finished template elements and styles (Large preview)
Fill Transition
The circle animation can be created with the help of two circle SVG properties: stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset.
stroke-dasharray defines the dash-gap pattern in a stroke.
It can take up to four values:
When its set to an only integer (stroke-dasharray: 10), dashes and gaps have the same size;
For two values (stroke-dasharray: 10 5), the first is applied to dashes, second to gaps;
The third and forth forms (stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 and stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 3) will generate dashes and gaps in various sizes.
stroke-dasharray property values (Large preview)
The image to the left shows the property stroke-dasharray being set from 0 to 238px, which is the circle circumference length.
The second image represents the stroke-dashoffset property that offsets the beginning of the dash array. It is also set from 0 to the circle circumference length.
stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset
 properties (Large preview)
To produce the filling effect, we will set the stroke-dasharray to the circumference length, so that all of its length gets filled with a big dash and no gap. Well also offset it by the same value, so it gets hidden. Then the stroke-dashoffset will be updated to the corresponding note value, filling the stroke accordingly to the transition duration.
The properties updating will be done in the scripts through CSS Variables. Lets declare the variables and set the properties:
.circle__progress--fill {
 --initialStroke: 0;
 --transitionDuration: 0;
 stroke-opacity: 1;
 stroke-dasharray: var(--initialStroke);
 stroke-dashoffset: var(--initialStroke);
 transition: stroke-dashoffset var(--transitionDuration) ease;
}
In order to set the initial value and update the variables, lets start by selecting all .note-display elements with document.querySelectorAll. The transitionDuration will be set to 900 milliseconds.
Then, we iterate through the displays array, select its .circle__progress.circle__progress--fill and extract the r attribute set in the HTML to calculate the circumference length. With that, we can set the initial --dasharray and --dashoffset values.
The animation will occur when the --dashoffset variable gets updated by a 100ms setTimeout:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
 progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = 50, 100);
});
To get the transition starting from the top, the .circle__svg element has to be rotated:
.circle__svg {
 transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
Stroke properties transition (Large preview)
Now, lets calculate the dashoffset value — relative to the note. The note value will be inserted to each li item through the data-* attribute. The * can be switched for any name that suits your needs and it can then, be retrieved in JavaScript through the elements dataset: element.dataset.*.
Note: You can read more about the data-* attribute on MDN Web Docs.
Our attribute will be called data-note:
&lt;ul class=""display-container""&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""7.50""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;

 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Reasonable&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""6.93""&gt;

 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Usable&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""8.72""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Exemplary&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The parseFloat method will convert the string returned by display.dataset.note into a floating point number. The offset represents the percentage missing to reach the maximum score. So, for a 7.50 note, we would have (10 - 7.50) / 10 = 0.25, which means the circumference length should be offset by 25% of its value:
let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
Updating the scripts.js:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
 progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
});
Stroke properties transition up to note value (Large preview)
Before we move on, lets extract the stoke transition to its own method:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
- let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
- let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
- let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
- let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
- progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
- progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
- setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ strokeTransition(display, note);
});
+ function strokeTransition(display, note) {
+ let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
+ let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
+ let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
+ progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
+ progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ }
Note Value Increase
There is still the note transition from 0.00 to the note value to be built. The first thing to do is to separate the integer and decimal values. We will use the string method split() (it takes an argument that determines where the string will be broken and returns an array containing both broken strings). Those will be converted to numbers and passed as arguments to the increaseNumber() function, along with the display element and a flag indicating if its an integer or a decimal.
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let [int, dec] = display.dataset.note.split('.');
+ [int, dec] = [Number(int), Number(dec)];
strokeTransition(display, note);
+ increaseNumber(display, int, 'int');
+ increaseNumber(display, dec, 'dec');
});
In the increaseNumber() function, we select either the .percent__int or .percent__dec element, depending on the className, and also in case the output should contain a decimal point or not. Weve set our transitionDuration to 900ms. Now, to animate a number from 0 to 7, for example, the duration has to be divided by the note 900 / 7 = 128.57ms. The result represents how long each increase iteration will take. This means our setInterval will fire every 128.57ms.
With those variables set, lets define the setInterval. The counter variable will be appended to the element as text and increased on each iteration:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
 element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Infinite counter increase (Large preview)
Cool! It does increase the values, but it kind of does it forever. We need to clear the setInterval when the notes achieve the value we want. That is done with clearInterval function:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
+ if (counter === number) { window.clearInterval(increaseInterval); }
element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Finished project (Large preview)
Now the number is updated up to the note value and cleared with clearInterval() function.

Sean Gallagher,"Enlarge / U-35 under construction at Kiel in 2013. The sub—like all the others in Germany's fleet—is currently in for repairs. reader comments 5 Germany has a submarine problem. During a test dive in October, the Deutsche Marine's U-35 struck something (probably a rock) with one of its four ""X-rudders,"" the steering planes on its rear fins. The damage required the submarine to be towed back to a shipyard in Kiel for repairs—where it joined three other German navy submarines currently drydocked. The U-35 was the Deutsche Marine's only working submarine prior to the collision. The remainder of the German submarine fleet is in port at the German naval base in Eckernförde—waiting for dry docks in Kiel to open up. Germany has a total of six submarines, all of the Type 212 class. These ""hybrid"" subs—also operated by the Italian navy—are powered by a combination of a diesel engine and nine proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. They are among the quietest, most advanced non-nuclear submarines in the world. Because their fuel cells are "" air independent propulsion "" (AIP), these subs can operate submerged for weeks without surfacing. And since the PEM cell ""engines"" have no moving parts other than the electrically powered screws, they're incredibly stealthy when submerged. They can also operate in waters as shallow as 17 meters deep (55 feet), making them ideal for patrolling the waters of the Baltic. But because of backlogs in repairs and a series of unfortunate events, only two of the Type 212 class are not currently under repairs—and they are not ready for active service: U-31, the class leader—launched in 2002—has just come out of major maintenance and has a year's worth of trials ahead of it before being returned to service. It has been out of service since 2014. U-32 had a battery casualty on a trip to Norway. U-33 is in the Kiel shipyard for maintenance until February of 2018 and will likely not be back in service until May or June. U-34 is due to start a yard period in Kiel in January, and it's not certain when it will return to service. U-36, the latest submarine built for the Deutsche Marine, was completed a year ago, but it is still in acceptance trials and is not expected to be fully active until May of 2018. The reason for the backlog: a spare-parts shortage that was exacerbated by cuts made to the Deutsche Marine's budget. To save money, the service stopped stockpiling spares for the complex systems of its subs, relying instead on either purchasing parts on demand or cannibalizing subs that were out of service—much like the US Navy has had to do as a result of budget sequestration over the past four years. As a result, Germany's entire submarine service is left essentially sitting on its hands through at least the first half of 2018.","Spare parts shortage, collision damage have sidelined entire sub fleet.",2017-12-19T20:25:33Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Das boot ist kaputt: German navy has zero working subs,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/das-boot-ist-kaputt-german-navy-has-zero-working-subs/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kiel_HWDW_U35-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-5,1

Victoria Song,"Its simple folks: Dont sit on your phone. Or do, and end up like an Ohio man who claims his three-week-old iPhone XS Max exploded and set his rear ablaze.
The man, who only wishes to be known as J. Hillard, told iDrop News that he noticed a strange smell coming from his phone in his rear pants pocket, followed by heat, and a burning sensation on his skin. Left no other option, I had to exit the room since there was a female in the break room with me and remove my pants, Hillard told iDrop News. I ran to the boardroom where I got my shoes and pants off as fast as possible. A VP of our company put the fire out with a fire extinguisher because he heard me yelling.
While its fair to say expensive smartphones shouldnt explode, you should also learn from Hillards example and not sit on your phone. These batteries are sensitive to overheating, your butt is warm, and sitting on them can exert pressure that isnt good for the battery. Hillard isnt even the first dude to deal with a phone exploding on his butt. Theres this student whose phone blew up during gym class, and this Seattle man. What did they all have in common? Theyre men who put their phones in their rear pockets.
Which brings us to realization of the one thing womens jeans are good for: You can stick a smartphone in a rear pocket AND not end up sitting on it. Womens back jean pockets are situated so high up as to be on the lower back, rather than actual butt. Whereas men can boast ample front and rear pockets in their pants, womens jeans generally only have two useful ones in the back. (The front ones are glorified denim mittens that you can only stick three fingers, knuckle deep in.)
And even if we wanted to, women cant stick these increasingly ginormous phones in the front pocket. Theyre so shallow, phones just slide out and clatter onto the floor anytime you sit. This handy visual by The Pudding shows just how only 40 percent of womens front pockets can fit an iPhone X, while 100 percent of mens front pockets can. The number falls to 20 percent for the Samsung Galaxy, and just 5 percent for the Google Pixel.
So really, this PSA is for men. Make use of your roomy front pockets. Stop putting phones in your rear pocket unless you want the VP of your company to extinguish your flaming butt. Or, you know, invest in this very fetching phone holster.

Al Williams,"The first thing I ever built without a kit was a 5 V regulated power supply using the old LM390K. That’s a classic linear regulator like a 7805. While they are simple, they waste a lot of energy as heat, especially if the input voltage goes higher. While there are still applications where linear regulators make sense, they are increasingly being replaced by switching power supplies that are much more efficient. How do switchers work? Well, you buy a switching power supply IC, add an inductor and you are done. Class dismissed. Oh wait… while that might be the best way to do it from a cost perspective, you don’t really learn a lot that way. In this installment of Circuit VR, we’ll look at a simple buck converter — that is a switching regulator that takes a higher voltage and produces a lower voltage. The first one won’t actually regulate, mind you, but we’ll add that in a future installment. As usual for Circuit VR, we’ll be simulating the designs using LT Spice. Interestingly, LT Spice is made to design power supplies so it has a lot of Linear Technology parts in its library just for that purpose. However, we aren’t going to use anything more sophisticated than an op amp. For the first pass, we won’t even be using those. How’s it Work? Inductors and capacitors are energy storage devices. In particular, an inductor stores energy as a magnetic field and responds to the change in the current through it. The idea behind a switching buck converter is to pulse width modulate the current to an inductor so that it produces the desired voltage. You’ll also want a capacitor at the output and you need a way to shunt negative voltages caused by reverse current flow to ground such as a Schottky diode. A typical architecture looks like this: You can find the whole thing on GitHub. Notice that here, I’m using a Spice voltage source for the input voltage and a pulse generator to create PWM. You can set the period with parameter T and the duty cycle with parameter D. I didn’t do a lot of logic picking components here. I pretended I was digging through my junk box and grabbed the first things that seemed like they’d work. If you want to maximize efficiency or minimize startup time or optimize anything else, you probably should work smarter than that. The frequency I picked was arbitrary — about 333 kHz. Again, I just wanted a circuit you could experiment with and we’ll build the rest of the circuit around this core. If you experiment a bit with changing D, you can probably intuit a great deal of what the mathematical analysis will tell you. Over at least some range of operation, the voltage out will be roughly the voltage in multiplied by the duty cycle. If you want a 5 V output with 15 V in and your diode and other components are perfect, the duty cycle is 1/3. Of course, your diode will have some drop and the other components have parasitic elements, so the reality is it will be a little off at 1/3. Try changing the diode model to ideal and see how that affects things, or try a silicon diode. You can see I have 0.31 and that gets pretty close. Try removing the diode. You’ll see the voltage at the transistor’s source will go negative. You’ll see what effect varying the inductance value has in a bit. Try changing the capacitor’s value and note the effect — especially on startup time. This is one of those cases, too, where the capacitor’s ESR (effective series resistance) has a major effect on circuit operation. If you right-click the capacitor, you can add a little ESR. Try 1 Ω — high for a ceramic capacitor but not so high for an electrolytic — and note the effect it has. At first, you might think it doesn’t have much effect, but zoom in on the output voltage once it is stable. You’ll see the ESR adds ripple to the output. The green trace is 0.01 Ω, the blue is 0.1 Ω, and the red is 1 Ω. Of course, the inductor and capacitor also form a resonant circuit which can interact with the PWM frequency, but for now, I am literally just “junk boxing” the circuit so we’ll skip the math. The frequency of the components shown is just under 2 kHz. Try setting the T parameter to 1m (1 kHz) and see what happens. One of the nice things about this circuit is the transistor is either on or off. Since a MOSFET will probably have a very low on resistance it won’t dissipate much power. This allows switchers to operate much more efficiently than using a pass transistor as in a normal linear power supply. Of course, the switch doesn’t have to be a FET, but FETs work so well that it is rare to see anything else used in a modern design. However, this does mean low on resistance is important for efficient operation. Note I am driving the gate at a higher voltage than the supply voltage because I wanted the maximum Vgs for this device. This isn’t always necessary but since the source voltage will be roughly the drain voltage at some point, it is a good idea or else efficiency will suffer or the converter may not work. In real life, the difference might not be as great as I use here — maybe a diode drop or two, if any. Again, this is just to get a feel for the circuit. In the final design, we probably want some resistors to snub any high frequency oscillations and take care of some other practical concerns. We could make changes to increase stability, efficiency, size — but probably not all of them at once. For example, adding a snubber has advantages, but will decrease efficiency. But for now, this will get us started. Modes Notice when I was talking about duty cycle setting the output voltage that I said “at least some range of operation?” It turns out there are two different regimes this circuit can operate in. In one, the current in the inductor will fall to zero at some point. This is discontinuous mode and is harder to handle because almost every component will play a part in determining the output voltage. However, if the inductor current does not go to zero, the output is purely a function of the duty cycle. That’s generally the mode you want, so you’ll want a larger inductor. Right now, the inductor is 1 mH and the inductor current stays between 5 and 15 mA if you let it stabilize. Try, say, a 50 μH inductor. Here are some plots showing output voltage with inductors ranging from 50 μH to 100 mH. You can see the lower value inductors are not in the operating regime we want. Why Stop? A lot of tutorials will stop here. The problem is, this isn’t a regulator. If the input voltage goes to, say, 10V, what happens? Or 20V? The problem is the 1/3 PWM duty cycle only works for 15 V. What you want is a servo loop that compares the output voltage to some reference and generates PWM based on the difference. That doesn’t make sense at first. To make a 5 V supply I need to compare it to a 5 V reference? There are two things to consider. First, it is relatively simple to make a precise voltage reference that can’t handle a lot of power. For example, a diode or LED drop is pretty constant over a wide range. A Zener diode can work too but isn’t good for power applications. You can make a low-current reference voltage much easier than a power regulator. The other trick is to use a voltage divider to sample the output voltage. So maybe your 5 V output produces 1.4 V after the divider and you compare it to two diode drops. Now it makes more sense. The answer, then, is to figure out how far the voltage is from what you want. Then you can create a PWM signal to control how often to turn on the gate of the transistor. If the output voltage is OK, you don’t need to do anything. If it isn’t on target, though, you need to change the PWM drive. Block diagram-wise: The converter is just the part we saw earlier. The divider is optional but should get the expected output (5V in this case) down to the reference voltage, whatever that is. The output of the differential amplifier is the error voltage that mixes with a triangle wave in the comparator to generate the PWM at the correct duty cycle. PWM? If you are wondering how a triangle wave and a comparator generates PWM, this picture should clear it up: The black is the triangle wave, of course. The yellow dashed line is the error voltage. The comparator output (red) turns on when the triangle is higher than the error voltage. In the top trace, the error is about midway so the output duty cycle is about 50%. In the bottom trace, the higher voltage creates a lower duty cycle. If you need to reverse the action you can do that by flipping the comparator (or flip your monitor; we’ll wait). That is if the comparator goes low when the error voltage is higher than the triangle wave, that will have the effect of inverting the red square wave making the duty cycle inverted. Now, this raises another question: how do you generate a triangle wave? There are a few ways to do that. The classic way is to take a square wave that goes from positive to negative and integrate it. You can also take advantage of the fact that a constant current source will charge a capacitor in a straight line. A constant current sink will discharge it the same way. You can see why an integrated solution is popular. Having the closed loop control not only provides regulation for changes in input voltage, but also — if the reference is good — for variations in components, temperature, and load currents. However, the circuitry does get a little complex. Keep in mind, too, I’m trying to make a quick and dirty simple version. There are all sorts of tricks people use to get better performance — depending on how you define performance — and I’m ignoring all of those, at least for now. But that makes the complexity even greater. Also, this is just one topology. Some buck converters will use two FETs. Some will reduce switching frequency based on load. Then there are boost topologies for going from a lower voltage to a higher one and even boost-buck when you just can’t decide. We will flesh out the design more next time. We’ll eventually get to a buck converter that regulates.","The first thing I ever built without a kit was a 5 V regulated power supply using the old LM390K.

Chaim Gartenberg,"As is practically tradition, HMD Global has come to Mobile World Congress with a new lineup of Nokia phones, and this years group includes budget devices with some clever new features.
That starts with the Nokia 4.2, a new class of phone for the company designed to slot in between the pricier Nokia 5 line and the cheaper Nokia 3. The 4.2 is meant to offer an affordable flagship experience, with premium features like a notched 5.71-inch display, glass front and back design, dual camera system, and a fingerprint sensor without breaking the $200 mark.
The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 processor, so its definitely not the fastest device around. Its rounded out by a 3,000 mAh battery and either 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage or 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage. 
But the most interesting part of the Nokia 4 is its buttons. Theres a dedicated Google Assistant button, which Nokia is loading with a few tricks: press it once to trigger the Assistant, twice to bring up Googles Visual Snapshot view, and press and hold to keep the mic open for a conversational, always listening mode like on a full smart speaker. 
Theres also a breathing notification light integrated into the power button. If the device is face down, the light will gently glow when you have new notifications, which is a clever feature. The Nokia 4 will cost either $169 or $199 depending on the storage configuration, although Nokia isnt sure yet which configurations will come to the US when the phone launches in April. 
Nokia 3.2
Next is the Nokia 3.2, an updated version of the 3.1 thats getting the same dedicated Google Assistant and glowing power buttons, a larger 6.26-inch notched display, and a beefy 4,000 mAh battery. 
The 3.2 has the same Snapdragon 439 processor and 2GB RAM / 16GB storage and 3GB RAM / 32GB storage options as the 4.2. But the 3.2 does lack a few of the 4.2s nicer features, like the glass back (its plastic, instead) and the fingerprint sensor. It is a bit cheaper though, set to cost $169 and $139, depending on the storage/RAM option. Like the Nokia 4.2, the Nokia 3.2 will also launch in April. 
Nokia 1
HMD is also announcing the $99 Nokia 1 Plus, which is meant to improve upon last years Nokia 1 as a sort of entry-level smartphone for folks looking to upgrade from a feature phone for the first time. 
It features a 5.45-inch 18:9 display, removable back cover with replaceable battery, and is thinner than last years model. Crucially, itll also run Android 9 Pie Go, instead of the larger Android 9 Pie, and will be available in early March.
Nokia 210
Lastly, theres the Nokia 210, a proper, classic Nokia feature phone. As you might expect, the specs here are nothing to be amazed by: a 2.4-inch QVGA display and 16MB of memory. But, it also does have Snake, physical keys, a removable 1,020mAh battery, an FM radio, and even an app store (for apps designed for Nokias proprietary, Java-based feature phone OS). Itll cost $35 when it comes out later this year.","As is practically tradition, HMD Global is at MWC 2019 with a new lineup of its Nokia phones, spanning the range from budget Android options to featurephones that are designed to offer new options along the company’s entire range.",2019-02-24T15:30:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Nokia bets big on buttons with its new budget phones,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18236618/nokia-4-3-1-plus-210-buttons-google-assistant-mwc-2019,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkHBj4MrmrUtyaSdIig3Rm0viJI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130573/bfarsace_190210_3229_0029.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-5,1
Kartik Hosanagar,"One fine summer morning, you show up for a scheduled appointment for your regular checkup at the highly rated local health clinic. You walk in feeling fine. You raise your arm and say, Doc, it hurts when I do this. The doctor responds, Then dont do that. You both chuckle. But several tests later, your mood changes. Your internist, friendly old Dr. Culverton Smith, has some bad news.
Im afraid youre at high risk for Tapanuli fever, Dr. Smith says. Its inevitably fatal. The good news is that theres a medication that can help prevent it. I recommend you start taking it immediately. It may make you light-headed, irritable, and occasionally nauseous. But thats a small price to pay to avoid the fever.
You are taken aback. Ive never heard of this disease, you protest as he scribbles out a prescription. How do you know Im at risk for it?
Excerpted from A HUMANS GUIDE TO MACHINE INTELLIGENCE. by Kartik Hosanagar
Dr. Smith shows you a computer printout filled with incomprehensible numbers and terms. But he points to a line near the bottom of the form that reads: TAPANULI FEVER: 17.88. That risk factors way too high, he explains. We want to get it down below 5. The pills should help.
But where did that number come from? you ask.
Dr. Smith shrugs. Its our new AI system. Its all the rage these days. The software has the knowledge of a thousand top diagnosticians built into it. Not much point in questioning what it has to saynot if you want to stay alive, that is.
You take the prescription and leave. But on the drive home, you cant decide whether to stop at the pharmacy. You believe in technology and the marvels of machine learning. But do you really want to put up with light-headedness, irritability, and nausea to fend off the possibility of some unknown disease just because Dr. Smiths computer software says you should? When it comes right down to it, do you trust the algorithm?
If your answer is no, you might want to reflect on the reasons why.
A big part of the problem may be the vagueness of the doctors explanation. What if, in answer to your question, Where did that number come from? he had replied, Your blood test this afternoon shows you have unusually low levels of three proteins that help bolster your immune defenses against Tapanuli fever. And the genome analysis we did last fall had already indicated a heightened vulnerability to several syndromes associated with Southeast Asian ancestry. A study in The New Jersey Journal of Medicine found that this combination of traits leads to a 94 percent increase in incidence of Tapanuli fever. The software puts all this data together and calculates your risk factorthe number I showed you on your printout. Hearing those details, youd probably find the case for medication more compelling, even if you didnt really understand everything the doctor said.
Of course, this story is fabricated, and the disease is fictitious. (Tapanuli fever appears in The Adventure of the Dying Detective, a Sherlock Holmes short story written in 1913 by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. ) But because software employing AI is now being used to diagnose illnesses and calculate risk factors for various conditions, the question of what it takes for patientsand physiciansto trust an algorithm regarding matters of sickness and health is a real one. And it is transparency, research suggests, that is the key to understanding, acceptance, and belief. Let people look inside the black box of the algorithm, the thinking goes, and their mistrust, hostility, and fear will gradually melt away.
That argument sounds logical enough. But is it true? Is transparency the major factor in fostering trust in algorithms? As with so much in this area, the answer is interesting and complicated.
Clifford Nass had a problem. Students in his popular Stanford University class on technology interface design were complaining about their grades on the midterm exam. While such complaints are all too common for professors, the complaints had a specific, substantive basis in this case. Students in one section of the course had discovered that they were receiving significantly lower exam grades than their counterparts in another section, even when their essay responses were similar.
The cause of the problem wasnt hard to identify. Two different teaching assistants had graded the papers. Since the scoring of essay responses is inherently subjective, its not surprising that TAs differ in their grading. One way to minimize this problem is to assign specific TAs to grade specific test questions for the entire group of students. In this system, any two students comparing their grades for a given question can feel that grading is fair because the same TA read both the answers. But Nass had chosen not to follow this procedure. Because there were more than 200 students in the class but only two questions on the midterm, Nass had divided the grading among TAs by class section. This simple, efficient decision introduced a fatal element of bias, and unleashed justifiable dissent from his students.
Nass could simply have backed down, apologized, and adopted the divide-by-question system for future exams. But as a leading expert on human-computer interactions, he instead saw an opportunity for a statistical solution. Using an idea suggested by one of his TAs, Nass decided to fix the grading bias by creating an algorithm.
Nass and a research assistant worked together to measure the grading tendencies of each TA based on his or her scoring of similar problem sets. They then created a simple statistical model to adjust student scores to counteract the individual scoring biasesfor example, by raising grades by 5 percent on papers scored by a TA known to give grades 5 percent lower than average.
Nass was confident that his students would be pleased. He sent them emails containing both their original grades and adjusted grades based on his simple algorithm. In the spirit of openness, he also carefully explained the details of his adjustment algorithm and how it ensured the greatest possible fairness.
Nass was startled when the students responded with further complaintssome even angrier than the initial ones.
Something had clearly gone wrong.
At the heart of this conundrum are the tangled vines of transparency and trust. When we interact with algorithms, we know we are dealing with machines. Yet somehow their intelligence and their ability to mimic our own patterns of thought and communication confuse us into viewing them as human. Researchers have observed that when computer users are asked to describe how machines interact with them, they use anthropomorphic terms such as integrity, honesty, and cruelty. I also refer to algorithms behavior or their going rogue. Our language, at least, would suggest that we expect the same degree of trustworthiness, benevolence, and fairness from the computer algorithms we deal with as we do from our human peers.
This helps to explain why harnessing the power of transparency to induce greater trust in algorithms is more difficult than one might assume. The complications with transparency in general, and Nasss unsuccessful foray into grading transparency in particular, can be seen in massive open online courses, better known as MOOCs. Unconstrained by factors such as student location or classroom size, universities, colleges, and educational platforms such as Coursera offer online classes that can be taken by tens of thousands of students. For example, the entrepreneurship courses that I have taught on Coursera have been taken by nearly 100,000 students (as compared to roughly 2,500 students over the course of 15 years in brick-and-mortar university classrooms). The reach of MOOCs is great, but they have their own challengesfor example, how to actively engage the many students with whom you dont interact, or how to grade complex assignments such as essays or designs turned in by a class numbering more than 10,000. Most MOOCs use peer grading rather than having TAs score student papers: In other words, the students are asked to evaluate one anothers work. The notion might sound odd at first, but studies have shown that peer grading is actually comparable to grading by an instructor. Anonymous peer grading bolsters the accuracy of the scores by reducing favoritism and other such concerns as well as eliminating the need to hire hundreds of graders for each course. However, it does not do away with the problem of grader biasin fact, it intensifies it, because it involves many more graders with varying personalities and tendencies.
René Kizilcec, a young Stanford PhD student, wanted to solve this grader bias issue. His interest was not accidental. Nass was in fact his adviser, and he had watched the turmoil unfold in the class. When he enrolled as Nasss PhD student, Kizilcec had planned to work on the development of trust-inducing interfaces for semi-autonomous vehicles. But in November 2013, tragedy struck when the 55-year-old Nass suffered a heart attack and died. Left without his admired adviser, Kizilcec found himself thinking more and more about the grading problem that Nass had left unsolved.
Kizilcec found that many of the MOOCs were using variants of a grade-adjustment algorithm created by one of Kizilcecs colleagues. Interestingly, none of the MOOCs explained this grading policy to their students. The MOOC managers were unsure of the wisdom of communicating to students how their grades were determined, and, even if they did, how to do so effectively. For the students, the stakes were high, because the grades determined whether or not they received a certificate for completing the course.
Kizilcec set out to create an online version of Nass original experiment with algorithmically adjusted gradesand to use it to test how transparency could ultimately change the degree of trust that students would have in the algorithms that affected them. He began with a group of 103 students who had submitted essays to be peer graded. Each essay was graded by multiple peers. Kizilcec asked these students to state the grade they expected to receive. Next, each student received both a combined gradea simple average of the grades assigned by a group of peer gradersand a computed grade, one adjusted by an algorithm that accounted for each graders bias.
To test the effect of transparency upon trust, Kizilcec varied the amount of information each student received about the grading process. One set of students was provided minimal transparency about the workings of the algorithm and was simply informed of the computed grade.
A second subset of students was given an entire paragraph explaining how the grades were adjusted by a simple algorithm: Your computed grade is X, which is based on the grades you received from your peers and adjusted for their bias and accuracy in grading. The accuracy and bias are estimated using a statistical procedure that employs an expectation maximization algorithm with a prior for class grades. This adjusts your grade for easy/harsh graders and grader proficiency.
Immediately after receiving this information, participants were asked several questions to assess their trust in the peer grading system. The questions dealt with comprehension of the process (To what extent do you understand how your grade is computed in peer grading?) as well as perceived fairness, accuracy, and finally, trust.
Based on their original anticipated grades and their final grades, Kizilcec sorted the students into two groups: those who had received a grade similar to expectations, and those who had suffered an expectation violationthat is, they received a lower grade than they had anticipated. The attitudes of the two groups toward grading transparency proved to be dramatically different. For students whose grade expectations had been met or exceeded, the level of transparency did not affect their levels of trust. But for those who had received an unpleasant surprise, the level of trust was strongly linked to the transparency level. The disappointed students who had been given more information about the grading procedurethe second, greater transparency conditionrated their trust in the grading system higher than those who had received the bare-bones explanation.
Kizilcec explained this result by referring to a human tendency to apply greater scrutiny to information when expectations are violated, and the idea that people are often satisfied with a system, even when faced with a negative or disappointing result, as long as they believe that the underlying process is fair. A grading algorithm is an attempt to adjust for biases and inaccuracies. We agree that is the right thing to do even if the outcome might be negative for us even if [our] grade is adjusted down, says Kizilcec. That meant that even students who received poor grades were willing to trust the system if the information they got about the process assured them that every effort had been made to ensure that the grades were fair.
Where, then, had Nass gone wrong? Why didnt his in-depth explanation of the grading algorithm win students trust and quell their complaints?
The answer is provided by another aspect of Kizilcecs experiment. In fact, Kizilcec tested not two tiers of transparency but three. The two levels mentioned above were labeled low and medium. A third set of students received not only the paragraph of explanation from the medium level, but also their individual raw peer-graded scores, along with details on how exactly these raw scores were combined and adjusted to arrive at the final grade. This was labeled high transparency.
And here is where the experimental results contained a surprise. Among students with violated expectations, the medium transparency level increased trust relative to the low level. But those who experienced the high transparency level did not, as you might expect, experience an even greater sense of trust in the algorithm. Instead, they reported even less trust than those in the low transparency group!
What did this all mean?
The results stem, Kizilcec argues, from our tendency to anthropomorphize machines, and from the social rules and heuristics we employ in human interactions. When we meet new people, we are hesitant to develop close ties of trust and friendship with them until we see some evidence that they are honest and forthright. We expect a degree of transparency from others, and we distrust those who withhold, so we tend to avoid people who conceal their thoughts and intentions. Kizilcec points out that many of us also find it difficult to like and trust people who are excessively transparent. Those who spend too much time explaining and justifying their intentions often arouse our suspicions, to the point that we start to wonder, What is he trying to prove?
For human beings, then, there is such a thing as the right amount of transparencynot too little, not too much. Kizilcec argues that the same applies to algorithms. Too much information can undermine user trust as much as too little. Kizilcec believesand has peer-reviewed reason to believethat there is a similar sweet spot for trust in human-algorithm interactions.
We now have a basis to understand where Clifford Nass went wrong. Nass informed his students how their newly adjusted grades had been computed, his goal being to gain their trust through algorithmic transparency. But Nass actually over-explained the algorithm. In two lengthy emails, he detailed the precise methods used to calculate the grades. In one instance, he wrote: With those data in hand, we can now compute your Midterm Q1 adjusted. The formula is: Midterm Q1 Adjusted = ((Mid- term Q1 number wrongMedian FOR YOUR GRADER)/ (.5*interquartile range FOR YOUR GRADER))+4. This explanation was followed by even more specific calculations using hypothetical graders and scores.
Nass would probably have won over his students if hed provided them with just enough information to convince them that the grade adjustment procedure was fairand stopped there. By offering such a highly detailed explanation, he triggered a trust backlash. Perhaps the bewildering level of detail they were given inadvertently shifted the students focus from the fairness of the process back to their unfavorable grades or to their lack of understanding of the actual procedure, thereby undoing whatever gains in trust he had hoped to achieve.
To use the modern expression, it was a case of TMItoo much information.

"Doug Criss, CNN","(CNN) Good Monday morning. Congress is back in session today, and here are 5 things it could do on gun reform. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Florida high school shooting Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School return to class this week, as the gun debate ignited by the mass shooting there rages on. More than a dozen business backed away from the NRA over its response to the shooting. President Trump -- who says he'll support stricter background checks and age requirements for gun purchases -- plans to talk to the nation's governors about it today when they get together at the White House. There's growing pressure on Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel to resign after several of his deputies failed to engage shooter Nikolas Cruz during the massacre. And everyone is dumbfounded at the stunning number of red flags about Cruz that were missed. The bombing of Eastern Ghouta continues despite a new UN ceasefire OK'd over the weekend. Doctors in the beseiged Damascus suburb say the ceasefire is just ""ink on paper"" that's done nothing to stop the barbaric deaths being inflicted upon the people there. And the violence is about to get worse, as there are now reports of ground attacks on Eastern Ghouta, one of the last rebel strongholds in the country. The Syrian regime claims it's targeting terrorists and will continue to do so despite the ceasefire. The Democrats' (redacted) memo on alleged FBI abuses is finally out. It tries to undercut the previously released GOP memo on two main points. First, it says the FBI did let a court know of the Democratic ties to the infamous Trump dossier when the agency used it in asking for a warrant to conduct surveillance on Trump associate Carter Page. Second, the memo argues the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election didn't start with the dossier; it had already been going on for weeks. President Trump dismissed the Dems' memo as a ""politically driven document."" Will the age of the emperors make a comeback in China? The question's coming up after the country's Communist Party proposed dumping presidential term limits so that President Xi Jinping can serve a third term -- and perhaps run the country indefinitely. But many observers see the move as a sign of weakness, as Xi is apparently afraid of the rise of a political rival. There's fear too that this could push the world's most populous country into a period of extreme instablity. The Games are over in PyeongChang, but the memories will last forever. The two and a half weeks of figure skating, skiing, ice hockey and curling ended with a spectacular closing ceremony and calls for peace. Athletes from North and South Korea marched together again, and the South wants the US and the North to start talking. Norway set a medals record; the country won a mind-blowing 39. There will be lots of debate about Team USA's lackluster showing, but these Games will be best remembered for Chloe Kim and Ester Ledecka and North Korean cheerleaders and Yuzuru Hanyu and Jamaican women bobsledders.","Good Monday morning.

Nick Douglas,"There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability. You can learn it from college courses, books, online resources—or from one of several growing boot camps for developers of all ages. We talked to the founders of two such boot camps: David Graham of Code Ninjas, for kids 7–14, and Michael Choi of Coding Dojo, for teens and adults. They explained their different approaches, both of which give their students the ability to build their own applications. Michael Choi learned to code in Korea at age 12, with help from a friend who would make whole computer games in a day. When he went to college, he found their computer science classes didn’t address his needs. His Coding Dojo program trains students in just 14 weeks. “Our goal is, how can we get people to be a self-sufficient developer?” says Choi. In the first 3–4 weeks, students learn to “think like a computer” with five core concepts: if/else statements, for loops, functions, variables, and object-oriented programming. The next 10 weeks are spent on learning specific languages, and how each language handles those five concepts. This part isn’t just useful for students learning to code for the first time, but also for working developers who want to expand their career options. “They spend their entire career using one language, but now they need to pick something new,” says Choi. Coding Dojo can train a developer in a new language in 3–4 weeks, says Choi, versus 6–9 months learning on their own. But most of the work is done in assignments, not lectures. One reason college courses didn’t work for him is that they involved long lecture. “People only retain about 20 minutes of lecture,” he says, so he boils lessons down as much as possible, assigning 4–5 hours of work based on that lecture. When you’re just starting to learn to code, it’s hard to tell if you’ve got the basics down and if… Read more Read While Graham’s Code Ninjas follows the same principle of learning through building, it works on a much longer scale. The full curriculum lasts 3–4 years, and kids progress through it like a martial arts program, earning colored belts as they complete different levels. Students learn every concept by using it to build a video game. They can even draw their own art for the game. This makes the class feel less like another school subject and more like a fun project—learning to code becomes a game in itself. The kids make some wild games, with things like characters who fart rainbows. “That was not in our original curriculum!” says Graham. “Their imaginations are endless. I thought it would be kind of paint by numbers. What we found out is that kids don’t have those boundaries and walls in their thinking that adults do.” He’s convinced that Super Mario Brothers, where plumbers stomp on mushrooms and turtles, must have been influenced by kids. Graham staffs the school with high school seniors and college students, who can relate to the kids better than adults would. (He also points out that because coding jobs pay so well, he just can’t afford to hire adult coders.) Graham emphasizes that his curriculum teaches real coding—“any kid can whip something up from a template,” he says, but a Code Ninjas black belt can build an app for the App Store from scratch. Or could—Choi has the full curriculum planned out, but Code Ninjas only opened in March 2017, so his first students have only reached the intermediate phase. (Code Ninjas is rapidly expanding, and currently lists 264 locations in 32 states.) Changing career paths, getting an idea for an app out of your head, or just learning something new… Read more Read Graham and Choi agree that young people have an advantage when learning to code. Graham, who has also taught adults to code, says that kids move faster because they’re just more used to soaking up knowledge and following instructions. “Critical thinking isn’t bad, but it doesn’t lend itself to learning as quickly.” Choi says that younger students might have a “slightly easier” time, but his students range from 16 to their 60s. Of course, you can learn to code without a camp. You can still teach yourself, or start solo before moving onto a camp or other social method. Choi recommends the tutorials at W3Schools, and the online edX version of Harvard’s CS50 course. But he warns about the latter, “It goes pretty deep pretty quickly.”","There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"Republicans are forging ahead with their promise to overhaul the tax code, even with very little public support for their proposal. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) If any group has been convinced by the rhetoric of the Republican tax plan, it’s Republicans. That’s not surprising in one sense. Part of modern American politics is partisans supporting their team. The Republican team is pro-tax-bill, so more Republicans are pro-tax-bill. But in another sense, it is surprising: Despite that partisan loyalty, the tax plan isn’t overwhelmingly popular with Republicans, either. The selling points for the tax bill were that it would result in tax cuts for the middle class directly and benefits to the middle class indirectly by spurring economic growth and job creation from corporate tax cuts. That outside analyses plastered these assertions with various question marks and asterisks was generally ignored by Republican leaders. (For example, even after accounting for growth in the economy, the national debt is expected to grow over the next 10 years by $1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The JCT also estimates that most of the benefit from the cuts would go to wealthy Americans, and most businesses report that they plan to largely invest new cash in stockholders, not employees.) Republicans told pollsters from Quinnipiac University that they agreed with party leaders’ predictions. More than half said they expected the middle class to benefit most; less than a quarter said the wealthy would. Eighty-six percent figured the bill would lead to new jobs and economic growth. Fewer than 1 in 5 thought the bill favored the rich. Interestingly, 55 percent of Republicans figured that the middle class would benefit the most from the bill, while only 27 percent of the actual middle class agreed. Sixty percent of the middle class figured the wealthy would benefit more. Overall, views of the bill were less optimistic. Only 29 percent of Americans told Quinnipiac they approved of the tax bill, the same percentage that approved of the bill in polling from Gallup. The broader context for the bill is that it’s being advocated by a party and a president who themselves aren’t that popular. In August, Americans saw the parties as about even in their ability to handle taxes. In the new Quinnipiac poll, the Democrats gained an 8-point advantage, suggesting that the unpopularity of the bill was dragging down perceptions of the GOP. It’s so unpopular, in fact, that it’s less popular than Trump in both Quinnipiac’s and Gallup’s polls — even among Republicans. In Quinnipiac’s poll, Republicans viewed Trump 15 points more positively than they view the tax bill. In Gallup’s, Trump had an 8-point advantage among members of his own party. So, sure, the Republican rhetoric on the tax bill is echoed by Republican voters. But it’s also the case that fewer than three-quarters of Republicans support the bill in both of the new polls. Trump is relatively popular with his party — and his tax bill less so. This is for a bill that ostensibly cuts taxes. Yet it’s less popular than the most unpopular president in his first year in office in the modern era.","Washington Post Trump's tax plan is still even less popular than Trump Washington Post If any group has been convinced by the rhetoric of the Republican tax plan, it's Republicans.

Warren Qatar Airways will feature its award-winning new ""Qsuites"" business class on flights from Chicago starting on April 1. The airline also announced plans to roll out Qsuites on flights from Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The airline currently flies from 10 US cities — plus Las Vegas, later this year — and operates an extensive network throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with connections through Doha, Qatar. Qatar Airways just announced that its new ""Qsuite"" business class product, which was first announced last year, will soon be available on the airline's daily flight from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The airline also announced that it would be replacing the equipment on its flights from Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles later this year. Qsuites will be available on Chicago flights starting on April 1. Qatar hasn't announced timing or other details for Houston, Dallas, or Los Angeles. While rumors have been circulating that Qatar planned to launch Qsuites from Chicago for several weeks, since travel blog One Mile At A Time noticed that the available seat maps on Chicago flights had changed, this is the first time the airline has confirmed the service's Midwest expansion. Qatar Airways won awards in 2017 for best airline and best overall business class from Skytrax, the authoritative airline review and ranking consultancy group. While its older business class product is still comfortable and features fantastic service, Qsuites is a redefinition of business class as ""first class lite."" The new product, which features fully enclosed ""suites"" in the air with seats that can fold into flat beds, and even combine into double-beds in the middle aisle, should be rolled out through Qatar's entire fleet of long-haul aircraft within two years, according to Qatar Airways vice president for the Americas Gunter Saurwein. Until then, it will be launched on one route at a time. Currently, Qatar's New York City and Washington, DC routes feature aircraft equipped with Qsuites. There are 10 US cities that are currently serviced by Qatar Airways : Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. It's also announced plans to launch a route to Las Vegas later this year. Because Qatar is a member of the Oneworld airline alliance, you can book connecting flights on Oneworld partner American Airlines, or non-alliance codeshare partner JetBlue, as part of the same itinerary. Qatar offers routes to around 150 destinations, with connections through its airport hub in Doha, Qatar. Routes throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Africa are all compelling for US-based travelers. I recently had a chance to tour a Qatar Airways 777-300ER plane while it was parked at New York's JFK airport in between trips. I was able to test the seats and the in-flight entertainment, explore the business class and economy cabins, and sample the business class catering and amenities, as well as interact with the cabin crew that would be working on the flight later that evening. While this was a staged media event, which is obviously different than actually flying the airline, it became clear why Qatar won Skytrax's 2017 top honors.

Nicole Gallucci,"You might think we left the '90s far, far behind us, but on this day in 2018 the world is once again called to turn its attention to Robert Matthew Van Winkle, the rapper best known by his stage name, Vanilla Ice. Now there's a good chance you're asking yourself, ""Why on earth is the 'Ice Ice Baby' artist relevant again?"" Did he drop some new music? Did Trump attempt to tweet his favorite flavor of ice cream and screw up!? Great guesses, but no! Vanilla Ice is currently in the news because this afternoon he claimed to be a passenger on a quarantined plane at New York's JFK Airport. And.... uh... naturally everyone wants to know if that's true. SEE ALSO: This flight-sharing service is like Uber Pool for private planes In order to unpack this bizarre and unexpected Vanilla Ice storyline, we invite you all to stop, collaborate, and listen to a breakdown. Early Wednesday morning, as many as 100 passengers on Emirates Flight 203 — which flew to JFK from Dubai — were reported ill, many suffering from a cough and fevers over 100 degrees. The plane, which was carrying 500 passengers, reportedly landed at 9:06 a.m. ET, and after a quarantine, 10 passengers and crew members in need of further medical attention were taken to a hospital. But the story didn't end there. At around 2:00 p.m. ET, semi-forgotten rapper (but still beloved whenever the musical nostalgia hits) Vanilla Ice tweeted that he too was stuck on a quarantined plane at JFK. Image: screengrab/tweetdeck But since the tweets came so long after the Emirates Flight 203 drama was first reported, and four hours after Emirates Airline tweeted a statement, the rapper's claims were a bit confusing. Image: screengrab/google Was Vanilla Ice really on a quarantined plane? ""So I just landed from Dubai and now there is like tons of ambulances and fire trucks and police all over the place,” Vanilla Ice tweeted, alongside a video taken from the window of a plane. He began a thread, sharing video of coverage of the Emirates Airbus A380 that had landed hours earlier, and tweeting, ""This is crazy. Apparently there is over 100 people sick on the bottom floor, so happy I’m up top, it’s a double decker plane 380."" This is crazy. Apparently there is over 100 people sick on the bottom floor, so happy I’m up top, it’s a double-decker plane 380 — Vanilla Ice (@vanillaice) September 5, 2018 Though Vanilla Ice could have definitely been tweeting live updates from the quarantined plane, some red flags — including the delayed timing of his tweets — definitely sprung up. A big point of confusion came when it was discovered Twitter user @Larry Coben had posted pictures from virtually the same angle as Vanilla Ice, only hours earlier. A theory was that Vanilla Ice was simply tweeting his updates late, but according to Dataminr location tracking, he was tweeting from JFK at around 2:00 p.m., so perhaps the de-boarding of the plane carried into the afternoon and Ice was detained a bit longer? While the world awaited answers, people couldn't pass up the opportunity to make some quality Vanilla Ice jokes. Vanilla Ice was on the Emirates plane from Dubai where a bunch of people got sick is an extremely good and true 2018 sentence https://t.co/tIrbJgrxrd — Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) September 5, 2018 The year was 2018, and it was a day just like any other. Kim Kardashian was visiting the White House and Vanilla Ice was stuck on a plane from Dubai filled with sick passengers. — Alexis Benveniste (@apbenven) September 5, 2018 Ice, this is a problem. I thought you said you'd solve it? — The Natural (@jacobstevens) September 5, 2018 And though we still await more concrete information on what happened with the plane passengers from a medical standpoint via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we do know Vanilla Ice is safe. In an exclusive interview with the Blast, a fresh-off-the-formerly-quarantined-plane Vanilla Ice said he ""didn’t think it was that big of a deal"" at first, and passengers were told during the flight some people were ill so they were going to the middle of the runway to ""hang out."" ""They sealed off the two floors and eventually removed first class at a separate entrance,"" Vanilla Ice said, explaining he was given a quick medical check upon de-planing and had to fill out a health form. The interview published at around 11:25 a.m. PDT or 2:25 p.m. ET, not long after Vanilla Ice tweeted his plane updates, so perhaps he was just chilling on the runway for the afternoon. The tweet timing mystery aside, it looks like Vanilla Ice was on the plane after all, and sadly the setback caused him to miss his connecting flight to Florida. Will the 2018 drama ever stop?

Reader's Digest,"Some terms are considered too improper to be spoken by royalty. In her book ""Watching the English"", social anthropologist Kate Fox explains which words are banned from the royal family's vocabulary and the surprising reasons why. 1. Tea FYI, we're talking about the meal, not the soothing, healthy drink. In many parts of the U.K., the evening meal that takes place between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. is called tea. However, this term is typically associated with the working class. Members of upper social classes, including the royal family, call this meal dinner or supper. 2. Portion The royals don't watch their portion sizes to lose weight. Instead, they watch their helping sizes, using another upper class term. Do you know the right serving sizes for your favorite foods? Take our portion distortion quiz to find out! 3. Pardon If and when (we can be optimistic!) you get the honor of meeting anyone in the royal family, you'll want to act on your most polite behavior, excusing yourself when necessary. But whatever you do, don't say ""pardon."" We may think it's formal, but apparently it's like a curse word to the royals. Instead, say ""sorry"" or ""sorry, what?"" After all, it is the magic word that will make you more trustworthy. 4. Toilet Blame this word's French origin for why it's banned in royal circles. ( However, everyone should know these important French phrases.) If you're looking for a restroom in Buckingham Palace, ask for the loo or the lavatory. Don't expect to hear any British slang words from a royal. WPA Pool/Getty Images 5. Lounge While some Brits use the phrase ""living room"" to describe a main front room, the more common term is lounge. The royal family, on the other hand, uses neither. They refer to it as a drawing room or sitting room. 6. Perfume When your friend says she found the secret to making perfume last longer, stop her mid-sentence. The royals don't say ""perfume,"" remind her. They say ""scent,"" as odd as that might sound. In the U.S., the only person we can imagine saying, ""I love your scent"" is an obsessed stalker, but maybe if we say it enough, we'll get used to it. Maybe. 7. Posh Mark this as one of the British slang words you didn't realize you knew. Sadly, the royal family doesn't use it—nor does the rest of upper class society, even though their lifestyle is the epitome of the word. They replace posh with smart. 8. Mum and Dad Ma, Pops, Mommy, Daddy—We all had different names for our parents growing up, but for the most part, they turned into ""Mom and Dad"" as we got older. Not so for the royal family. They call their parents Mummy and Daddy even as adults. Isn't it endearing to think of Prince Charles calling Queen Elizabeth Mummy?

Originally designed for professional use, these headphones started life in 2007 as the M50 model that had a fixed cable, evolved into the M50x in 2014 with a removable cable, and today blossom into the M50xBT that requires no cable at all. The look, design, and sound signature have barely changed in all that time, and Audio-Technica promises that the new wireless M50xBT will maintain everything familiar and beloved about the existing M50 lineage. Developed by the same two engineers as the original M50s, the M50xBT have been built with wireless performance as the priority — so much so that Audio-Technica says they’ll sound pretty much identical to the M50x when used wirelessly, and different (read: worse) when wired up via an included analog cable with a 3.5mm plug. The sound driver inside each ear cup has been tuned to match the sonic signature of Audio-Technica’s previous model, and the built-in digital to analog converter further ensures a consistent sound, no matter what device is connected. Equipped with Bluetooth 5 and support for AAC and ApX codecs, the M50xBT are rated to last for 40 hours on a charge. They’re part of a dwindling breed of over-ear wireless headphones that don’t provide active noise cancellation. Common expectations nowadays demand that headphones in this class provide active noise cancellation, though Audio-Technica would argue that it’s building on a strong pedigree with a product that already offers a fair amount of passive noise isolation through its closed-back design. Keeping up with other modern trends, Audio-Technica supports both Siri and Google Assistant on the M50xBT, which can be activated with a prolonged tap on the new touch controls on the left ear cup. The one common gripe that many will have with the M50xBT is Audio-Technica’s use of Micro USB charging instead of the newer and better USB-C. The company provided the following comment to The Verge in response: “Our aim with the M50xBT was to create a Bluetooth version of the M50x that not only shares the same sonic signature but that also has an affordable price. On this particular project, adding a USB-C cable would have added to the cost of the product and we felt it was essential to invest in replicating the iconic sound and retaining the durability and quality of the M50xBT whilst also keeping the headphones below £200 ($200).” Audio-Technica is fully conscious that the wider industry is pushing ahead with USB-C aggressively, and it says it will have USB-C headphones further down the line. It just won’t be these M50xBTs. Priced at $199 / €199 / £179, the Audio-Technica M50xBT are available to buy right away. In the US, Amazon and Best Buy will have the first stock of them, while in Europe, they’ll be available mostly online until January. With Amazon being Audio-Technica’s biggest customer for the M50x — which, together with the M50, have sold 1.8 million units to date — it appears Audio-Technica has decided to give the giant US retailer the priority.","Audio-Technica has announced the wireless M50xBT headphones. These are the successor to the Audio-Technica M50x, a pair of headphones designed for professionals but embraced by critical reviews and consumers alike.",2018-10-30T15:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Audio-Technica makes its best-selling M50x headphones wireless,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/30/18039988/audio-technica-m50xbt-bluetooth5-wireless-headphones-price-release-date,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFow_G6-i01Z31xvZQkdCnrb7cY=/0x56:2040x1124/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13356833/m50xbt.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-5,1
"Ray Sanchez, CNN","By Ray Sanchez, CNN Updated 11:30 AM ET, Sun February 18, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. This account of Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, is based on official statements, interviews with survivors, their relatives and law enforcement officials, as well as other CNN reporting. (CNN) -- On Valentine's Day morning, Nikolas Cruz's 5-foot-7-inch, 120-pound frame couldn't be shaken from his bed in suburban Parkland, Florida. Cruz, 19, lived on a lush street dotted with tropical plants with a family who had opened their home to him after the death of his adoptive parents. The father, James Snead, normally delivered Cruz to his adult GED class on the way to work. Wednesday was different. ""I don't go to school on Valentine's Day,"" the freckle-faced Cruz insisted. At his former high school five miles away, a new day was beginning. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's free breakfast was winding down. The 7:40 a.m. bell signaling the start of first period loomed. The ""daily morning affirmation"" that day on the public school's website came from the late self-help author Louise Hay: ""Life supports me in every way possible."" Lori Alhadeff dropped off her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, at the sprawling campus, home to more than 3,000 students. ""I love you,"" she told Alyssa. That day, teachers collected applications for the National English Honor Society. Members of the tennis teams raised money with the sale of hoodies, yoga pants and other items. Classmates exchanged Valentine's Day carnations sold for $1 in a cafeteria. At lunchtime, some students left $60 deposits for graduation rings. The school day went on as normal. But before the last bell of the day could ring, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School -- whose motto tells students to ""be positive, be passionate"" -- would be the scene of one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. It was no secret to those that knew him that Cruz was fascinated with guns and violence. He posed with guns and knives on Instagram, showed guns to a former classmate and kept a semiautomatic rifle in a lockbox in his room. A former classmate said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a ""school shooter."" The orphaned youth also battled mental illness and depression, his attorneys said later, exacerbated by the recent death of his adoptive mother. She had repeatedly called police to the home to help deal with his violent outbursts. A defense attorney called him ""a broken child."" Cruz eventually made it out of bed that Valentine's Day. He exchanged a number of unremarkable text messages with the son of the family he stayed with and called an Uber. At 2:19 p.m., a gold-colored Uber vehicle dropped him off at the school he once attended. A school employee recognized him. Cruz had been expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons. Now he was back, with a.223-caliber AR-15 rifle concealed in a soft black case. The employee alerted a colleague that the former student was ""walking purposefully"" toward a school building. The school, like many across the US, had made active shooter training drills its protocol. Cruz entered the school building at the east stairwell. He pulled the rifle out of its bag. At some point, Cruz activated a fire alarm. Nicole Baltzer, 18, was in trigonometry class. In 10 minutes, the school day would be over. Why was the fire alarm blaring again? There had been a fire drill earlier in the day. This second one sowed confusion, and students began to scurry from classrooms. Cruz began the massacre, initially targeting people on the first floor. Bursts of semiautomatic fire echoed in the corridors. ""So many shots,"" Baltzer said. ""They were very close."" Freshman Kelsey Friend and her classmates in geography class rushed back into their classroom once they heard the shots. Her teacher, Scott Beigel, 35, unlocked the door for them. There he stood, like a sentry, ushering his students to safety. She thought Beigel would follow her inside. He didn't. The sound of gunfire grew louder. Friend wanted to believe this was just another drill. A more realistic one maybe, with police officers shooting blanks. Other students thought firecrackers were causing the staccato bursts. Then Friend realized this was no drill. Beigel's body crumpled to the floor at the classroom door. Later she would say, ""I am alive today because of him."" The first 911 call came at 2:23 p.m. The shooter's identity was already known. ""I'm being told, advised by the employees, that it should be a student,"" an officer at the school radioed to dispatch. ""Nikolas Cruz, Nikolas Cruz, who came in on campus with a backpack."" Another transmission provided more information: ""I'm being advised by ROTC students that he was kicked out last year. We're still looking for a photo -- he worked at a Dollar Store on Magnolia. Last name spelling is C-R-U-Z."" 'I'm in a school shooting right now' Terrified, the students turned to the familiar: cell phone cameras, text messages, Snapchat and Twitter. They gave the world a glimpse into their horror as it unfolded. Trembling hands. Blood-curdling screams. Bullet-strewn classrooms. Blood-stained floors. Bodies. ""I'm in a school shooting right now."" He hunkered down under a desk in a dark classroom. The shooter stalked the corridors outside. Minutes later, Aidan tweeted again. ""My school is being shot up and I am locked inside. I'm f***ing scared right now."" The tweet included photos of students huddled on the floor. They checked their phones between desks. One appeared to be texting. In 17-year-old Hannah Carbocci's Holocaust history class, a bullet pierced the wall. She thought of her big sister, her protector. Pop-pop! Pop-pop! Screams. More gunshots. Hannah, under a teacher's desk, texted her 19-year-old sister Kaitlin. kaitlin there is a shooter on campus kaitlin i am not joking they just shot through the walls someone in my class is injured 'The Kevlar would slow the bullet down' Assistant coach and security guard Aaron Feis, a graduate of the School, put himself between three students and the shooter, an act of bravery that surprised no one. Feis was shot. He died after he was rushed into surgery. Colton Haab, a 17-year-old junior and football player, would say later, ""That's Coach Feis. He wants to make sure everybody is safe before himself."" As the shots rang out, Haab ushered 60 to 70 people to shelter in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps room. They shielded themselves behind sheets of Kevlar used for Junior ROTC marksmanship practice. ""The Kevlar would slow the bullet down,"" Haab thought. Teacher Melissa Falkowski hid in a large closet with nearly 20 students. She brought them in from the hallway. Some were crying. Other were calling or texting family with words of gratitude and love. Cruz wasn't done. He roamed the first-floor halls before going to the second floor. He shot a victim in another room. On the third floor, he dropped his rifle and bag. He then ran out of the building, blending in with students and staff who were pouring out of the school, many with their hands in the air. Responding officers suspected as much. ""Someone checking the IDs of those kids before they get up and leave the area?"" an officer radioed to dispatch. Later came another transmission: ""Attention all units, be advised -- a repeat of the last instruction -- juveniles being loaded onto the buses are going to park. The IDs need to be checked of the juveniles before they get on the buses. Make sure that Nikolas Cruz isn't part of this group."" 'I knew at that point she was gone' But Cruz slipped away. He bought a drink at a Subway sandwich shop inside a nearby Walmart. Later, he sat at a McDonald's for a few minutes. Police helicopters buzzed overhead. Tearful students reunited outside the school with their parents. Lori Alhadeff, hours after dropping off her daughter Alyssa, raced back to the school when she learned of the shooting. ""I knew at that point she was gone,"" she said. ""I felt it in my heart."" Alyssa didn't make it. Other students remained on lockdown. Not taking chances, some called 911 before letting SWAT teams members enter. ""Student in Classroom 1255 says somebody's pushing on her door -- is that a police officer? Any units pushing on 1255?"" a police dispatcher asked. ""Yes, yes, 1255, that's going to be us,"" an officer responded. ""You want them to open it or do you want me to tell them to stand down?"" ""Tell her to open her door, have her open her door right now!"" As student Masiel Baluja evacuated, she put her book bag on her back just in case she got shot from behind. She ran toward students and teachers. She jumped a fence before police escorted her to a group of students assembled near Walmart. She could see her mother, but Masiel was suspicious of those around her. ""I didn't know if any of them were shooters or not,"" Masiel said later, fighting back tears. ""I felt very uncomfortable because anybody can be a shooter."" 'He looked like a typical high school student' A police officer made contact with Snead, the father who had taken in Cruz after the teen's mother died last fall. Snead said he had spoken with Cruz, who told him he was at the McDonald's near campus. Nearly 80 minutes after the first 911 call, a police officer from nearby Coconut Creek spotted a young man walking along the side of a residential street. The description and clothing matched the shooter's. ""He looked like a typical high school student,"" officer Michael Leonard said. ""For a quick moment I thought, 'Could this be the person? Is this who I need to stop?'"" Leonard pulled over and Cruz, wearing a maroon polo shirt with the school's eagle mascot on the sleeve, surrendered without incident. ""We have the suspect detained,"" came the radio call at 3:41 p.m. The suspect in the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook was caught and 17 people were dead.",It felt like a normal Valentine's Day at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Then someone noticed a troubled former student carrying a bag and striding purposefully towards a school building.,2018-02-18T16:30:26Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Inside the massacre, moment by moment",https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/18/us/parkland-florida-school-shooting-accounts/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180214182416-29-florida-high-school-shooting-0214-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,class-5,1
Ingrid Lunden,"Chorus.ai, a service that listens to sales calls in real time, and then transcribes and analyses them to give helpful tips to the salesperson, has raised $33 million to double down on the current demand for more AI-based tools in the enterprise. The Series B is being led by Georgian Partners, with participation also from Redpoint Ventures and Emergence Capital, previous investors that backed Israeli-founded, SF-based Chorus.ai in its $16 million Series A two years ago. In the gap between then and now, the startup has seen strong growth, listening in to some 5 million calls, and performing hundreds of thousands of hours of transcriptions for around 200 customers, including Adobe, Zoom, and Outreach (among others that it will not name). Micha Breakstone, the co-founder (who has a pretty long history in conversational AI, heading up R&amp;D at Ginger Software and then Intel after it acquired the startup; and before that building the tech that eventually became Summly and got acquired by Yahoo, among other roles ), says that while the platform gives information and updates to salespeople in real time, much of the focus today is on providing information to users post-conversation, based on both audio and video calls. One of its big areas is “smart themes” — patterns and rules Chorus has learned through all those calls. For example, it has identified what kind of language the most successful sales people are using and in turn prompts those who are less successful to use it more. Two general tips Breakstone told me about: using more collaborative terms like we and us; and giving more backstory to clients, although there will be more specific themes and approaches based on Chorus’s specific customers and products. “I’d say we are super attuned to our customers and what they need and want,” Breakstone said. Which makes sense given the whole premise of Chorus. It also creates smart “playlists” for managers who will almost certainly never have the time to review hundreds of hours of calls but might want to hear instructive highlights or ‘red alert’ moments where a more senior person might need to step in to save or close a deal. There are currently what seems like dozens of startups and larger businesses that are currently tackling the opportunity to provide “conversational intelligence” to sales teams, using advances in natural language processing, voice recognition, machine learning and big data to help turn every sales person into a Jerry Maguire (yes, I know he’s an agent, but still, he needs to close deals, and he’s a salesman). They include TalkIQ (which has now been acquired by Dialpad), People.AI, Gong, Voicera, VoiceOps, and I’m pulling from a long list. “We were among the very first to start this, no one knew what conversational intelligence was before us,” Breakstone says. He describes most of what was out in the market at the time as “Nineties technology” and adds that “our tech is superior because we built it in the correct way from the ground up, with nothing sent to a third party.” He says that this is one reason why the company has negative churn — it essentially wins customers and hasn’t lost any. And having the tech all in-house not only means the platform is smarter and more accurate, but that helps with compliance around regulations like GDPR, which also has been a boost to its business. It’s also scored well on metrics around reps hitting targets better with its tools (the company claims its products lead to 50 percent greater quota attainment and ‘ramp time’ up by 30 percent for new sales people who use it). Chorus.ai has helped us become a smarter sales organization as weve scaled. We have visibility into our sales conversations and what is working across all of our offices”, said Greg Holmes, Head of Sales for Zoom Video Communications, in a statement. Weve seen a drastic reduction in new hire ramp times and higher sales productivity with even more reps hitting quota. Chorus.ai is a game changer. Chorus has raised $55 million to date and Breakstone said he would not disclose its valuation — despite my best attempts to use some of those sales tips to winkle the information out of him. But I understand it to be “significantly higher” than in its last round, and definitely in the hundreds of millions. As a point of reference, after its Series A two years ago, it was only valued at around $33 million post-money according to PitchBook. Maintaining high-quality sales conversations as you scale a sales organization is hard for many companies, but key to delivering predictable revenue growth. Chorus.ais Conversation Intelligence platform solves that challenge with a market-leading solution that is easy-to-use and delivers best-in-class results. said Simon Chong, Managing Partner at Georgian Partners, in a statement. (Chong is joining the board with this round.) Chorus.ai works with some of the best sales teams in the world and they love the product. We are very excited to partner with Chorus.ai on their next phase of growth as they help world class sales teams reach higher quota attainment and efficiency.","Chorus.ai, a service that listens to sales calls in real time, and then transcribes and analyses them to give helpful tips to the salesperson, has raised $33 million to double down on the current demand for more AI-based tools in the enterprise.

Jordan Ramée,"Developers from DICE held a Reddit AMA to answer questions people had about the classes and combat roles in Battlefield 5. Questions were addressed by Battlefield 5's multiplayer producer David Sirland, design director Danial Berlin, and senior producer Andreas Morell. The Reddit AMA was done in response to the recent blogs detailing Battlefield 5's four classes-- Assault, Medic, Recon, and Support --and their respective combat roles. Every class gets two combat roles that come with unique loadouts to fit different play styles. Assault's combat roles are Light Infantry and Tank Buster, while Medics are divided into Field and Combat. The Recon class can take on the role of a Sniper or Pathfinder, and you can Support your teammates as an Engineer or a Machine Gunner. ""The weapon restrictions sits on your class and not on the combat role,"" Morell wrote. ""So if you play Support and pick the machine gunner role you will be better suited to handle MMGs with the passive traits you have, but you are not limited to MMGs--you can play with any support weapons you like."" Morell went on to add that the Tanker/Pilot classes also still technically exist. You won't preselect the class beforehand like with the other four, though. Instead, you take on the Tanker/Pilot class when you spawn into a vehicle or aircraft. Because of this, you won't be able to customize your individual Tanker/Pilot class, however, you'll be able to change the parts in the vehicle you drive--both cosmetically and mechanically--for your own ideal experience. Sirland confirmed you'll be able to switch between whichever class and combat role you're using on the deploy screen, so you won't be tied to any one class or combat role for an entire match. However, the second combat role for each class is locked at the game's launch, and you'll need to play as the class you want to unlock the second combat role for. Sirland added there might be a future possibility that players unlock combat roles through Tides of War or Assignments, but DICE hasn't decided on that yet. According to Berlin, the team is already looking at the results of the Battlefield 5 beta to update some of the classes. ""We are looking into the ability for the Medic to choose between the medic pouch and crate within the first gadget slot, and the same thing goes for the Support--being able to choose between the ammo pouch and crate on gadget slot 1,"" wrote Berlin. The team wants to maintain the role of Medics and Supports as complementary classes to Assault and Recon, but it thinks both classes could use a bit more customization. Battlefield 5 launches on November 20 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. There is both a Standard and Deluxe Edition of the game, both of which come with pre-order bonuses.","Developers from DICE held a Reddit AMA to answer questions people had about the classes and combat roles in Battlefield 5.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","My daughter recently started kindergarten, and for the first couple of weeks of school, I was an eager mom, waiting to pick her up at the end of the day and hear all about her new adventures. Id step through the classroom door, stretch my arms open and say, Hi, lady! and then wait for her to run and embrace me like she often did when she was in preschool. Instead, shed glance up, slump over and drag her feet over to her backpack. On the drive home, things would only go downhill. So... Id say, smiling at her in the rearview mirror. How was your day? Shed grunt. Then she would whine about something (usually how much she wants to watch a show on the iPad, and why, why, why wont I let her?) and wed start arguing. By the time wed get to the house, shed be a pouty mess and Id be counting down the minutes until bedtime. I had always heard about after-school meltdowns but now I can personally attest: Yes, they are a thing. In fact, they are such a common thing that psychotherapist Andrea Nair has coined the phenomenon after-school restraint collapse. When kids are forced to keep it together for such a long stretch of time, sitting criss-cross-applesauce and waiting their turns and following the social norms of the day, the moment they get a chance to break, they do. (For better or worse, you are their safe place to collapse.) They might cry or protest or just seem generally fragile. It may have something to do with school, but often, it doesnt. My daughter loves kindergarten and usually talks about it nonstopabout how her teacher says funny things, and how she got to be the flag helper, and how she guessed the correct number of Jolly Ranchers in the estimation jar. It was just that period from about 5 to 6 p.m. that sucked. And fighting it only made it worse. What has helped, Ive found, is planning for it. Expecting the meltdownwelcoming it, even. For us, this has been the only way to make it through to the other side. Here are some ways to support your kids through the dreaded daily transition. First, Calm Yourself If youve just finished a long work day, chances are youre ready for your own restraint collapse. Give yourself five minutes to breathe and refocus before picking up your kids from school. You might take a walk around the block or do a guided meditation or write down a few things youre grateful forwhatever will help you be more present for the next few hours. Once youre with your children, keep your phone tucked away, say Im happy to see you! ( not How was your day? ) and then listen for what they might need. Its usually some silence and space to just be. During the early days of new parenthood, my husband once asked me when he got home from work, Read more Read Feed Them Whether or not they finished their lunch that day, kids are famished after school. Ive learned to come armed with a granola bar or a banana or, on overachieving days, a smoothie. This helps alleviate the hanger. If it works for your schedule, you might even try feeding your kid dinner at 3 p.m. It sounds extreme, but there are all sorts of reasons why it makes sense. With school-aged children, there is a period of gastrointestinal chaos, and that period is every Read more Read Unschedule Them My daughter used to take a weekday swim class at 6 p.m., and it worked out fine. Then when she started kindergarten, it became a disaster. The after-school meltdown still happened, but it happened while she was standing there dripping wet in front of a crowd on the bleachers. We promptly canceled the activityit was just too much. Now we lay low after school, and its been better. When we get home, I might put my daughter in the bathtub ( water relaxes kids ) or read a book to her in the backyard. If your kids have homework, let them run around for a while before they sit down to do it. Letting them play vigorously for just 30 minutes can pump extra blood to their brain, delivering the oxygen and nutrients it needs to perform better. Its come to this: Doctors are now being told to prescribe play. The American Academy of Pediatrics Read more Read Look Out for Other Factors With an understanding attitude and some schedule changes, the meltdowns should subside. But if they dont, check for other factors. Is your child getting enough sleep at night? Has something been happening at school? Talk to your kids teacher about what youre seeing. If the problems persist after a couple of months, consult your pediatrician or a child therapist.","My daughter recently started kindergarten, and for the first couple of weeks of school, I was an eager mom, waiting to pick her up at the end of the day and hear all about her new adventures.

Anamitra Banerji,"Pre-seed has risen in prominence in recent months due to the growing gap between what founders are seeking at the seed stage and what the market is offering, yet conversations around pre-seed come with preconceived notions and false assumptions about the companies and investors who care about early stage funding. To break down these misconceptions, we’ve assembled a list of 5 common myths about pre-seed and share what’s behind our passion for feeding the ideas of tomorrow’s next great companies. Myth 1. Pre-Seed Investors Invest in Ideas (and Little Else) The term pre-seed investing brings to mind a simple transaction: the founder with a great resume has an idea, the investor writes a check, and it’s no big deal if things don’t work out because it’s just an experiment. The misconception is that because companies don’t have traction data, pre-seed investors don’t have much to investigate and thus can’t evaluate deeply. This kind of zombie-like trade is far from reality. Institutional pre-seed funds such as Afore believe that pre-seed is just like any other kind of investing, with risks inherent to its stage that can be successfully mitigated. Beyond assessing founder authenticity and market opportunity, we focus on two specific areas: product and distribution. We care about unique product insights and novel distribution approaches and want to know how both will work in the short-term. We’ll learn about what experiments the founders have run to-date to validate their hypotheses, and we keep probing until we hear “I don’t know.” While pre-seeds may not have traction in data, there’s plenty of traction in thought. Myth 2. Pre-Seed Companies Couldn’t Raise a Real Seed Round. It’s assumed that companies seeking pre-seed investment simply aren’t good enough to raise a seed round, and must pare down their pitches and expectations in order to raise a smaller round. This misconception discourages investors from pre-seed opportunities, delivering the wrong message that there’s adverse selection at play because the company knows it’s not good enough to seek a bigger round. Raising pre-seed funding helps build and distribute the product, providing early traction with the least amount of capital. Founders are increasingly realizing that seed investors do not write the first check––with most seed capital coming 2.4 years after a company’s founding. Afore is part of a new class of pre-seed investors funding pre-product/market fit companies. Startups that lack product/market fit and the ability to scale aren’t ready for seed capital. These investors supplement the friends and family round, providing institutional capital previously available much later. Pre-seed founders should raise $500K because it’s better than bootstrapping, and eliminates the potential for the high valuations and dilution inherent with raising large seed rounds. Myth 3. Pre-Seed Investing is All About Creating Optionality. Another myth is that backers in these earliest-stage companies are casual investors who don’t actually know what they’re doing or care about their investments. Similar to an option bet, the idea is that investors have little to lose by placing money across a multitude of opportunities. No founder likes to be an option bet or should choose an investor who doesn’t make them a priority. Funds like Afore are active investors exclusively focused on pre-seed who live and die by the success of their portfolios. Pre-seed investment isn’t an option bet to preempt the seed or Series A; it’s their bread and butter. Pre-seed is a burgeoning segment comprised of deeply thoughtful, committed institutional investors that includes pre-seed capital firms like Bee Partners, K9, Pear, Precursor, Notation, Wonder, and many others. Further highlighting marketplace need, PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association revealed that funding for companies of $1M or less is at its lowest point since 2011. Myth 4. The Pre-Seed Category is a Fad. Rumblings persist that pre-seed investing is a flash in the pan that will collapse into standard seed investing soon enough. This is an idea based on the inaccurate belief that pre-seed only cropped up due to a bullish investing market. Pre-seed stage companies look very different from seed stage companies in that they don’t have much traction, revenue, or product/market fit. And seed investors are uncomfortable with that level of risk. It’s hard to invest in companies without traction or revenue when compared with companies that possess cohort analysis, accurate LTV/CAC ratios and a strong grasp of their sales funnel. In this apples-to-oranges comparison, seed investors cannot also invest in pre-seed. Another factor is the increasing size of seed funds. As fund sizes scaled, seed investors were forced to write bigger checks, pushing seed rounds closer to $5M. Given that the Partner time does not scale with fund size (that is until Elon Musk invents the 30-hour day!), there is no easy way for seed funds to write pre-seed sized checks for $500K then dedicate the time and attention they deserve. As long as institutional investors have the appetite, experience and ability to take the “first check risk” well ahead of product/market fit, there will always be a need for the pre-seed round. Myth 5. Pre-Seed Funds Couldn’t Raise a Real Fund. Misconceptions about VC funds that focus on the pre-seed stage are also numerous. You may hear: pre-seed firms brand themselves that way because they can’t raise larger funds; they’d actually like to raise seed and series A funding but haven’t been successful; or it was never their true intention to invest in such early stage companies. Experience tells us otherwise. Our peer GPs all saw the venture trends early as well as the emerging gap in early stage funding and, being entrepreneurs, they took advantage.

Soraya Ferdman,"Come this new school year, consider taking time to help teachers in underfunded schools meet their students' needs. In the past decade, U.S. public education has undergone massive budget cuts, leaving many classrooms without fundamental resources. A recent study published by the American Federation of Teachers, a nationally organized union, cites a decrease in teacher's salaries and an increase in teacher-to-student ratios. And yet, the vast majority of teachers still spend their own money on classroom supplies. According to the United States Department of Education, 94% of teachers report paying for school supplies, without reimbursement. The same study calculated teachers spend on average $479 annually of their own money on classrooms, with 15 percent reporting closer to $800 annually. SEE ALSO: Teachers make their own epic version of Carpool Karaoke with yodelling and floss dancing ""Great classrooms don't just happen"" said Chris Pearsall, vice president of brand and communications at DonorsChoose, a nonprofit organization that has helped crowdfund over 600,000 classroom project requests. ""Teachers rarely have more than a few supplies left from the previous year, so back-to-school season is when a lot of them stock up."" As students return to school, here are some ideas for how you can help teachers. 1. Expand classroom libraries Help teachers expand their classroom libraries. Books are the most popular request on the DonorsChoose website. A lot of teachers love to request graphic novels or books that are coming out as movies (like Wonder or The Hate U Give ), so that their students can connect with the material on multiple levels. Scholastic also has ""ready-to-go"" classroom libraries for each grade level. You might consider partnering with other parents to purchase a collection for a local teacher. 2. Cover classroom basics Classroom basics are often the first items teachers pay for out of pocket: pens, pencils, erasers, paper, cleaning supplies... they quickly add up, but they're must haves for a successful classroom. 3. Provide a 21st century education ""More than anything else, teachers crave technology for their classrooms,"" Pearsall said in a blog post for DonorsChoose. According to the company's findings, teachers consistently rank technology as the most urgent expenditure schools can make. Look through requests for tablets, smart boards, and more here. As many students have limited or no access to technology at home, their school becomes crucial for acquiring modern computer skills. Getting early exposure to technology can help them prepare for future careers, and it also supports students with different, specialized learning needs. Accessibility is key, and tech helps teachers who have students with disabilities. Image: DonorsChoose 4. Help teachers start a school garden Class gardens teach students about life cycles, nutrition and health, sustainability, and the environment, as well as responsibility, observation, and teamwork. If you want to do more than donate to a class garden project at DonorsChoose and bring an outdoor garden to your school, consider talking to school officials and plan to take on the responsibility of organizing the project, as not to put extra labor on already over-stretched school faculty. Use these talking points and this starting guide for those who need convincing. You can also get in contact with Real School Garden, an organization that partners with high-poverty schools to build community gardens. 5. Support the arts Support art teachers in need of construction paper, paint brushes, instruments, and more. Funding for music and visual and performing arts is often one of the first departments to get cut from a school budget. Many students also don't have the money for instruments or expensive arts supplies, and so rely on their school for these opportunities. 6. Help teachers take students on an adventure Teachers are constantly thinking of ways to expand learning outside the classroom, but it is not so easy to make this happen. Field trips can be time consuming to plan and expensive to execute. To help teachers broaden their student's experiences, check out these projects on DonorsChoose. 7. Support students who are struggling with poverty A lot of teachers pay out of pocket for food and even clothes, shoes, and personal hygiene items for their students. With the right essentials, students can come to school clean, comfortable, fed, and confident, focused on their school work. This DonorsChoose link connects you with teachers raising money for their low-income students. Another option is to contact your local food bank (which you can use this link to find). Feeding America, an anti-poverty organization with a network of 200 food banks across the country, has a BackPack Program that prepares bags of food for low-income children. ""For more than 15 years, the Feeding America BackPack Program has been helping children get the nutritious and easy-to-prepare food they need to get enough to eat on the weekends,"" according to Feeding America. 8. Help teachers instruct their students on tolerance and diversity Teachers need help preparing students for an inclusive, diverse society. There are several crowdfunding projects on DonorsChoose focused specifically on tolerance and diversity. One teacher has asked for funding for a project that celebrates students' heritages and diversity while another asks for picture books about tolerance. With recent teacher protests - most notably in Oklahoma, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Arizona - shedding light on the degree to which public school teachers are struggling to meet their children's needs, it is perhaps time for citizens step up and show their support.","Come this new school year, consider taking time to help teachers in underfunded schools meet their students' needs.

,"Mayank Markande finished with figures of 5 for 31 in the second innings. © BCCI 
Mayank Markande's five-fer bundled out England Lions for 180 after they were asked to follow on, helping India A to an innings and 68-run win and 1-0 win in the two-match series in Mysuru.
Having bundled out England Lions for 144 in the first essay on Thursday, KL Rahul - India A skipper - had asked the visitors to bat again. The openers had safely marshaled the team to 24 for no loss and stumps on the second day, but damage happened early on Day 3.
Barring Ben Duckett's quickfire half-century at the top of the order and Lewis Gregory's 49- ball 44 lower down, there were no noteworthy performances with the bat as they were tourists were bowled out in less than 54 overs.
The collapse began with the fall of Duckett, trapped LBW by Jalaj Saxena soon after notching up his 23rd first-class fifty.
Markande, who went wicketless in his seven overs in the first innings was the wrecker-in-chief of the collapse. The leggie picked his third first-class fifer - accounting for the wickets of Ollie Pope, Steven Mullaney, Dominic Bess, Gregory and Zak Chappell - as only four batsmen managed to register double-digit scores.
Saxena, who dismissed both the openers, bagged his second brace of the match while Navdeep Saini, Shahbaz Nadeem and Varun Aaron picked a wicket each.
Brief scores: India A 392 (Abhimanyu Easwaran 117; Zak Chappell 4-60) beat England Lions 144 (Ollie Pope 25; Navdeep Saini 3-30) &amp; 180 (Ben Duckett 50; Mayank Markande 5-31) by an innings and 68 runs

Kevin Billings,"It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall. For students, that means hearing the three words they fear the most: ""back to school."" Whether it's heading to college at the end of August or high school after labor day, education is going to be the priority again. SEE ALSO: 20 things you need to survive life in a college dorm If there is a silver lining to this time of year, it's all the back to school sales that have or are going to start in the coming weeks. Whether you need basic class supplies or have to load up for a dorm, everything you could possibly need will be on sale. That also means it's the perfect time for anyone looking to get a new laptop. The right laptop is essential. Luckily, finding a good laptop on sale at this time of year is not a difficult task. Here are some of the best deals right now: The best thing about Chromebooks are their simplicity. These are computers designed for some light web surfing and getting work done and not much more than that. The Samsung XE500C13-S03US is the perfect example of that simple and reliable design. It sports 2GB of RAM with a 16GB SSD, which doesn't sound like a lot, but makes it perfect for school work. And with an 11-hour battery life, you'll be ready to go for those long class days and study sessions. If you need something that might be a little bit faster, then the HP Chromebook 11 G5 could be the laptop for you. On the whole, the HP Chromebook isn't much different from the Samsung Chromebook mentioned above, both sporting the Celeron processor and a 16GB SSD for storage. However, you do get 4GB of RAM with this model from HP, which will provide a nice boost in performance for anyone who needs a little extra oomph out the Chromebook. While regular Chromebooks are always useful, sometimes there's a need for a little more flexibility. To that end, the ASUS Chromebook Flip provides that flexibility with a 2-in-1 design. At a technical level, it's on par with the previously mentioned Chromebooks with 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage for reliable performance. But, as the name implies, the screen can flip for anyone who may need a tablet in a pinch. That sort of flexibility can be a welcome addition, especially in the classroom. As reliable as Chromebooks can be, some classes and school needs may demand more out of your computer. Thankfully, there are laptops that can provide that power without breaking the bank, and Lenovo provides that with the 320-15. Under the hood, the Lenovo sports 6GB of RAM for faster performance and a 1TB HDD, so it doesn't skimp on storage. That extra space is especially useful for those semesters where it seems like you have a paper due every week. Dell is one of the biggest in the game. Because of that, there are certainly plenty of choices available under the Dell banner. And for the average student looking for an above average computer, the Inspiron 15 is the laptop to check out. The Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 is perfect for anyone who needs a killer laptop/tablet combination. And with 8GB of RAM and, again, a 1TB HDD, it delivers flexible power on a budget. This is the alternative to the 2-in-1 mentioned above, more suited for anyone looking for a more traditional laptop out of the Dell Inspiron 15. At a technical level, it's nearly identical as the aforementioned Dell 2-in-1. However, while the 2-in-1 sports the IntelR Core i3, this one has the AMD Ryzen 5, which has emerged as a viable alternative to the Intel line of processors that have dominated the market. And given AMD's background in the games space, the Ryzen processor reflects that with an extra bump in power. If you like the Chromebook, but wish it had a little extra power behind it, Google has just the thing to scratch that itch in the Pixelbook. The Pixelbook offers the flexibility of the basic Chromebooks with specs on par with laptops similar to the aforementioned Dell computers. For example, it uses the Chrome OS and sports an Intel Core i5 processor, highlighting the balance between simplicity and power the Pixelbook offers. And with a 2-in-1 design, it's yet another laptop bolstered by some excellent physical flexibility. All that makes for a laptop that, if you're going into your freshman year at college, will provide longevity. Those are just a few of the laptops you can on sale right now. As the start of the year gets closer and closer, more deals will hit and more laptops will be available at excellent prices. Just keep you're ear to the ground and your browsers locked to Amazon, Walmart, and others for more deals.","It may still be July, but if retailers are to be believed, it's already time to start taking a look forward to the fall.

TYLER KEPNER,"But what about the Baltimore Orioles? They signed a free-agent starter, Alex Cobb, to a four-year, $57 million contract last spring, only to watch him go 5-15 with a 4.90 E.R.A. The team set a franchise record for losses, with 115. Cobb was signed as a rotation stabilizer, not a star, but the move signaled the Orioles intentions to marginally improve. It turned out to be another cautionary tale.
Teams used to pay big money for mediocrity, for the average player, said Steve Phillips, the former Mets general manager and a host on MLB Network Radio. And now theyre not willing to do that, because you can find close to average with a young guy whos not going to cost you money.
Iannetta, in the second season of a two-year, $8.5 million deal, sits squarely in baseballs middle class. He said the union cares equally about the welfare of all members from stars to rookies and said players were frustrated by a system that squeezes out qualified veterans while also keeping elite prospects (think Vladimir Guerrero Jr. of the Toronto Blue Jays) in the minors to manipulate their service time and keep their price low.
As it stands, the worst teams get the best draft picks and the most money to spend on amateur talent. The Astros and the Cubs showed that weathering years of struggle can help lead to sustained success but, of course, not all rebuilding teams will win big.
In their proposal to the owners, the players have advocated a system that would incentivize winning: lower draft position for perennial losers, better draft position for low-revenue teams that win, and so on.
One thing thats going come up in the next few years is: Oh, this is all about dollars and cents; this is all about players being greedy and wanting more, and thats not the case, Iannetta said.

Heather Dockray,"Adolescence can last anywhere from three years to 65 — at least in the case of the Trump administration. Events of the past week have firmly placed the entire Trump White House in the ""middle school drama"" category on Netflix. Between Kelly, the loyal best friend forced to warn Tillerson about his upcoming breakup via tweet, a president who expresses his angst on social media in CAPS LOCK, and Jared being constantly in and out of the Principal Mueller's office, the parallels are just too alarming to ignore. SEE ALSO: Trump reportedly fired Rex Tillerson on Twitter. Ouch. It's worth noting that the Trump administration doesn't actually take place in a binge-able Netflix universe but in real life, where decisions have material consequences outside of ""Benny's going alone to the school dance."" Whatever. Adolescent psychodrama is alive and well in our nation's capitol. Let's analyze these stunted tweens for all they're worth. (Temporary bemusement.) 1. General Kelly is the loyal best friend forced to manage his crazy BFF's drama Everyone knew of a friend pair in middle school where one friend took on the role of the ""personality"" while the other played the ""responsible friend who cleans up their shit."" Loyal BFF Kelly reportedly had to inform Rex Tillerson recently that Trump was planning to fire him using Twitter. He's also tried to push Trump away from bad influences like Omarosa and get him to focus on the after-school activities they both love, like deporting grandpas and separating immigrant mothers from their children at the border. 2. Kellyanne Conway is the resident mean girl who'll always go to bat for the most popular boys in school, especially when they're accused of drunk driving Image: giphy You've got to hand it to Kellyanne — despite her chronic deceitfulness, imaginary massacres, and full-on, multi-agency ethics investigations — this lady has hung on. Kellyanne is the popular girl who's smarter than you think (she ran a respected polling outlet before joining the Trump campaign) and therefore painfully, persistently powerful. 3. Sarah Sanders is the nerd who dropped her musical friends in order to hang with the ""cool Steves"" — Bannon and Miller While you might disagree with everything Sarah Sanders has ever said or done in her life, her performance isn't the same crippling source of humiliation as Spicer's was. Every afternoon I watch Sarah on YouTube and think, ""Everything she just said was a lie,"" followed up with, ""Great use of independent clauses."" Sanders scored an A on all of her midterms and recently took a chastity pledge. Go Sarah! 4. Steve Bannon dropped out of high school after reading a book of Nietzsche quotes he shoplifted from Urban Outfitters Resident gossip and self-identified Leninist Steve Bannon loves nothing more than throwing around words that make him seem like an intellectual: Jumos, globalists, force multipliers. Stevie dropped out of school because it was ""too easy"" for him, but can't stop hanging around school (aka the White House) because the Italo Calvino-inspired ""groundbreaking philosophical novel"" he's working on, is, uh... in development. 5. Jared Kushner is the kid whose mom writes angry letters to his English teacher because she refuses to give him an A ""Critics call my book report on 'Ramona Quimby, Age 8' groundbreaking"" Image: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images Middle East Peace Prince Jared Kushner is still getting app platters with foreign dignitaries despite having a downgraded security clearance and absolutely no knowledge of what he's doing. He's clearly the middling middle school student whose parents harass his nice English teacher into giving him an A on all on his Babysitter's Club book reports because of his ""prescient precocious intellect."" 6. Robert Mueller is the principal who wants to retire but can't because everyone who'd replace him is too dumb Robert Mueller left the FBI five years ago, but came back to be special counsel because no one else in Washington is competent enough to do it. Mueller *is* the middle school principal that's been there since the school's founding and will never, ever retire, despite pushback from conspiratorial parents on the school board. 7. Jeff Sessions is the tiny friendly popular kid who committed a horrible crime in the forest ""Where was I last night? Oh, you know. Just hanging out by the river."" Image: win mcnamee/Getty Images Jeff Sessions, with his Southern charm and throwback ideology, has always been an alt-right darling. Sessions could easily double as the polite popular teacher's pet who committed a horrible crime in the woods one day after school. Don't check his sock drawer! 8. Ben Carson is the kid who overperforms on standardized tests despite saying continuously crazy shit in class The pyramids stored... what? Image: jabin botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Carson killed his PSAT in math, but oh man, you do *not* want to know the explanation he gave for the pyramids on his social studies test. Also, why does he always insist on having the best desk in class? 9. General McMaster is the kid who is smarter than everyone else and is waiting for the day he can leave this small, dumb town General McMaster reportedly thinks Trump has the intelligence of ""a kindergartener "" and is in a constant internal meltdown. Teenage McMaster is just waiting for his acceptance to a private school, where his genius can finally be recognized and he can launch his dream club, ""Young Resentful Neocons of America."" 10. Mike Pence is the quarterback who's so bland, the director had to make him a secondary character As a servant in an administration surrounded by swamp monsters, you'd imagine that Mike Pence would at least be the *fun* kind of evil. Instead, he's become the kind of leader who gets into kerfuffles with teenage ice skaters. Netflix teen comedy Mike Pence would probably have *one* dramatic episode where he stands aside as his friends beat up a gay kid after school. 11. Ivanka Trump is the B student who is now leading her school's Model UN designation because her dad is the coach Afterwards, Ivanka took the whole crew out to Pizzeria Uno. Image: mark wilson/Getty Images When Ivanka Trump delivered her speech at the RNC in 2016, it was absolutely totally fine — nothing brilliant — but fine. Now, she's representing the United States at G20. Teen drama Ivanka similarly dominates her school's Model UN designation despite her lackluster oratory — but only because her father is the team coach. Sally Yates would thrive in that role, if only she hadn't been kicked off the team for standing up to her teacher. 12. Donald Trump is the class clown who accidentally sets fire to the whole school Do not give this man a lighter. Image: kevin diestch-pool/Getty Images Teen Trump hates doing school work, prefers watching TV to reading, and thinks all of those students/cabinet advisors with powerpoints are suck-ups. This is why he's not allowed to go into any room unmonitored. Otherwise, he gets on the phone and kicks up drama with his ""best friends""/allies, or he cyberbullies his teachers/the media from his Twitter account. If only the school had nominated Hillary Clinton to be their Student Body President. But ah!

TARIQ PANJA,"McGregor and the U.F.C. have not commented on the allegations. Karen J. Kessler, a publicist for McGregor based in New Jersey, said he was often the subject of rumors, but would not directly address the validity of the allegation. We dont comment on rumors, she said.
The Beacon is about a 25-minute drive from Crumlin, the working-class South Dublin neighborhood where McGregor grew up. Its typical guests are white-collar workers tied to the financial services or technology companies that have recently relocated to the area. Still, people familiar with the hotel operations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said McGregor had visited before the night the police say the incident took place. He booked the hotels penthouse, the only two-room suite in the facility.
The police investigating the attack retrieved evidence from the room McGregor stayed in and have also secured closed-circuit camera footage, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.
The limitations on naming suspects and McGregors wealth he made an estimated $99 million last year, according to Forbes have created an unusual dynamic in an era when celebrity scandals are usually the subject of fervent media scrutiny. An investigation into Cristiano Ronaldos involvement in a sexual assault, reported to the police in Las Vegas in 2009, has become an international spectacle.
In the McGregor case, some newsrooms in Ireland have barred employees at meetings from even mentioning his name in connection with the case. Managers have asked staff members to refer to him as the famous sportsman, according to a journalist at one of Irelands national newspapers.
An internal memo from the broadcaster RTE leaked into the public domain after his arrest.
The document, which appears to be the schedule for a morning radio show, was stamped not for publication/broadcast in capital letters and was printed on Jan. 18. It explained that McGregor had presented himself at a police station at 5 p.m. a day earlier. On the morning the memo was printed, RTE news bulletins included the story of the man being questioned but did not name him. RTE declined to comment.
The document is one of many messages linked to the case that have been spread widely on social media, via messaging applications as well as internet forums.",Conor McGregor after pleading guilty to a disorderly conduct charge in Brooklyn last year.,2019-03-26T18:22:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Irish Police Investigating Conor McGregor Over Sex Assault Accusation,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/sports/conor-mcgregor-ufc.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/26/sports/00Mcgregor1/00Mcgregor1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
Rudie Obias,"Binoculars were invented for a reason. The human eye is just not built for vision at far distances. We can try as hard as we can, but the furthest the human eye can view is about two to 20 miles away. That doesn’t even account for clarity, visibility, weather and landmass conditions, perspective, and perfect eyesight. Moreover, only about 35% of all humans from around the world have 20/20 vision, so that leaves the rest of us in blurry, blurry darkness. The naked eye is just incapable of viewing very far distances. SEE ALSO: Going somewhere? These are the best websites for finding flights. If you’re a new and experienced outdoorsperson or sportsperson, you’re going to need something to bridge the gap between you and your subject. A good pair of binoculars that can help you look out at far distances for wild animals and birds can make or break a hunting trip, safari, or hike. We combed through many, many pages on Amazon to find the best pair for every type of sportsperson and in every price range. Here are our picks for the 11 best binoculars : Take a look around with Bushnell. Image: Bushnell The Legend L-Series from Bushnell were built with everyone in mind, from the highly advanced to the novice. The all-black magnesium finish with large 42mm diameter lens can bring in as much daylight as possible, while its 8x magnification brings images in with crisp detail. It features all-weather durability with Bushnell’s own RainGuard HD coating with a field of view that reaches up to 426 feet of distance. It even features a locking eyepiece diopter, which is perfect for keeping the focal point in place. The Bushnell Legend L-Series Binocular is also the least intimidating for anyone who is a beginner. Amazon customer Clint Robinson writes: ""These are excellent binoculars. I purchased 3 pair in person before taking a birding friend's advice. These are highly rated for the price, and deserving. I have used these for birding for a year now (twice a week), and I am very pleased. They are well constructed, and I have had 0 problems with them. I highly recommend purchasing these Bushnell Legend L-Series Binoculars for any nature lover, or birder."" The Bushnell Legend L-Series Binocular has an impressive 4.7 out of 5 star rating with 34 reviews from users. For $140, it’s a good place to start for anyone just starting out as a birdwatcher or hunter, as well as experienced sportsmen. Carson VP-842 — Best budget-friendly binoculars We found this pair of binoculars by Carson to be the best budget-friendly option. Image: Carson Getting the best high-quality pair of binoculars doesn’t have to break the bank. The Carson VP-842 binoculars are more than a solid entry level pair. They have a field of view of 273 feet with a 25mm objective lens at 10x magnification. The binoculars weigh in at a light 1.55 lbs, and the pair are both water and fogproof. Amazon customer Uncle Turtle writes: ""These binoculars provide a clear view of wildlife in my backyard or while on a nature walk. I agree they are built like a tank, but not the weight. I was looking at other brands and decided on the Carson's VP series. I made my decision from reading the reviews and watching the Carson provided product videos. I can't wait to view more wildlife with them."" Overall, the Carson VP-842 has a 4.2 out of 5 star rating from 71 customers on Amazon. For only $98, you really can’t go wrong with the quality and price here. If you’re looking for a great pair of binoculars that won’t break the bank, the Carson VP-842 model is for you. This pair of binoculars by Athlon is great for birdwatchers. Image: Athlon The Midas ED Binocular from Athlon Optics is the perfect pair of binoculars for birdwatching. Its large 42mm lens made from ED Glass gives you a clear and sharp image with hardly any fringing from edge-to-edge. Each lens is coated with ESP Dielectric Coating for better images with bright and clear color contrast, while not losing any of that breathtaking clarity at even 8x magnification, so you can see the full detail and colors of birds, whether they're in motion or still. The binoculars even feature argon-purged chambers to reduce fogging and to help fight water damage, which is a birdwatcher’s worst enemy. However, since damage and accidents do happen in the field, each pair of binoculars are backed with a lifetime replacement warranty caused by simple everyday and normal use. Amazon customer M. Matthews writes: ""I bought these binoculars for an upcoming trip to Alaska. I was a little nervous about getting binoculars from a company I had never heard of... All the other binoculars in this price range would have involved some kind of compromise, either a narrow field of view or a of lack of ED glass or a long minimum focusing distance. These binoculars ticked all the boxes for me, and I stayed within my budget (although it was the high end of my budget)."" The Midas ED Binocular from Athlon Optics have a 4.7 out of 5 star rating from 94 customer reviews. They retails for around $280, but the attached lifetime warranty and zero-cost repair are priceless. Get the most for your money with these binoculars by Celestron. Image: Celestron The Celestron TrailSeeker binoculars are great for gathering light and delivering fantastic optical resolution with their 42mm lens and 8x magnification, the industry standard for a good pair of binoculars. While some of the image edges might suffer from blurring, these binoculars will still give you a wonderful and wide field of view for less than $200. And with their lightweight magnesium alloy body, you know you’re going to get something durable, waterproof, and high-quality for the outdoors or in a stadium setting. Amazon customer Life long Mainer writes: ""I ordered these, and have been very impressed. A small river with many birds and deer runs against my property, and a friend was watching a heron on 5/3/17. He took the binoculars, rested them on a small clock near my sink, adding one of my artist's paint brushes, to prop them up the way he wanted, and took this photo with his iPhone THRU the binoculars! The heron was about 80 yards away. The second pic is of his 'set up.' I never knew the binoculars would be used to take distant pictures through, but you can see it's possible!"" The Celestron TrailSeeker has a 4.5 out of 5 star rating from 100 customer reviews on Amazon. Though priced at $240, we've seen these for as low as $150. If you're looking for a pair of premium binoculars, this pair by Vortex Optics is a great choice. Image: Vortex Optics For a premium experience while hunting or birdwatching, the Vortex Optics Viper HD Roof Prism Binoculars are the pair for you. Their massive 50mm objective lenses offer high-end performance with a full-size feel and edge-to-edge clarity. The binoculars also magnify at an impressive 12x, with a field of view of 288 feet at 1,000 yards. They're also built with lifetime fog and waterproofing performance with ultra-hard scratch resistant armortek protection. Amazon customer JnJ writes: ""Better than expected!

Overall, the Vortex Optics Viper HD Roof Prism Binoculars have a 4.5 out of 5 star rating from only two reviews. They retail at $559 and are ideal for luxury outdoor enjoyment. They're basically the Cadillac of binoculars. Take a hike with Pentax. Image: Pentax Keeping a good pair of binoculars on you at all times while hiking through a park or trail is pretty important for enjoying the great outdoors. One of the best things about the Pentax U-Series Papilio II Binoculars are their compact and lightweight size, which comes in under 10.5 ounces. We are also big fans of the unique ""Uni-body"" design. The dual lenses are locked in a single housing with the eyepiece built for synchronizing movement. Just because they're small though doesn't mean you have to sacrifice quality or durability. These binoculars can still take in breathtaking images with their 21mm lens and 8.5x magnification that boasts exceptional edge-to-edge sharpness. Amazon customer Mr. Natural writes: ""I was introduced to these binoculars when taking a bird-watching class. I already had some inexpensive 'permanent focus' binos, and these Pentax binoculars were a revelation! Crisp depth of field for the sharpest images make these the choice for bird/animal watching. Easy and simple focusing system, with retractable eye cups for eyeglass wearers. Can't beat these binoculars for the price!"" The Pentax U-Series Papilio II Binocular has a 4.7 out of 5 star rating with reviews from 68 customers on Amazon. For only $131, they're perfect for any hiker looking to stay light on their feet, while also taking in majestic sights. Look to the stars with Celestron. Image: Celestron These binoculars are no joke! Weighing in just under nine pounds, the Celestron SkyMaster ASTRO Binoculars are ideal for beginner or expert astronomers and stargazers, alike. They feature a humongous aperture, a pair of giant 100mm diameter lenses, and quick 25x magnification to capture images in near-pitch black conditions, while delivering spectacular views and details that might make you think you work at NASA. Although they come with a deluxe padded carrying case, you might also consider getting a tripod considering their heft. Amazon customer Donjonjon writes: ""Amazing binos, i use them a lot a night an the detail that I'm able to obtain is amazing because of the individual adjustment. I also use them to look at birds and the colors and light its a another level! I added a green laser light for night use that way i can align the stars with the light and it works wonders. Save a lot of time too. They are heavy so you will need a tripod."" The Celestron SkyMaster 25X100 ASTRO Binoculars have a 4.1 out of 5 star rating, reviewed by nearly 480 customers. They retail for about $298 and cost considerably less than the Hubble Space Telescope. Pentax AD — Best casual binoculars Looking for something casual? Try Pentax. Image: Pentax For a trusty pair of binoculars that are super portable, the Pentax AD are best for casual use like short hikes or travel. While they're not made for birdwatching or stargazing, they're perfect for throwing into a bag and going on a spontaneous adventure. You'll still get full performance with their compact size, making them a great pair to keep in your purse or bag at all times. Amazon customer Mike writes: ""Bought these to replace older Nikon Sportstar II compact binoculars (similar price range), which fogged up on a damp river trip leaving poor image quality. I wear eyeglasses, and I could never get a full field of view with the Nikons due their short eye relief even with the eye cups folded down. The edges were always indistinct and blurry. The Pentax has longer eye relief and eye cups that quickly telescope out for spectacles-free viewing, and retract for eyeglass wearers. Way better than chintzy fold-down eyecups. With the Pentax I get the full, clear field of view with sharp edges."" The Pentax AD have a 3.7 out of 5 star rating with 8 customer reviews on Amazon. For about $135, the binoculars are a great choice. Hey mom, I love my new binoculars! Image: Educational Insights If you want to explore the great outdoors with your kids, then the Educational Insights GeoSafari binoculars are the best pair to get them started. The pair of kid-friendly binoculars feature soft-grip handles for smaller hands, while kids can explore nature in-depth with their 30mm glass lenses and 4x magnification. There's also a trusty compass attached for some light orienteering. Moms and dads will love that these binoculars can help their kiddos get into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) learning. Amazon customer Paula Johnson writes: ""My 4-year old son loves his new binoculars and compass. He loves to pretend to go on adventures and look through his binoculars at things far away. Santa Claus brought him these binoculars, and he still has interest in them a week later, which for my four-year-old is pretty amazing. He's more of the 'let's-play-with-a-toy-for-five-minutes-and-then-quit' kind of kid. As binoculars go, these aren't like most 'toy' binoculars, where you can barely make out what you are looking at due to the blur. They are actually very clear and cover a good distance. I'm really impressed with them!"" The Educational Insights GeoSafari binoculars have a 4.2 out of 5 star rating with over 220 reviews from Amazon customers. For only $11.99, these colorful binoculars are wonderful for nature walks, camping trips, and all around wilderness adventures. They're so small that they fit in the palm of your hand. Image: Aurosports Whether you’re a novice or an expert, every outdoor enthusiast needs a good pair of binoculars that are durable, compact, and overall functional. The Aurosports Folding High Powered Binoculars are deceptively simple with their lightweight and waterproof build and easily foldable construction. These binoculars features a large field of view with a 25mm objective lens and 10x magnification. The binos even feature a low light level night vision mode that can capture brilliant images at more than 1,000 yards away without giving up detail or clarity during the day or night. At a very inexpensive price point, you really can’t go wrong with this pick. Amazon customer BNC writes: “We are REALLY impressed with the quality of the Aurosport 10x25's. While they have a lower magnification than the Nikon Travelights, they are not short on quality at about 1/3 the price. We have several months yet before we will use them for spotting wildlife, but are confident that we made the right choice in purchasing these and will recommend them to anyone who asks us about them. In summary - an OUTSTANDING product for the money.” With a 4.4 out of 5 star rating from nearly 500 reviews on Amazon, the Aurosports 10x25 Folding High Powered Binoculars are ideal for adults and kids for just about any outdoor activity — especially at that $26.99 price tag. Spare no expense with Leica. Image: Leica If you want the very best in high-end binoculars and money is no object, then the Leica Noctivid binoculars deliver premium optics with super-high quality. The binoculars boast precision engineering and ergonomics from German-made glass that are plasma-coated with a nonslip rubber armoring for comfort and durability. Its 42mm lenses are ideal for sharpness and clarity at long distances with 10x magnification for eye-popping resolution and detail in a solid magnesium housing. Needless to say, the Leica Noctivid is completely weatherproof and waterproof for all of your hunting and birdwatching needs. Amazon customer Michael R. Davis writes: ""I've been using 27 year old Leicas. They have really made improvements over the years. Fantastic product, especially for a bird watcher with middle age eyes on a dark day."" The Leica Noctivid binoculars have a 4.7 out of 5 star rating from only three reviews. For a whopping $2,622, the binoculars are one of the best in its class for luxury and extraordinary detail and image reproduction.","Binoculars were invented for a reason.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. If you're an entrepreneur, an innovator, a startup creator — in other words, a founder — there's a unique and exclusive program that you might be interested in joining. Beyond personal benefits, it can provide direct, tangible benefits to the business or project that you're trying to grow. FoundersCard is a private membership club for — well, founders — designed to provide members with various elite statuses, VIP treatment, and top benefits. In addition, FoundersCard fosters an ambitious, social community of similarly driven people from different industries, helping to facilitate networking opportunities, connections, and more. Despite its name, the FoundersCard isn't a credit card and doesn't involve transactions, which means that anyone can apply, regardless of what country they're from. FoundersCard was founded in 2009 by Eric Kuhn, a new Austin-based venture for a veteran entrepreneur of the 1990s and early-2000s. While the card initially grew its network and offerings slowly — and had a few early bumps in the road — it's made leaps and bounds over the past few years as an organization. Since running into a few issues in its early years, it has bolstered its membership, and made connections with a lot of travel, lifestyle, and business services companies. If FoundersCard sounds like something that could be useful to you, read on to learn more about how it works — and to take advantage of a discounted rate of $395 per year (compared to the normal $595) with a waived initiation fee (usually $95). This rate is a special exclusive for Business Insider readers who apply through this page. How it works To join FoundersCard, you have to complete an application — because the organization is designed to be exclusive and especially curated to be useful and enjoyable for members, everyone isn't always accepted. The process is fairly subjective, You can apply for a preview membership to get a better sense of which benefits are currently active. From there (or right away, if you don't care about the preview), you can fill out the complete application. You have to enter your personal details, including your company name and your title — FoundersCard is open to people other than strictly company founders — as well as your contact and billing information. If you're approved, your payment method will be charged the first year's annual dues — $395, with FoundersCard's exclusive offer for Business Insider readers, or $595 without — and a one-time $95 initiation fee — waived for Business Insider readers. Benefits of FoundersCard membership FoundersCard offers a wide range of benefits that can be loosely broken into three categories: savings and discounts, VIP treatment and perks, and exclusive events. FoundersCard hosts an ongoing series of networking events in cities with high concentrations of members — thanks to business travel, though, there are often different people and new faces at these mixers, even if you go to two in a row in the same city. Usually with 100-200 members, the networking events offer attendees an opportunity to mingle, make connections, and share experience with members from a wide spectrum of industries. Other benefits tend to change as promotions become active, things become available, or FoundersCard negotiates a new partnership or improvement to an existing one, so it's difficult to share a comprehensive picture of what membership entails. There are also a ton of different benefits — this is a deliberate move to appeal to the widest possible cross-section of member, so that there are appealing things to many different people. The following are examples of some perks available at the time of publication. FoundersCard provided Business Insider with a temporary active account in order to access the full benefits portal. Enjoy upgraded service and comfortable seating in JetBlue Mint using FoundersCard's exclusive discount. JetBlue Airline discounts and elite/VIP perks, including: Cathay Pacific offers 5-25% off flights, as well as a complimentary upgrade to Silver elite status. That status includes priority check-in, complimentary advance seat reservations, access to business class lounges while traveling on the airline in any class, and an extra baggage allowance. The status is valid for a year, after which you'll need to re-qualify through normal methods. British Airways offers FoundersCard members up to 10% off most round-trip fares between the US or Canada and the UK. Alaska Airlines offers 5% off fares within the Continental US, Hawaii, and Canada. JetBlue features preferred flat fares for Mint (business class) transcontinental flights, plus up to 5% off coach and business class tickets. Mint fares are as low as $800. American Airlines offers a changing list of benefits, including extra frequent flyer miles, elite qualifying points, or the opportunity to receive complimentary Platinum status for three months, with the chance to keep it by flying a certain required amount within three months. Qantas, the Australian flag carrier, offers a whopping 10-25% off flights from the US to Australia or New Zealand. Emirates offers 5-10% off US originating fares. The airline serves more than 125 destinations around the world, and offers particularly useful routing for those traveling from the US to the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Singapore Airlines discounts US originating flights up to 5%. JetSmarter, a service that helps members find available seats on private and chartered flights as an alternative to flying commercial — but for a much cheaper price tag than flying private normally carries — offers FoundersCard members a free three-month trial. Rental car and chauffeur service discounts and elite statuses, including: Complimentary Preferred Plus membership at Avis, and up to 25% off rentals. Platinum membership at 15% off rentals at Sixt Rent a Car. 20% off all Silvercar reservations — the founder of Silvercar is a FoundersCard member. Credits and discounts with major car services including GroundLink, EmpireCLS, Carey, and Getaround. Exclusive FoundersCard rates, elite statuses, and perks at various hotels brands, including: Starwood Marriott Kimpton Hilton Park Hyatt The Standard Mandarin Oriental Kimpton Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts, and more. Lifestyle and retail discounts, including: Discounts when you buy or lease a new Audi. 20% off at John Varvatos. Up to $10,000 off when you buy or lease a new BMW. A complimentary $100 credit at Trunk Club — the founder and CEO of the company is a FoundersCard member. Complimentary Diamond Total Rewards status at Caesars resorts and casinos, plus 20% off most rooms. 20% off at 1-800-Flowers. 15% off headphones, speakers, and more from Bang &amp; Olufsen.

Business discounts, including: 15% off voice and data plans with AT&amp;T Wireless. Up to 47% off UPS. Up to 50% off Dell computers. 20% off business card and stationary orders from MOO — the company's CEO is a FoundersCard member. A free year of service from the Phone.com virtual office service. A flat 20% discount off products and services from LegalZoom. Loyalty pricing at Apple. 40% off Lenovo computers. 25% off classes at General Assembly — one of the co-founders is a FoundersCard member. This is far from a conclusive list. FoundersCard has hundreds of benefits, discounts, and offers available, and can offer enough value to outweigh the annual fee even if you're a sole proprietor just getting your idea off the ground, or even an individual who can take advantage of the retail and gym discounts. If your small business has grown a bit, though, you can get tremendous value from discounts on shipping, IT services and gear, travel, and more. Between that, and the opportunity to network with like-minded and similarly focused entrepreneurs, FoundersCard presents a unique and potentially valuable opportunity — whether it's worth the $595 annual fee depends on you.","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Amanda Luz Henning Santiago,"Remember the disaster that was the Fyre Festival ? Well, its founder, 26-year-old Billy McFarland, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $26,182,386 on Thursday. McFarland was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud that included the Fyre Festival debacle in which he scammed his investors out of $26 million, according to a Vice News report. SEE ALSO: The best scammers of 2018, ranked Hundreds of millennials traveled to the Bahamas in April of 2017 to attend the Fyre Festival. Once there, it was clear they had been duped out of the experience promised by McFarland and his numerous celebrity endorsersJa Rule, Bella Hadid, Kylie Jenneras a part of his elaborate ticket scam. Tickets to the festival were sold for $450 to over $12,000. Here's a little taste of what attendees endured: So Fyre Fest is a complete disaster. Mass chaos. No organization. No one knows where to go. There are no villas, just a disaster tent city. pic.twitter.com/1lSWtnk7cA William N. Finley IV (@WNFIV) April 27, 2017 The remorse I feel is crushing, McFarland said during his sentencing, according to Vice News. I lived every day with the weight of knowing that I literally destroyed the lives of my friends and family. McFarland's legal team asked for leniency during his sentencing as he was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, claiming he wasn't fully aware of his wrong doings. Judge Naomi Buchwald remained unconvinced, and said that the diagnosis was not an excuse for his past actions. McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud in March related to his Fyre Festival scamming, according to Business Insider. In June he was arrested for another ticket scam : NYC VIP Access, where he sold people $150,000 worth of fake tickets to events, like the Met Gala and the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. In July, two Fyre Festival attendants won a $5 million lawsuit against McFarland. He is also in the midst of a multi-million class action lawsuit filed by multiple ticket holders, according to Vice. It's unclear if McFarland has any of the funds left to pay back these large sums of money. Seems like McFarland hasn't seen the last of the court room, yet.","Remember the disaster that was the Fyre Festival ?

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Love them or hate them, batteries power everything you hold dear, or at least everything inside your phone. You might have a brand new iPhone with a fully charged battery or a dying iPhone 6, whose battery is so degraded it requires a replacement from Apple ( at least it’s discounted ). Sure, all batteries degrade eventually, but you can take some preventative steps to keep them in good health for as long as possible. To keep it operating nominally, you’ll need to occasionally participate in some time-consuming activities, or go against your habits and beliefs as to how you should charge (or discharge) a battery. For the most part, batteries can take care of themselves and combat our bad habits as long as you monitor a few factors. Here’s what you should look into when determining the health of your battery, and how to keep it full of electrons until it’s time for a replacement. Watch for Battery Bloat In college, my laptop’s battery began to bulge, leaving me with two options: replace it with a new one, or wait until it pops out of my laptop during class (guess which one I chose). In retrospect, the chances of my laptop catching fire were pretty high, and it would’ve been pretty devastating if it had gone up in flames. If your battery starts to bulge inside your device, consider it a fire hazard and dispose of it properly. Don’t be like me. Replace your battery. Extreme Temperature Isn’t Good Not too hot, not too cool: a battery at the extreme ends of the weather spectrum is an inefficient one. You should try to keep your battery’s temperature between 5 to 45 °C (41 to 113 °F). Heat causes a battery to speed up its chemical reactions, which translates to a battery that drains faster than it should. A cold battery is equally inhibited by the frigid weather, and has a lower capacity compared to a room temperature battery. One more thing: avoid charging your battery in below freezing temperatures, as you could permanently damage its capacity. Unplugging and Discharging Every battery has a lifespan, measured in the number of cycles. A cycle is complete every time the battery is fully recharged, whether all at once or over the course of a few days. A battery charged from 80% to 100% every day will take five days to complete one full charging cycle. Going from completely dead to fully charged is another charging cycle. In general, you shouldn’t allow your battery to fall to dangerously low levels, and should start charging your devices when they fall below 20% to avoid placing stress on a battery by charging it from such a low level (charging from extremely low levels ages the battery and reduces cycle count). If you want, you can unplug your device after it’s fully charged, though most devices automatically cease charging when their battery is full, negating the worry of degrading the battery. iPhone batteries are one of those things that no matter how long they last, it isn’t going to be… Read more Read Charging a battery also means you’re expending a charge cycle, so the fewer times you charge it, and the less you charge all at once, the longer it will last. That means battery saving measures like Power Save mode on your devices should be considered when you’re looking to maximize your time up and running. Monitoring Your Laptop Battery macOS : Monitoring your battery on the Mac is easy, with the right app. If you’d rather not install any new software, you can look at your Mac’s system information and find the information you need to determine the health of your battery. Hold the Option key and click the Apple menu icon. Choose System Information. Under the Hardware section of the System Information window, select Power. The current cycle count is listed under the Battery Information section. Apple has a list of maximum cycle counts for each laptop so you can see how close you are to the limit, when battery life starts to degrade. Alternately, you could install a more visually pleasing app like Battery Health. The free app offers a simple and colorful view of your battery’s performance and discharge history. You can also view the time spent plugged in or running on battery power to get a better idea (and eventually alter) your charging habits Windows 10 : To see how your battery is faring in your Windows 10 laptop, you can go one of two ways. First, you can use Windows 10 and the command line to generate a battery report, which will detail our battery’s usage history. You can see its cycle count, maximum capacity, current capacity, and usage time to determine whether the lifespan you’re getting is in line with the lifespan advertised. Don’t feel like going into the command line? Download a battery analyzer app like Battery X, which presents your battery health in a clean and simple interface, much different than the HTML battery report Windows 10 generates. Monitoring Your Smartphone Battery iOS : Apple, thanks to its unpopular decision to throttle iPhones with older batteries, is updating its battery management service in the upcoming iOS 11.3 software update. You’ll be able to see the health of your battery as a percentage, and determine whether or not you’re due for a replacement. If you are too impatient to wait, you can always download a battery monitoring app and use it to see how those cells are doing. Android : It’s easy to see what’s draining your battery in Android. You can take a look inside Android’s battery settings to see which service or app is using all of your juice, and adjust your habits accordingly. You can also look into enabling Android Doze, which essentially stops Android apps from constantly draining your battery life with requests for location data, notifications, and other unseen actions. Want more information on your battery health? Try GSam Battery Monitor, which will display a wealth of data about your battery, including its capacity, cycle count, usage time, and which apps are using the majority of your juice.","Love them or hate them, batteries power everything you hold dear, or at least everything inside your phone.

Kristina Cooke,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday appeared open to ordering the government to find potentially thousands of additional children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump administration, which could greatly expand the scope of a lawsuit challenging the separations. 
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego called a January report by an internal government watchdog that found the U.S. government had started implementing its policy of separating families months before it was announced “a very significant event.” 
The Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in a report published earlier this year that the agency had identified many more children in addition to the 2,737 included as part of the class action lawsuit challenging family separations brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) last year. In response to the lawsuit, Sabraw ordered the families identified through a court process to be reunited with their children. 
The ACLU has petitioned the judge to expand the class to force the government to do a full accounting of any additional separated children. 
The premise of the class action lawsuit, Sabraw said, was the “overarching allegation of the unlawful separation” of families by the Trump administration. 
“When there’s an allegation of wrong on this scale, one of the most fundamental obligations of law is to determine the scope of the wrong,” he said. “It is important to recognize we are talking about human beings.” 
The administration of President Donald Trump implemented a “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute and jail all illegal border crossers, even those traveling with their children, leading to a wave of separations last year. The policy sparked outrage when it became public, and the backlash led Trump to sign an executive order reversing course on June 20, 2018.   
In light of the Inspector General’s findings, as well as investigative reporting, Sabraw said, the current June 26, 2018, cut-off date for cases to be part of the lawsuit becomes “very arbitrary.” 
Department of Justice attorney Scott Stewart argued that the ACLU’s request to expand the class would blow the case into an “other galaxy of a task.” The government has argued in court papers that it is too labor intensive to find children who were separated and subsequently released to sponsors before the court order last year. 
While most of the outrage last year focused on the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy, the government has continued to separate families on a smaller scale. In a filing on Wednesday, the government said it had separated 245 children at the border between June 26, 2018, and Feb. 5, 2019 
The government said 92 percent of these children were separated due to “parent criminality, prosecution, gang affiliation, or other law enforcement purpose.” Advocates say there is little transparency about the criteria and evidence used to justify ongoing separations.

Chloe Bryan,"Unless you're a professional masochist, there are very few good things about flying — especially if you're flying economy or basic economy. The only balm for your in-flight misery is often a single bag of pretzels and a half-can of soda. And that is why it's so devastating when the free snack and beverage offerings on your flight are... less than great. We want you to know what kind of snack situation (snacktuation) you're getting into when you fly, so we've evaluated and ranked each major U.S. airline by its complimentary snack and beverage offerings on domestic/North American flights. (We're sticking to the options for economy class, because that's where the snacks really count.) SEE ALSO: Costco food court items, ranked Remember: you can always ask for the full can of soda, even if they don't give it to you at first. 10. Allegiant Allegiant does not offer complimentary snacks or beverages on its flights. Also, it does not offer WiFi. Also, according to a FOIA request from 60 Minutes in April of this year, Allegiant flights are three-and-a-half times more likely to suffer an in-flight breakdown than flights operated by five of its competitors. But, hey, this is about snacks! 9. Spirit No free snacks. A wasteland. 8. Frontier Nothing is free. Your flight might be cheaper, though. Please pack a snack. 7. Southwest Southwest offers free peanuts and pretzels as well as the standard beverage service. Their coffee is from Community Coffee. It's all perfectly fine. Also, these cookies look good. 6. Alaska Alaska Airlines offers a standard beverage service, Starbucks coffee, and free pretzels and cookies. Not bad. 5. United United has abandoned the stroopwafel and is dead to me. (They did backtrack on tomato juice, though — is there hope yet?) Okay, fine. You can read about its snack offerings here. 4. Delta In its main cabin, Delta currently offers almonds, a pretzel-based snack mix, KIND Dark Chocolate Chunk bars, and Biscoff cookies. The greatest of these, of course, are the Biscoff cookies. (Ever had Trader Joe's cookie butter? They're that in solid form.) In the beverage department, they have Starbucks coffee and the standard soft drink selection. Not bad! 3. American Passengers on flights within North America get complimentary beverages (tea, coffee, juice, Coca-Cola products, etc.). The coffee is Illy, which is very good coffee. Best of all, though, American offers the aforementioned stroopwafel: two thin waffle cookies with a caramel sauce in between. The stroopwafel is the perfect morning plane snack, and here's why: when you receive your stroopwafel, you can place it atop the lid on your cup of Illy coffee. The caramel will melt slightly, and the cookie will become warm, rendering an already-delicious treat even better. Reader, I have bitten into the gooey center of a stroopwafel and felt my eyes fill with tears. And it wasn't because they were dry from plane air! The stroopwafel is the perfect morning plane snack. American also offers pretzels and nuts, which are less important. 2. JetBlue JetBlue has good snacks, particularly on the savory side of things. Unfortunately, they do not have stroopwafels or Biscoff cookies, but they do have pretzels, PopCorners chips, TERRA chips, chocolate chip cookies, and, most importantly, Cheez-its. Their coffee is from Dunkin' Donuts. Does anyone have strong feelings about Dunkin' Donuts coffee? I do not. It is fine, and it tastes like coffee. Here's the magical thing, though. JetBlue is also home to one of the greatest phenomena of modern day air travel: the snack zone. (Technically, it is called the ""Inflight Marketplace,"" but snack zone is a better name.) Available on longer domestic flights, the snack zone is an area between first class and coach where passengers can stop by and help themselves to more snacks and more drinks, even after the initial round of snacks and drinks has been served. The JetBlue flight from New York to LA is responsible for at least 75% of my Cheez-it consumption in the past year. Now, my body is composed of pure sodium! 1. Hawaiian Hawaiian Airlines is the only carrier on this list to offer a complimentary alcoholic beverage in the main cabin (a Koloa Breeze Rum Punch, according to a rep) on North American flights. Aside from that, they've got a standard beverage service, snack mix, and macadamia nut chocolate from Hawaiian Host or cookies from Honolulu Cookie Company, depending on from where your flight originates. Here's the kicker, though: Hawaiian serves complimentary meals to passengers in all cabins on transpacific flights. Could it finally be time to... get excited about airplane food? Damn. Hawaiian Airlines, you are powerful.","Unless you're a professional masochist, there are very few good things about flying — especially if you're flying economy or basic economy.

PETE WELLS,"He made a subspecialty of one street in particular. Ms. Reichl, who hired him at The Times and Gourmet, recalls his telling her in the 1980s that he had eaten every taco on Pico Boulevard. It was not just tacos. Eventually he wrote about his fascination with the street in a 1998 article that began, “For a while in my early 20s, I had only one clearly articulated ambition: to eat at least once at every restaurant on Pico Boulevard, starting with the fried yucca dish served at a pupuseria near the downtown end and working methodically westward toward the chili fries at Tom’s No. 5 near the beach. It seemed a reasonable enough alternative to graduate school.” In 2016, Ecco Press bought his proposal for a memoir which Mr. Gold called “a culinary coming of age book, I guess.” It was to be called “Breakfast on Pico.” Jonathan Gold was born on July 28, 1960, in South Los Angeles, where he was raised. His mother, Judith, was a school librarian who had been a magician’s assistant. Irwin Gold, his father, was a probation officer assigned to supervise Roman Polanski and Charles Manson, among other offenders. Jonathan later recalled eating Rice-A-Roni every Tuesday night and spending much of his childhood in his room, playing the cello. When he was old enough to fall under the influence of new wave, he plugged in his instrument and sawed away at it in the short-lived local band Overman. With cello proficiency in his favor, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles. Although he got his degree in music history, in 1982, he had a sideline in art; he took a class with and worked as an assistant for the guerrilla performance artist Chris Burden. For a brief time, Mr. Gold thought of himself as a performance artist, too. “A naked performance artist, to be specific,” he told an interviewer. His materials for one piece were two bottles of Glade air freshener, a pile of supermarket broiler chickens, a live chicken at the end of a rope and a machete wielded by Mr. Gold, who wore only a blindfold. The chicken survived, and may have come out of the ordeal in better spirits than Mr. Gold, who later said, “The few minutes after an art performance are some of the most depressing in the world.” While he was in college, Mr. Gold walked into the office of LA Weekly, an alternative paper, where he was soon reading proofs and pitching big, doomed ideas about the zeitgeist. For a time in the 1980s, he was the newspaper’s music editor, and by the 1990s he was better known as a music journalist than a food writer, contributing long articles to Spin, Details and other magazines. While reporting a Rolling Stone article about the emergence of gangsta rap, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg gave him a nickname: Nervous Cuz.","Jonathan Gold worked as The Los Angeles Times’s food critic for years, and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2007.

CHRISTOPHER BUSKIRK,"Senate candidates like Lou Barletta in Pennsylvania and Mike Braun in Indiana, who have embraced the rhetoric and the policies that connect citizenship and civic virtue, have seen it propel them to victory in their recent primaries. This is a salutary change from the last generation of Republican politicians who seemed to think that they could persuade voters with spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations. While appeals to narrow self-interest can work for a while, they eventually fall short because they ignore human nature. From Martha McSally in Arizona to Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, candidates are sharing this all-embracing message. That’s why Mr. Trump’s rhetoric works. When he speaks off the cuff, he talks about “we,” “us” and “our.” He has said repeatedly that we love our farmers, our police, our flag and our national anthem — even our coal miners. It is an odd construction, or at least one we’re not used to hearing. It speaks to the essential fraternity of the nation, but when Mr. Trump says it — maybe when any Republican says it — too many people don’t believe that they are included in the “our.” They hear something much narrower than what is meant. People reject the essentially wholesome message because of the messenger. That needs to change because they are, in fact, our farmers, our police and our coal miners, and we should love them. The bonds of civil union that ought to hold us together demand that we love our fellow citizens in their imperfection even as they love us in ours. This year’s class of Republican candidates seems to get that in ways that they didn’t in 2016. As a result, the Democrats’ advantage in the generic congressional vote dropped from 13 points in January, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, to 3.5 points at the end of May. A Reuters poll, which recorded a 14-point Democratic edge in April, gave Republicans a 6-point advantage last month. Apparently “resistance” and impeachment aren’t as popular as Democratic megadonors like Tom Steyer and their vassals would have Democratic candidates believe, although RealClearPolitics and Reuters now show Democrats with roughly an eight-point advantage. Ned Ryun, a veteran Republican activist, noted that the polls now closely mirror the polls in May 2014, when Democrats went on to lose 13 House seats. He also notes that while there are nearly 40 Republicans who are not seeking re-election, only six of them represent districts won by Hillary Clinton. Financially, Republicans are in much better shape, with the Republican National Committee holding $44 million in cash while the Democratic National Committee is $5 million in debt. There are even more cracks in the Democrats’ front line. Longtime Democrats like Mark Penn, a former Clinton pollster and confidant, are sick of the scandal mongering. Mr. Penn wrote recently that “Rather than a fair, limited and impartial investigation, the Mueller investigation became a partisan, open-ended inquisition that, by its precedent, is a threat to all those who ever want to participate in a national campaign or an administration again.” At some point, the combination of scandal fatigue — there is almost no crime of which Mr. Trump is not regularly accused — and the continuing revelations of improprieties by government officials (in the F.B.I., at the Department of Justice and elsewhere) will lead voters to believe that Mr. Trump got a raw deal.",Republicans should capitalize on their all-embracing notion of what it means to be American.,2018-06-09T01:04:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Opinion: If There’s a Red Wave Election in 2018, This Will Be Why",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/opinion/sunday/if-theres-a-red-wave-election-in-2018-this-will-be-why.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/10/opinion/10Buskirk2/10Buskirk2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-5,1
Sarah Perez,"Target this morning announced Target+, a new initiative designed to expand the assortment on Target.com with merchandise from third-party sellers. But unlike with Walmart and Amazon’s marketplaces, Target is taking a more curated approach as to how sellers will be added to its program. The retailer says it’s starting with “thoughtfully selected” additions in areas like home, toys, electronics and sporting goods.
While any seller can apply to join Amazon or Walmart’s marketplace, there’s no such process for joining Target+. Instead, Target explains that each partner is “carefully selected” and then invited into the program – a move it hopes will help keep quality high.
At launch, guests will be able to discover an expanded array of running shoes, outdoor décor, patio accessories, a bigger selection of STEM learning toys, new musical instruments, and baseball gear from both national and speciality sellers, says Target. Some of the current sellers include: SVSports, Mizuno, Kaplan Early Learning Company, Serenity Health &amp; Home Décor and Music123.
Over time, more products and sellers will be added, as Target learns more about guest needs.
Offering only a curated selection means Target+ won’t face the same struggles as other retailers when it comes to policing their third-party marketplaces for offensive content – like the racist merchandise found on Amazon, for instance; the toilet seat covers featuring holy text, politically charged and controversial apparel; and other items. Because these marketplaces are so large, offensive or just generally questionable or odd merchandise repeatedly surfaces, resulting in bad PR for the marketplace’s host, like Amazon, Walmart or eBay.
Target will avoid this issue by way of its curation, but it will come at the expense of having a larger third-party assortment.
Target+ merchandise will also be integrated into the site within the appropriate categories, so the items can be discovered through both browsing and search. There’s no way to just search for “Target+” items.
In addition, shoppers will have the same perks when buying from third parties as they do when buying from Target’s own assortment, including 5 percent off when using their Target REDcard, free shipping, and in-store returns.
Before Target+, a portion of Target’s assortment was shipped directly from third-party vendors, but guests were purchasing the items from Target. With Target+, products are purchased and shipped from the third-party vendors.
Guests look to Target for great products. With Target +, we aim to give them easy access to even more great products by partnering with best-in-class specialty and national brands that will help guests save and get more done in just one stop to Target.com,” said Rick Gomez, Targets chief marketing officer and digital officer, in a statement.
The launch of Target+ follows Walmart’s recent announcement that it would expand its 2-day shipping program to the millions of products offered by its own marketplace sellers, to better compete with Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows sellers to make their items available on Prime. And, like Target, Walmart aims to leverage its brick-and-mortar stores for third-party merchandise returns.
Both moves put Amazon at more of a disadvantage, as its brick-and-mortar footprint is limited to its Whole Foods stores, and various bookstores and other shops in urban metros. Walmart, on the other hand, has 140 million weekly in-store customers, and says 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store.
Target, meanwhile, has 1,850 retail stores in the U.S. compared with roughly 475 Whole Foods stores in the U.S., and over 4,700 Walmart locations in the U.S. (excluding Sam’s Club.)","Target this morning announced Target+, a new initiative designed to expand the assortment on Target.com with merchandise from third-party sellers.

Sarah Perez,"CBS is today launching another streaming network, this time focused on entertainment news. The service, which is called ET Live, was developed by CBS Interactive and CBS TV’s “Entertainment Tonight” news magazine, and will be available both as a standalone app as well as a part of the CBS streaming app aimed at cord cutters, CBS All Access. The new service will deliver 24/7 coverage of entertainment news, including breaking news, celebrity interviews, features, behind-the-scenes, red carpet coverage, plus trends stories across celebrity fashion, beauty and lifestyle. The content isn’t just a rehash of the “Entertainment Tonight” on-air broadcast, the network claims. Instead, it will feature original programming and a roster of new hosts, including Lauren Zima, Denny Directo, Cassie DiLaura, Tanner Thomason, Jason Carter and Melicia Johnson. The flagship show’s current hosts – Nancy ODell, Kevin Frazier, Nischelle Turner and Keltie Knight – will make regular appearances, however, to promote what’s up next and other exclusives. At launch, the service is available on its own website at ETLive.com and through an ET Live app on iOS, Android, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV, with more platforms expected in the future. It’s also being integrated into CBS All Access’s live feed across platforms, and as feed within CBSN, the network’s 24/7 streaming news service. The new streaming network is the latest of several launches aimed at bringing more CBS content to a new generation of viewers who no longer tune in to traditional pay TV. A few months ago, CBS debuted a portfolio of streaming services under the brand CBS Local. These help deliver local news to cord cutters and other digital media consumers, including its CBS All Access subscribers. It also operates news network CBSN, which it added to CBS All Access last year. And it launched streaming sports news service, CBS Sports HQ, earlier this year. This can now also be found in CBS All Access. Like CBSN, CBS Sports HQ, and your local CBS News (where available), the new ET Live feed is available in the “Live” section of the CBS All Access app. Users can toggle between the various live streams with a tap, then can choose to watch live or jump back to watch previous segments on-demand. ET’s brand made sense to be the next to transition to reach over-the-top viewers because of its existing reach, including on digital platforms. The TV show has nearly 5 million daily viewers, while the ETonline.com website averages 20 million monthly U.S. uniques, per comScore. Its social audience is even larger, with over 70 million U.S. users monthly, the network says. From CBS All Access to CBSN and CBS Sports HQ, we are dedicated to bringing consumers best-in-class streaming services, said Rob Gelick, Executive Vice President and General Manager, CBS Entertainment Digital for CBS Interactive, in a statement about the launch. ET Live is a natural expansion of our strategy and expertise in this area. We have the great advantage of being able to apply key learnings from our leading digital entertainment properties and marry that with the #1 entertainment brand in ‘Entertainment Tonight’ to create a new offering for the next generation of entertainment consumers, those that are platform-agnostic and expect content to be accessible anytime, anywhere,” he said.","CBS is today launching another streaming network, this time focused on entertainment news.

Alex Wilhelm,"More posts by this contributor Crunchbase News recently profiled a selection of U.S. companies largest VC raised in 2018, and no surprise here: the 10 largest rounds all topped out well north of $100 million. A major driver of global venture dollar growth is the relatively recent phenomenon of companies raising $100 million or more in a single venture round. Weve called these nine and 10-figure deals, which shine brightly in the media and are hefty enough to bend the curve of VC fund sizes upwards, supergiants after their stellar counterparts. And like stars, venture-backed companies tend to originate and co-exist in clusters, while the physical space between these groups is largely empty. We noticed that many of the companies behind these supergiant rounds are headquartered in just a few metro areas around the United States. In this case, its mostly just the SF Bay Area, plus others scattered between Boston, Los Angeles, San Diego and one ( Magic Leap ) in the unfortunately named Plantation, Florida. The San Francisco Bay Area is perhaps one of the best-known tech and startup hubs in the world. Places like Boston, NYC and Los Angeles, among others, are perhaps just as well-known. But how do these cities stack up as clusters for companies raising supergiant rounds? Superclusters That question got us wondering how these locales rank against other major metropolitan areas throughout the world. In the chart below, weve plotted the count of supergiant venture rounds 1 topping out at $100 million or more through November 5. These numbers are based off of reported data in Crunchbase, exclude private equity rounds and do not account for deals that may have already been closed but havent been publicly announced yet. Although U.S.-based companies have raised more supergiant rounds (168 year to date) than their Chinese counterparts (160 year to date), Chinese companies raise much bigger rounds, even at this supergiant size class. How much more? U.S. companies have raised $38.4 billion, year to date, in nine and 10-figure venture rounds alone. Chinese companies have raised $69 billion across their 160 supergiant deals, which includes the largest-ever VC deal: a $14 billion Series C round raised by Ant Financial. 2018 in perspective 2018 is already a record year for venture funding worldwide. With more than $275 billion in projected total venture dollar volume so far, 2018s year-to-date numbers have already eclipsed 2017s full-year figures (a projected $220 billion, roughly) by more than $55 billion. 2 And theres still about eight weeks left to go before its New Years Eve. We use the same classification rules for what is and is not a venture round as weve used in our quarterly reports. Check out the methodology section of our most recent global VC report, from Q3 2018, to learn more about how Crunchbase News categorizes rounds. Were referring to the same type of projected data we use in the quarterly reports.

Kieran Corcoran,"Hurricane Florence is surging towards the US, and could strengthen to Category 5 — the strongest class of storm — before it makes landfall. The storm is due to hit somewhere around North Carolina, according to the latest information from the National Hurricane Center, which predicts landfall early on Friday. Its latest prediction, published at 5 a.m. Tuesday, indicates that the eye of the storm is expected to hit the coast over Sneads Ferry, North Carolina. The area is home to around 10,000 people. A Google Street View image of an area close to Sneads Ferry, the area of the North Carolina Coast predicted to be hit by the storm. Google Street View The track had shifted 18 miles southward from an earlier advisory, which suggested that the storm would make landfall at Swansboro, North Carolina. Swansboro, of around 2,500 people, is close to the city of Jacksonville. National Hurricane Center predictions are not totally accurate, and the ""track"" of the storm, seen in the map below, could shift significantly. The center only predicts a few fixed points where they believe the storm will be, and the rest of the track is created by drawing straight lines between them. The likely destination of the storm is usually expressed as a cone to reflect this uncertainty.

Yoga requires a combination of a physical and mental strength and has been shown to improve flexibility, help with stress, and even lower blood pressure. It's something that a lot of us would love to get into, but can be slightly intimidating when we see expert yogis, like, balancing on top of a rock or something. (We're looking at you, stock photo girl.) If you've resolved try yoga for the first time or are just looking to attend more classes this year, check out this list of products that will make you look and feel like a certified yogi. SEE ALSO: A guide to wearable fitness trackers because there are literally too many to keep track of THE GEAR You probably could have guessed that you'll need a mat. Your hands, feet, and spine will be holding a lot of weight, so they'll need something to cushion them and prevent sliding. This thick, non-slip mat is an Amazon's Choice product and, according to the reviews, makes even the hardest poses feel steady. A convenient velcro carrying strap is also included for easy transportation. Get a grip (and ensure you don't slip and fall on your face) with a yogitoes towel. Made to go on top of your mat, these silicone dotted gripping towels help to prevent your feet from slipping around in sweat, especially during a super hard session. Balancing in yoga isn't an easy task, especially when starting out. Get a helping hand from these yoga blocks. Made of recycled, high density foam and available in six colors, these blocks are sturdy and perfect for at-home or in-class use. These durable yoga straps are another helpful accessory that can aid in trying new poses and deepening a stretch.

The leakproof Fresh Fusions 32 oz Water Bottle has a chamber that stretches to the bottom of the bottle, ensuring a fruity taste down to the last sip. Purchases also include an insulated travel sleeve and an eBook with 25 healthy recipes for infused water. THE CLOTHES Yoga positions require lots of stretching and bending, so clothes that won't restrict your movements are a necessity. Nordstrom has an awesome selection of yoga and barre exercise clothes for men and women, with tons of stylish patterns and fit options. Women's and men's athletic shoes from Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, and more are also available at Nordstrom. If have long hair or bangs, you'll also want a headband.

These yogi candles can help set the mood and give you an inspiration boost. The hand-poured soy candles are scented with essential oils and each correspond to a specific pose. If you're feeling a bit ""downward dog,"" a break for some tea may be the solution. This Yogi's Delight Tea Set is composed of caffeine-free organic herbal blends. Get inspired with the Deep Asana blend that aims to restore and energize, or the Pure Prana blend that's supposed to cleanse and revitalize. Many yoga teachers recommend that nervous beginners study some poses and methods at home before coming to class in order to prevent first time jitters — after all, yoga is supposed to be relaxing. This highly rated Yoga for Beginners DVD can help you get comfortable with all things yoga, including poses, meditation methods, and flexibility exercises.","Heads up: All products featured here are selected by Mashable's commerce team and meet our rigorous standards for awesomeness.

Jonathan Shieber,"More posts by this contributor March and April saw fresh VC in Africa, mobile money merge with social media, motorcycle taxis digitize, and TechCrunch in Nigeria and Ghana. Africa’s Talking with more VC Business APIs on the continent got a boost from global venture capital thanks to an $8.6 million round for Africa’s Talking —a Kenyan based enterprise software company. The new financing was led by IFC Venture Capital, with participation from Orange Digital Ventures and Social Capital. Africa’s Talking works with developers to create solution focused APIs across SMS, voice, payment, and airtime services. The company has a network of 20,000 software developers and 1000 clients including solar power venture M-Kopa and financial conglomerate Ecobank. Africa’s Talking operates in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Malawi, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania and maintains a private cloud space in London. Revenues come primarily from fees on a portion of the transactional business its solutions generate. The company plans to use the round to hire in Nairobi. It will also expand in other African geographies and invest in IoT, analytics, payments, and cloud offerings. CEO Samuel Gikandi and IFC Ventures’ Wale Ayeni offered insight on the round in this TechCrunch feature. M-Pesa the social network Kenya’s largest telco, Safaricom, rolled out a new social networking platform called Bonga, to augment its M-Pesa mobile money product. “Bonga is a conversational and transactional social network,” Shikoh Gitau, Alpha’s Head of Products, told TechCrunch. The new platform an outgrowth of the Safaricom’s Alpha innovation incubator. “[Bonga’s] focused on pay, play, and purpose…as the three main things our research found people do on our payment and mobile network,” Gitau said—naming corresponding examples of e-commerce, gaming, and Kenya’s informal harambee savings groups. Safaricom offered Bonga to a test group of 600 users and will soon allow that group to refer it to friends as part of a three-phase rollout. The platform will channel Facebook, YouTube, iTunes, PayPal, and eBay. Users will be able to create business profiles parallel to their social media profiles and M-Pesa accounts to sell online. Bonga will also include space for Kenya’s creative class to upload, shape, and distribute artistic products and content. Safaricom may take Bonga to other M-Pesa markets : currently 10 in Europe, Africa, and South Asia. The Bonga announcement came shortly after Safaricom announced a money-transfer deal with PayPal. TLcom’s $5M for Terragon Venture firm TLcom Capital made a $5 million investment in Nigerian-based Terragon Group, the developer of a software analytics service for customer acquisition. Located in Lagos, Terragon’s software services give clients — primarily telecommunications and financial services companies — data on Africa’s growing consumer markets. Products allow users to drill down on multiple combinations of behavioral and demographic information and reach consumers through video and SMS campaigns while connecting to online sales and payments systems, according to the company. Terragon has a team of 100 across Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and South Africa and clients across consumer goods, financial services, gaming, and NGOs. The company generates revenue primarily on transaction facilitation for its clients. Terragon bootstrapped itself into the black with revenues of $4 and $5 million dollars a year, CEO Elo Umeh told TechCrunch Uber and Taxify’s motorcycle move Global ride-hailing rivals Taxify and Uber launched motorcycle passenger service in East Africa. Customers of both companies in Uganda and Taxify riders in Kenya can now order up two-wheel transit by app. The moves come as Africa’s moto-taxis — commonly known as boda boda­s in the East and okadas in the West—upshift to digital. Taxify’s app now includes a “Boda” button and Uber’s a “uberBoda” icon to order up a two-wheel taxi transit via phone in respective countries. Other players in Africa’s motorcycle ride-hail market include Max.ng in Nigeria, SafeBoda in Uganda, and SafeMotos and Yego Moto in Rwanda. Both Taxify and Uber look to expand motorcycle taxi service in other African countries—full story here at TechCrunch. TechCrunch in Nigeria and Ghana And finally, TechCrunch visited Nigeria and Ghana in April. We hosted meet and greets at several hubs and talked with dozens of startup heads—including a few BFX Africa 2017 alumns, such as Agrocenta at Impact Hub Accra and FormPlus in Lagos.

Abac Cordero,"MANILA, Philippines — There’ll be fireworks inside the ring tonight when Filipino Donnie Nietes seeks a world title in a fourth weight class against Japan’s Kazuto Ioka in Macau.
“Bakbakan (slugfest) sa New Year,” Nietes’ trainer, Edito Villamor, told The STAR on the eve of the anticipated showdown for the vacant WBO super-flyweight crown.
The Wynn Palace Cotai will be the venue of the New Year’s Eve clash between two of the biggest names in the smaller weight division of 115 pounds.
Nietes was right on the dot when he tipped the scales yesterday while Ioka was a shade lighter at 114.5.
Villamor said Nietes, at 36 , still a force to reckon with, will climb the ring between 125 and 130 pounds.
“His training weight is 125 pounds. Doon siya comfortable,” added Villamor of Nietes, who hasn’t lost in 34 fights dating back to 2004.
Nietes has won world titles in the minimumweight, light-flyweight and flyweight divisions, and is hoping to add the super-flyweight crown to his collection. He has a ring record of 41-1-5 with 23 knockouts.
He took a shot at the same title last September but was held to a split draw by countryman Aston Palicte in Inglewood, California.
“Excited si Donnie. Ready na for a fourth world title,” said Villamor.
Like Nietes, the 29-year-old Japanese is trying to become a champion in a fourth weight class, having held world titles at 104, 108 and 112 pounds.",Nietes seeks 4th world title on New Year's eve vs Ioka Philippine Star There'll be fireworks inside the ring tonight when Filipino Donnie Nietes seeks a world title in a fourth weight class against Japan's Kazuto Ioka in Macau.

Noel Murray,"Arrested Development ’s fifth season doesn’t necessarily have to be its last. One of the most beloved, influential sitcoms of the 2000s has returned from the dead (or the near-dead) twice before: first when Netflix aired new episodes in 2013, seven years after Fox canceled the show, and then again in 2018, after creator Mitchell Hurwitz reconvened his busy cast, in hopes of satisfying the many fans disappointed with his more ambitious, experimental fourth season. The first eight episodes of season 5 arrived on Netflix last May. The final eight debut on the streaming service this Friday. Nothing has been announced about a potential season 6 — either pro or con. But c’mon. At this point, is there anyone out there who doesn’t think Arrested Development is done? After all, the first half of season 5 landed with a thud last year, generating surprisingly little buzz, aside from the terrible publicity generated by an awkward New York Times cast interview, which made an embarrassing public dispute out of the volatile on-set behavior of one of the show’s stars, Jeffrey Tambor. That interview happened not long after the Emmy-winning Amazon dramedy Transparent severed ties with Tambor, following an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of co-workers on the show. Some Arrested Development actors were ready to rally around their colleague… but not all were. So the cast may not be eager to work together again. That’d be a problem. Here’s a bigger one: based on its last eight episodes, the show isn’t worth continuing. Last year’s eight episodes weren’t great, but they weren’t terrible. But season 5’s second half essentially plays out the same storylines, many of which began during the underrated season four. Still, there’s no obvious reason why these episodes should be so painfully, tediously unfunny. Like the show’s previous seasons, the second half of season 5 contains too many subplots and running gags to cite. There are three main storylines: Bluth family patriarch George Sr. and matriarch Lucille are trying to save their construction business by building a Mexican-American border wall. Their son Michael tries to salvage both the family fortune and his relationship with his own son, George-Michael, by supporting George-Michael’s fraudulent privacy software company, Fakeblock. And Michael’s brother Buster tries to escape prosecution in a missing-persons case involving longtime family friend Lucille 2. Other long-running storylines get less screen time. The third Bluth brother, Gob, still wavers back and forth on whether he should say he’s gay, to help his magic career. His brother-in-law Tobias is still homeless and jobless, foraging for food and shelter with a couple of flighty actors, one of whom is his son. Tobias’ daughter Maeby is still posing as an elderly lady to take advantage of the facilities at an upscale senior living center. Maeby’s mother Lindsay disappeared midway through the season’s first half, and it’d be a spoiler to address any potential role she might have here. All these tangled, absurd narrative arcs are meant to serve two functions. Since its debut on Fox in fall 2003, Arrested Development has been a scathing satire of upper-class privilege, painting the Bluth family as self-absorbed, overconfident, underqualified boobs who’ve survived as long as they have due to an extremely lax moral code, plus American society’s deference to those who carry themselves as rich and important. In other words, this show was a parody of Trumpian arrogance long before the Trump family rose to political power. Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix This element of Arrested Development still mostly works. Perhaps because reality now seems freakier than fiction, the series’ takedown of the American aristocracy doesn’t feel as inspired or subversive as it did back in the early 2000s, when it was deflating the cockier George W. Bush-era swells. Nevertheless, jokes at the expense of clueless software magnates and opportunistic bigots still sting. But this show became a critics’ darling and cult favorite in its original run not just because of what it was about, but because of how Hurwitz and his creative team put their stories together. Drawing inspiration from The Simpsons, Mad magazine, and Wes Anderson movies, Arrested Development in the early going was a visual and aural marvel, with sight gags, puns, double-entendres, callbacks, and slapstick shtick filling nearly every second of screen time. And that’s what this series has lost. Not for lack of trying, understand. Arrested Development still aims to be manic and wacky. But like aging athletes losing their strength, Hurwitz and his cast and crew seem to have lost some of their speed and intensity. Their jokes lack the sharp snap and wicked curve of old. The root of all these ills may lie in the show’s much-maligned fourth season. When Netflix offered Hurwitz a chance to bring Arrested Development back, he faced a cast with irresolvable scheduling conflicts. So he completely reconceived his format, ditching the original seasons’ complicated, sprawling plotting in favor of more focused, character-driven episodes, each serving as tiles in a larger narrative mosaic. Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix The results were hit-and-miss. Some of those individual episodes (“Colony Collapse,” “Off the Hook”) are among the funniest in Arrested Development ’s entire run. Others are clunky and overstuffed. Either way, while Hurwitz still delivered an uncommonly sophisticated sitcom, even many of the season’s defenders noted that this wasn’t the same show. The crazy, intricate structure is too integral to the comic vision. So Hurwitz tried — too hard, in retrospect — to bring the old magic back, first by recutting season 4’s episodes into a more familiar Arrested Development form, then by following that project up with what was supposed to be a fifth-season return to “normalcy.” Yet these final eight episodes (and the eight that preceded them, for the most part) still feel off. Even with more of the cast sharing scenes, the episodes still seem cobbled together from moments caught on the fly between the actors’ other projects. Ron Howard’s narration — and some blatantly obvious post-production dubbing — has to do more work to connect all the dots. The end of season 5 isn’t a complete washout. Each episode features one or two quotably funny lines or memorably kooky ideas. (The best setpiece in this batch involves a stellar team of lawyers known as “The Guilty Guys.” It’s best for fans to experience the payoff for that themselves.) The MVPs of season 5’s first half were Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat, who’ve developed into distinctively soulful, effortlessly hilarious young actors. They’re both still a treat to watch, even when the material isn’t so good. Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix But what’s missing here, to a depressing degree, is a sense of purpose. Even the most respected, successful producers and writers don’t get that many opportunities to make TV shows. The best find a way to make the most of any vehicle, filling it with whatever themes or ideas or emotions have been on their minds. These last 16 Arrested Development episodes suggest Hurwitz has mainly been thinking about Arrested Development : perhaps pondering its glory days, wondering how to recapture them. This show has always been self-referential. Now, it’s downright solipsistic. In the years following Arrested Development ’s first cancellation, multiple single-camera sitcoms sprung up that adopted some of its style and sense of humor — most notably, NBC’s Emmy-winning hit 30 Rock. These days, fewer TV comedies work this vein. Even producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s 30 Rock follow-up Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt just aired its final episodes. This would’ve been a good time for Arrested Development to prove there’s still some pop in this old formula of complicated cringe-comedy with nested in-jokes. Instead, the creators have produced something so flat and stale, it may make fans wonder why they ever liked this series in the first place. If this does turn out to be how Arrested Development ends, then in a weird way, the show is going out making the same point it always has: just because a cultural institution has influence and a notable name, that doesn’t mean the executors know what they’re doing. The second half of Arrested Development season 5 arrives on Netflix on Friday, March 15th.","The second revival of Mitchell Hurwitz’s comedy darling of a show — starring Jason Bateman, Jeffrey Tambor, Michael Cera, Alia Shawkat, Tony Hale, and Will Arnett — concludes its fifth season with an eight-episode drop on Netflix on Friday, March 15th.

CHRISTOPHER CLAREY,"Madison Keys has advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open without dropping a set or even being pushed to a tiebreaker. Credit Darrian Traynor/Getty Images MELBOURNE, Australia — Since Madison Keys reached the Australian Open semifinals in 2015, this Grand Slam tournament has been all about pain. When she returned in 2016, she hobbled through a fourth-round defeat against Zhang Shuai and was in tears in the players’ lounge afterward, struggling to articulate her disappointment. Last year, she was unable to make the long journey to Melbourne at all, with her left wrist in a cast after surgery. Following the matches from afar was difficult. “I watched a handful, but it made me really sad, so I pretty much avoided ESPN, Tennis Channel, all of it,” she said on Monday as she answered questions on court in the Australian sunshine. But her mood and her power tennis are back on the upswing here, and if there were any lingering doubts about the state of Keys’s game, she dispelled them in a hurry in Rod Laver Arena by overwhelming the eighth-seeded Caroline Garcia, 6-3, 6-2. In the quarterfinals, Keys will face Angelique Kerber, the former No. 1-ranked player and the 2016 Australian Open champion, in what should be a compelling contrast in styles: Keys’s punching power against Kerber’s counterpunching athleticism. Kerber, seeded 21st but undefeated this season after winning the title in Sydney, was close to a surprise defeat on Monday before prevailing, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, against Hsieh Su-wei, the 88th-ranked Taiwanese veteran with an unconventional game. Hsieh, 32, had already upset No. 3-seeded Garbiñe Muguruza and No. 26-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska with her clever tactics, great defense, abrupt changes of rhythm and tightly angled shots struck double-handed off both sides. “That’s why the tennis is so interesting, because all the girls have different timing, different game,” Hsieh said. “Western style. Chinese style. One-hand. Double-handed. That’s why it makes tennis so fun.” She was one game away from bamboozling Kerber, too, but after Hsieh took a 6-4, 5-4 lead, Kerber held serve to 5-5 and got the better of a series of grueling, extended exchanges: howling with release as she crouched low to hit a forehand winner down the line to break Hsieh’s serve in the next game, taking command of the set and the momentum. “I was running everywhere and she always had the answer,” Kerber said on the court after closing out her ninth straight victory (13 if you count the Hopman Cup team event). “We will see a lot in 2018 from her, that’s for sure.” Asked about Kerber’s comment, Hsieh moved two fingers across her field of vision, à la John Travolta dancing in “Pulp Fiction.” “I’m coming,” she said with a smile. “So I will keep trying. Thank you.” Hsieh, who has won 19 doubles titles on the tour, had not reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the Australian Open in 2008. She calls her style “Su-wei style” or “freestyle.” “Like today, I go on the court, and if I don’t have a plan, then I do whatever I can,” she said. “When the ball comes, I decide at the last moment where to hit. So sometimes the girls say, ‘Oh I don’t know where she hit.’ But sometimes I don’t know where I hit, too.” Garcia, a 24-year-old from France who propelled herself into the top 10 late last season with a series of attack-minded victories in Asia, winning two tournaments in China and reaching the semifinals of the WTA’s year-end championships in Singapore. Angelique Kerber dispatched Hsieh Su-wei in three sets on Monday and will face Keys in the quarterfinals. Credit Edgar Su/Reuters A back problem forced her to retire during her first tournament of this year in Brisbane, Australia, but Garcia looked fit and confident heading into Monday’s duel. She opened the match by stepping inside the baseline to return aggressively, breaking Keys’s intimidating serve in the first game. But the 17th-seeded Keys bounced back to break Garcia, and then proceeded to play one of her finest matches in a major tournament. Keys, 22, reached her first major final at the United States Open last September but struggled to handle the moment, making errors in bunches and losing, 6-3, 6-0, to her compatriot and friend Sloane Stephens. “Pretty much the week to 10 days after was really tough,” Keys said. “I mean, my sleep schedule was totally messed up. I was just really tired from all the late, emotional matches that I had. And then to have such a great two weeks and then have it end the way that it did, it was really devastating for me. So it definitely took some time to get over.” Stephens has yet to win another match since that victory, and Keys played only one more match in 2017, losing to Varvara Lepchenko in the opening round in Wuhan, China, before deciding to end her season early to focus on getting her postoperative wrist in ideal shape to start 2018. But she also used her relatively long off-season to work on her conditioning, and it showed in the form of improved footwork, lateral speed and quickness against Garcia, who repeatedly tried to attack her traditional weaknesses without success. “There’s a sharpness about her,” said Sam Smith, the former British player, who is a television analyst for Seven Network in Australia. “She’s getting to the ball a fraction faster, and the setup is more precise. Hence she is making fewer unforced errors.” Keys still made 21 on Monday, but she also hit 32 winners, including nine aces, and managed to win the majority of the rallies, no matter what the length of the exchange. She said she was playing “really smart,” but when asked if this was a new step for her, her answer was polite but clear. “I don’t think so,” she said smiling. “I think I played pretty smart to get to the finals of the U.S. Open and win some titles. Hopefully it’s just a little bit more consistently that way.” Keys has had world-class power from the baseline since her midteens. It comes naturally, and it can be a double-edged sword as her flat strokes often leave her little margin for error. But Smith believes that Keys, under the guidance of her coach, Lindsay Davenport, is able to hit with more topspin on the backhand side now, creating more clearance when Keys needs it. “Each shot used to be an individual event,” Smith said. “But Lindsay Davenport has taught her how to play tennis.” Keys, identified long ago as a potential champion, has had no shortage of guidance during her career. Her ability to control her nerves as well as her power will be decisive as she chases her first Grand Slam title.

Roberto Baldwin,"""The idea is that we really have to develop a car today on a highly sophisticated level."" We're sitting in the automaker's latest research center built specifically for that highly sophisticated car. Or in BMW's case, two cars. One is the all-electric level 3 iNext that will be sold to the public. On the highway, the car should be able to drive itself under set circumstances. The other is a fleet vehicle with level 4 (and potentially level 5) capabilities that will be part of BMW's upcoming branded ride-hailing service. The automaker plans on delivering both of these vehicles in 2021. BMW has been erring on the side of caution when it comes to autonomy (I'm reminded of this multiple times while in Munich). Who can blame them with the recent Uber tragedy and Tesla Model S accident ? It's important to remember that cars are not phones or laptops or even electric push scooters. Sure the technology inside automobiles is advancing far quicker than ever, but automakers still have to produce software and hardware solutions that appease regulators and, more importantly, keep drivers safe. When a smartphone freezes up, you just restart it. When a car freezes up at 80 miles an hour on the freeway, it's suddenly an uncontrollable death machine. So whatever resources BMW wants to throw at autonomous car research are welcome. But making sure the automaker's 2021 plans (and beyond) come to fruition means it's decided to go all in on self-driving research. With that in mind, BMW opened its Autonomous Driving Campus near its headquarters in Munich, Germany, this week. The facility's 23,000 square meters (5.6 acres) will eventually accommodate 1,800 employees and 500 vehicles. While I attended the grand opening of the campus (that's still under construction), there are already employees at the site working. During a tour of one of the completed buildings, the automaker showed off how it plans to achieve autonomy in the future and change the way it works. Instead of a single team working on an entire system, sub-tasks (features of a system) are assigned to various departments to tackle problems in a fast-paced environment. BMW compared it to how startups work and touted how agile this will allow them to be. The automaker noted that since deploying its test fleet in California, it has racked up 24 million kilometers (14.9 million miles) in data. But 95 percent of those miles were tested in a proprietary BMW simulator using data from its test cars, Pegasus the open-source scenario database, and a scenario editor. The result is something that looks like a video game where researchers fine-tune edge case situations to see how BMW's AI reacts to certain events. Other companies like Mercedes, GM and Waymo also use simulators to test and train their AI. It's become an important part of the research. It's nearly impossible to encounter every situation while driving test vehicles. It's completely impossible to recreate and slightly tweak those situations to account for changing weather and road conditions and the presence of more (or fewer) vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. Of course, all the car data has to come from somewhere. During a sensor demonstration, BMW shared a new solid-state LiDAR system that it says has double the range and 2.5 times the resolution of what's currently on the road today. On its test vehicles, laser-based sensors are placed in the front center and sides and rear. The result should be a higher-quality image of a car's surrounding area than what we've seen in the past. Typically a sensor helps parse the objects it detects and passes it on to the vehicle's computer. BMW has decided to use the raw data directly from the cameras, LiDAR, radar, etc, combine it and do its own object detection. So instead of three pieces of hardware telling a computer if they see a person, the internal CPU uses the combined raw data to ""see"" a pedestrian. BMW also believes mapping is part of that data-gathering package. ""It's very important. We see it as a different sensor. With our onboard sensors, we are creating a live map of just what's happening around the car and we have a live map coming from Here,"" Dr. Wisselmann told Engadget. The live information and saved map data are overlaid to make sure the car is where it says it is. Nokia's Here maps was acquired by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015. Mercedes uses it to for Active Distance Assist Distronic on the new S-Class to slow a car down if the map determines an upcoming corner is too sharp for the car's current speed. BMW's iNext won't be the first level 3 car available for purchase. That distinction goes to Audi's 2019 A8. Unfortunately, there are regulatory issues that determine when and where the technology can be deployed. BMW is hoping by 2021 countries (and states) will have figured out how to accept vehicles like the iNext and A8. Meanwhile, the automaker is determining how to actually navigate the autonomous future. The new Autonomous Driving Campus is not just a solid step in the right direction, it's a huge leap both financially and in how it builds cars generally. If an automaker isn't working on this issue, it risks being left behind. BMW wants to make sure it does this right. It wants to be cautious. Seriously, they told me that over and over again. But that's important. Not just for the automaker but for the entire industry. Being careful about introducing these types of features keeps drivers safe and cars out of headlines. BMW is known for fast cars. But fast doesn't necessarily mean unsafe and a giant facility dedicated to making sure its first self-driving cars are conservative on the roads is a good thing.","Dr. Dirk Wisselmann, senior expert for autonomous driving at BMW, tells me that the automaker's first level 3 car will have the technical capabilities for level 4 or 5 highway driving.

Rakesh Goswami,"The agitation by the Gujjar community demanding five per cent quota in jobs and educational institutes turned violent in Dholpur district on Sunday as shots were fired and three police vehicles torched. The police said protesters pelted stones, injuring four people. The police had to lob tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. Here’s an explainer on the quota stir:
Who are Gujjars?
It is a pastoral community. As per the 1931 caste census, Gujjars constitute about 5% of Rajasthan’s population. They are present in around 21 districts. Traditionally, they have been BJP supporters.
What is their demand?
They are demanding 5% reservation under special backwards classes (SBC) category. The community began its fight for reservation in 2006 when it demanded inclusion in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) reservation. The Gujjars were covered under OBC reservation since 1994. After the Chopra Committee report said Gujjars could not be given ST status, the community settled for 5% reservation under a new SBC category. But because this took the total reservation in the state beyond the 50% ceiling set by the Supreme Court, the Rajasthan high court quashed it.
Has any government given them 5% SBC quota?
Yes. The Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government in 2008 brought a bill for 5% SBC reservation to Gujjars and four other communities (Banjara/Baldia/Labana, Gadia-Lohar/Gadalia, Raika/Rebari and Gadaria). The HC stayed the law on December 22, 2010, and asked the state to present quantifiable data to support reservation under SBC.
The government later repealed the 2008 Act and introduced a new bill in Assembly in September 2015, called the Rajasthan Special Backward Classes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutes in the State and of Appointments and Posts in Services under the State) Bill, 2015.
 A notification for this was issued on October 16, 2015. Rajasthan HC struck it down on December 9, 2016 on the ground that the 5% reservation crossed the 50% limit for quota in education and jobs.
The Rajasthan government brought a bill in Assembly in 2017 to raise the other backward class (OBC) quota from the present 21% to 26% for granting 5% reservation to Gujjars and other castes. This, too, was struck down by the high court.

What is the current status of reservation in Rajasthan?
Currently, they can avail 1% reservation under most backward class (MBC) category apart from the benefit of OBC reservation. Reservation in the state stands at 50% – 16% to SC, 12% to ST, 21% to OBC and 1% to Gujjars.
Is this the first time Gujjars have blocked train traffic?
No. In May 2008, they laid siege to the Delhi-Mumbai rail route at Pilukapura near Bayana in Bharatpur district. They lynched a cop near the rail line leading police firing that claimed 15 lives. The next day, more Gujjars were killed in police firing in Sikandara in Dausa district.
They blocked the tracks in Pilukapura in December 2010 and May 2015 also but there was no violence.
In May 2007, Gujjars blocked Agra-Jaipur national highway at Peepalkheda and Patoli. 28 people were killed in police firing.
So far, the Gujjars have lost more than 70 people to police firing and clashes with the Meenas, who were opposing their demand for ST status in 2007.
Who is leading them?
Colonel (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla has been leading the community since 2006 when they uprooted railway tracks in Hindaun City in Karauli district. Colonel Bainsla, 85, contested 2009 Lok Sabha election on BJP ticket and lost by 317 votes. In February 2019, his son Vijay Singh Bainsla also became part of the agitation as his deputy.

Chris Velazco,"LG After some missteps and false starts, last year's G6 was proof that LG's smartphones are far from irrelevant. Too bad we're not getting at G7 at MWC this year. LG seems to enjoy spoiling its own surprises, so it confirmed we'd see an updated version of last year's V30 that'll probably be called the V30S. From what we've heard, it's mostly the same V30 we reviewed last year, just fleshed out with new AI features to make the cameras a little more capable. (Personally, I hope LG also used better screens for this updated model.) LG's Vision AI is supposed to help the V30 and future devices scan QR codes, perform image searches and provide shopping links for things the camera sees. If this sounds familiar, well, it should -- this sound conceptually familiar to the Bixby Vision feature Samsung baked into its S8s and Note 8s. Given the V30's impressive photographic chops, it's no surprise the Vision AI should help when taking photos. Vision AI was also trained on over 100 million images to help it better understand what it sees, and as a result, the camera can switch to a shooting mode appropriate for what's in front of it. This updated V30 will also get a slew of new voice commands for Google Assistant, marking the first time a smartphone maker has cooked up custom Assistant commands. Not only will the new V30 know to fire up food mode when you're snapping photos of your lunch -- you'll be able to ask it to snap the photo, too. Here's hoping we get some clarity on LG's upcoming flagship phone (code-named Julie) as well, but that probably won't happen for at least a few more months. Sony Sony has managed to avoid major MWC leaks so far, but it recently teased fans with a short video that suggests at least one curvy new Sony phone is coming to Spain. That seems like a clear sign that Sony is moving away from its long-running OmniBalance design language, and frankly, good riddance. Sony phones have mostly looked like the same ol' slabs for years, and enough is enough. Unfortunately, we don't have much detail on what this curvaceous new phone has going for it. Rumors of a so-called XZ Pro have been making the rounds for a while, though. If true, it'll be a new flagship-class device with a 5.7-inch, 4K OLED display and one of Qualcomm's fresh-off-the-line Snapdragon 845s. It might also be the first Sony phone on the market with a dual camera, and if that's the case, we're looking forward to seeing how Sony's implementation differs from all the others. We might also get to see an updated version of the company's Xperia Ear, if only because Sony has a solid track record of turning its wacky concepts into real products. BlackBerry Mobile It's been a long strange ride for BlackBerry fans, but 2018 should be a good year for the brand's diehard fans. Back at CES, execs told us to expect at least two smartphones with physical QWERTY keyboards this year, and with any luck, we'll get our first look at the show. If rumors hold true, one of those devices might be a spiritual, sliding successor to 2015's BlackBerry Priv with a curved screen, and we'd expect the other to be some sort of BlackBerry KeyONE follow-up. Other details are scarce at the moment, but we have seen some new codenames being thrown around lately -- BlackBerry Uni sounds pretty... awful, but we wouldn't mind spending some time with a BlackBerry Athena or Luna. Alcatel Don't forget about TCL's other smartphone brand, either. The company showed us a few of its redesigned phones at CES, but they were far from finished at the time -- we expect these new 1, 3 and 5 series phones to be ready to launch very soon. They're meant to be inexpensive machines, so there hasn't been too much hype surrounding them, but they're proof that you'll be able to get phones with 18:9 screens without making your wallet groan. Lenovo &amp; Motorola We go to MWC expecting to spend all our time with smartphones, but Lenovo always seems to have some Windows machines to show off; you'd do well to expect a notebook announcement before the week is over. The big question is whether Lenovo will show off new, always-connected PCs -- you know, the ones powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipsets -- or just the usual Intel-powered fare. We're tentatively leaning towards ""no"" since the Miix 630 is still so new, but hey -- we can hope right? Meanwhile, Lenovo's Motorola brand has been awfully quiet in the run-up to the show. That just might be because it had to deal with the mother of all leaks earlier this year. You can expect big updates for its G, X, and Z-series devices this year -- we're just not sure about when, or if they'll all be announced at MWC. Last year, Moto showed off new Moto Gs, so news of some follow-ups seems like a safe bet. But what's actually new? Well, the Moto G series is expected to get dual cameras across the board and a glossy redesign to make it look more like the existing Moto X4. The updated X series, meanwhile, should pack a 5.9-inch, 18:9 screen with an iPhone X-style notch that hides a pair of front-facing cameras. And the Z series? Well, it should still play nice with existing Moto Mods, but leaked images suggest the new Z phones will have 6-inch, curved displays. Here's hoping we hear about some new Moto Mods, especially that long-rumored 5G radio Mod. With 5G network trials slated for later this year, we'll need news sooner than later.

Tom McKay,"Facebook, the scandal-mired social media giant that has faced enormous criticism for its role in the spread of online propaganda and fake news across the globe, has a War Room it wants everyone to know is tackling that issue head-on. Earlier this month, it touted the War Rooms efforts to clean up a torrent of hoaxes and misinformation spreading across Brazil on Facebook subsidiary and encrypted chat service WhatsApp before the countrys October 28 runoff election. Its head of civic engagement, Samidh Chakrabarti, told reporters the company was delighted to see how efficient we were able to be, from point of detection to point of action. Status update: On Sunday, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro who has pledged support for Brazils two-decade military dictatorship, attacked minorities and LGBTQ people, backed torture, and reportedly plans to decimate the Amazon rainforest won those elections with 55.2 percent of the vote. And it looks an awful lot like one key element of his victory was exactly the kind of stuff the War Room was supposedly intended to fight, especially on WhatsApp. WhatsApp is enormously popular in Brazil, where it has essentially supplanted other communication services, and its group chat feature is widely used for organizing and political discussions. There are a huge number of factors that contributed to popular disaffection with the Brazilian government, and Bolsonaros rise to the presidency and the apps encrypted, decentralized nature make policing abuse difficult. But WhatsApp spam and propaganda has been widely reported to have been a dominant force in the final stretch of the campaign season. This month, a scandal broke when the Folha de São Paulo paper alleged that top business supporters of Bolsonaro illegally bankrolled a WhatsApp spam campaign. Reports of WhatsApps role in the election are everywhere. Take this interview on Vox with State University of New York at New Paltz anthropology professor Benjamin Junge, a Fulbright fellow studying working-class and middle-class families at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil: Facebook and WhatsApp are [where we see] the fake news issue. A couple of weeks ago this matriarch who Ive been talking about, we bumped into each other, and Im always bugging them with questions about the election. This was before the first round of elections. She showed me a picture of this clip that was circulating of some woman in some public space who took her shirt off and bared her breasts. She shows this to me and says, I dont want this kind of a society, is this what we want? And I said, Wait a minute, who is this person? And she says, This is what we would get if we support the [Workers Party], or at least this is what will be fixed if Bolsonaro gets elected. And it was just some ridiculous fake news thing, who knows if it was actually the Bolsonaro people who put it into circulation, but it was circulated by Bolsonaro supporters Junge added:... I dont even fully appreciate just how pervasive WhatsApp groups areI think that every family in Brazil has a WhatsApp group that has more than one cellphone user in it. And I believe that that cuts across class in a big way. From the New York Times on Bolsonaros digital-first strategy: While rivals spent small fortunes on marketing firms, video editors and consultants, Mr. Bolsonaro relied primarily on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to communicate with voters and expand his base.... One dominant message, spread widely via WhatsApp, asserted with no evidence that Mr. Bolsonaros opponents encouraged schoolchildren to become gay or reconsider their gender identity by employing sex education materials referred to as gay kits. I like what Bolsonaro stands for, said Cintia Puerta, 55, an architect in São Paulo, said Sunday after voting. My sister works in a school so I know they are teaching gay kits to children, teaching them about sexuality at age 5 and 6. Theyre indoctrinating children in the school. From the Washington Post, on how online fanbases fueled Bolsonaros rise: Though it surged only over the past two months, the Bolsonaro phenomenon began to take off two years ago, observers say. His popularity built in urban areas, where backers became voracious consumers of his missives on Twitter and WhatsApp. It spread to ranchers suffering invasions of squatters on rural farms. White men and wealthy voters, eager to turn the page after a decade of left-wing rule, rallied to Bolsonaros side. His rise caught many off guard. Okay, heres the Guardian from shortly before the election: Bolsonaros loyal volunteer army administer the WhatsApp groups and stand ready to ban infiltrators or anyone who dares question their leader. There is little debate or discussion of Bolsonaros electoral manifesto, but users are often expelled for apparently trivial infractions such as asking why Bolsonaro has refused to participate in televised debates. Whenever average users attempt to ask questions, they are bombarded by passionate messages from Bolsominions, who often base their arguments on fake news stories. Indeed, Bolsonaros most passionate supporters form a human infrastructure that actively disseminates fake news across social media platforms. The Rio Times, also from a few days before the elections, noted that the misinformation was so pervasive that Bolsonaros opponents got in on the game: A large number of Brazilians, especially of women, adhered to the #EleNao (#NotHim) and #EleNunca (#NeverHim) movement against Bolsonaro, calling him a racist, anti-LGBT, chauvinist dictator. Over the past weekend the movement held rallies throughout the country, taking thousands to the streets. Many Brazilians, like graphic designer Flavia Ribeiro, admit to posting videos and information which may not be true in her social media, but justifies the move as just equaling the playing field. Bolsonaros supporters play dirty, they are very aggressive on Whatsapp and Facebook, telling all sorts of lies about the PT, (former president) Lula and Haddad, she says. Im just putting out information that I receive against Bolsonaro, but I dont always check to see if its true. As Vice News noted on the eve of the election, WhatsApp CEO Chris Daniels published an op-ed in Folha saying, We have a responsibility to amplify the good and mitigate the bad this month. But WhatsApp, which has no staff located in Brazil, failed to send an in-person representative during a meeting at the Superior Electoral Court in Brasilia last week: Rather, Keyla Maggessy, WhatsApps senior manager working on law enforcement and safety, video-conferenced in from her office in Silicon Valley. The companys failure to attend in person was compounded by what fact-checkers present in the meeting described as Maggessys lack of knowledge on the subject. Every question we put to her, she either didnt know how to answer or she was going to ask somebody else, said Christina Tardáguila, director of fact-checking group Agência Lupa, who attended the meeting. Others in the room had some jabs as well, Vice News added: The other, Tai Nalon, director of Aos Fatos, Brazils oldest fact-checking network, said Maggessy wrongly claimed that WhatsApp had been working in partnership with her group. You may have a partnership with me, but I dont have a partnership with you, Nalon said. Sounds like that War Room went just great! Hopefully, when Dr. WhatsApp or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Fake News, goes to DVD, theyll leave in the deleted pie fight scene.","Facebook, the scandal-mired social media giant that has faced enormous criticism for its role in the spread of online propaganda and fake news across the globe, has a War Room it wants everyone to know is tackling that issue head-on.

Jacob Passy,"Private air travel is becoming more common around the world as the number of people with access to large amounts of wealth grows. But that doesn’t mean flying private is necessarily the best option when it comes to air travel. Indeed, commercial airlines like Qantas QAN, +4.13% are stepping up their game by developing in-flight gyms and sleeping pods, amenities that aren’t as easy to come by for private jets. Consequently the decision between the two is becoming less and less clear. “You have to put a value to your money and time,” said Tahsir Ahsan, senior writer at travel website Travelcodex. “As airlines are coming out with better options for business and first class, it’s getting harder to decide between private and first class travel.” Here are some of the ways that flying in first or business class can be a better experience than traveling via private jet. Don’t miss: How to fly on a private jet for under $150 per person You don’t necessarily receive all the bells and whistles you get in first class Anywhere from 15% to 17% of chartered private planes don’t even have wireless internet, said Doug Gollan, luxury travel expert and editor of travel website Private Jet Card Comparisons. Meanwhile, most major airlines offer Wi-Fi on domestic flights, and some even offer it on transatlantic routes. Plus, many airlines, including Etihad and Lufthansa LHA, +1.82% are making it free for first- or business-class passengers. Adding Wi-Fi to a plane is very costly to the owner, so many private jet owners will decline to do so. Or they may disable the service when they lease out their planes to charter companies to avoid high telecommunications bills, Gollan said. “People have the perception that Wi-Fi is a given because you get it on commercial airlines,” he said. “It’s not a given.” Dana Zucker, owner of lifestyle website LifeDoneWell.today, travels both on private jets and with commercials airlines. And part of what draws her to flying in business or first class, rather than private, at times is the consistency of the amenities that are offered. When a consumer is flying private from “Kansas in the middle of the foothills,” Zucker said, it’s less likely that the food served on-board will be the same quality as you would get out of New York. Moreover, Zucker said the ability to research the amenities offered makes it easier to compare airlines and get the best possible experience. “We’re booking a trip to Alaska, and I’m choosing DAL, -2.14% over Alaska Airlines ALK, -2.16% because I know what wine they serve,” she quipped. It’ll be easier to book at peak times of the year If someone owns their own plane, then it’s at their disposal whenever. But those who are turning to charter companies for private air travel, or even those who co-own an aircraft, may be disappointed when it comes to their options during peak travel periods. “Aircraft may be very difficult to charter (and more costly) during holidays and other peak usage periods,” Deloitte wrote in a report analyzing the benefits of flying private. Even if you own a plane, you won’t be able to fly to China easily One of the biggest hurdles for the private aviation industry isn’t supplying enough planes to keep up with demand — it’s the actual infrastructure of airports. Although East Asia — and China especially — has one of the fastest-growing populations of ultra-high net worth individuals, its infrastructure for private aviation is sorely lacking. Also read: Barbara Corcoran says she’s ‘too cheap’ to pay for first class Though the Asia Pacific region has nearly as many ultra-high net worth individuals as Europe at this point, it only had 1,186 private jets, according to a recent report on private aviation from Wealth-X, a firm that specializes in researching ultra-high net worth individuals, and private jet charter company VistaJet. That’s far fewer than the number of private jets in Europe (2,795), North America (13,392) and Latin America (2,596). The problem: There are far fewer smaller airports in China. Smaller airports are not only more convenient for private jet travelers, but they’re also much cheaper to fly in and out of than the hubs in major cities, said Winston Chesterfield, director of custom research at Wealth-X. “You need the infrastructure for these airports to take off literally, before you can push the private aviation market further,” Chesterfield said. The networking can be better when flying commercial Many opt for private air travel in order to avoid the crowds at major airports. But flying in first- or business-class on a commercial airline means that a traveler will have a decent chance of bumping elbows with another successful businessperson. “The first-class areas are the ultimate networking rooms,” marketing expert and author Joel Comm wrote for Inc magazine. Flying commercial will cost less The most obvious upside to flying on a commercial airline is the lower cost. Flying one-way between New York and Los Angeles on a chartered light jet through Air Charter Services USA, for instance, could cost anywhere from $33,000 to $52,500. A one-way ticket on United Airlines UAL, -2.91% in first-class meanwhile could cost as little as $659. “Commercial air travel will always be a better bang for your buck,” Ahsan said. “One-way private jets across the country can cost as much as 15 round-trip first class tickets on that same route.” And the frequent-flier rewards programs from most airlines can make flying private even more economical for those who must travel often, particularly if they can get an upgrade. Looking at cost another way though, flying with a commercial airline will also result in a smaller carbon footprint. Flying private may generate up to 37 times more carbon emissions than traveling on a commercial airlines, according to one estimate. Still, flying private has its own clear benefits For all the ways in which flying in an upgraded class on a commercial airline may offer a better value than private air travel, the private experience does have clear benefits, not even considering the luxury amenities that typically are offered onboard these flight. Flying private offers much more flexibility and time-savings. For instance, travelers can choose to fly to or from virtually any airport, meaning they can fly out of the airport closest to them and ensure a direct route from a smaller airport when they otherwise might need to endure a layover. Plus, the security process at smaller airports will be less involved — or at the very least faster. After all, there will be fewer people jockeying to get through the metal detectors.",Flying private has its benefits — but isn’t necessarily all it’s cracked up to be.,2018-04-07T08:48:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",5 ways flying first class is actually better than flying in a private jet,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-ways-flying-first-class-is-actually-better-than-flying-in-a-private-jet-2018-04-07,http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG942_firstc_ZG_20180406155042.jpg,,Marketwatch.com,class-5,1
Ryan Pickrell,"The embattled Zumwalt-class destroyers still don't have any ammunition, but the US Navy has an idea, or at least the beginnings of an idea. 
 The Navy has invested hundreds of millions of dollars and more than a decade into railgun research, which has run up against several technological roadblocks, but while the railgun may not turn out to be a worthwhile project, the railgun rounds seem to show promise. 
 The Navy fired nearly two dozen hyper velocity projectiles (HVPs) — special rounds initially designed for electromagnetic railguns — from the Mk 45 five-inch deck gun aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Dewey at one point during last year's Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises, USNI News first reported. The guns are the same 40-year-old guns that come standard on cruisers and destroyers.

Read More:The US Navy reportedly fired new hyper velocity railgun rounds out of 40-year-old deck guns — here's why
 The same concept could presumably be applied to the 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers. ""That is one thing that has been considered with respect to capability for this ship class. We're looking at a longer-range bullet that's affordable, and so that's one thing that's being considered,"" Capt. Kevin Smith, a program manager for the Zumwalt, revealed at the Surface Navy Association Symposium, USNI News reported Tuesday. 
 ""The surface Navy is really excited about this capability,"" he added, noting that nothing has been decided. 
 This is apparently only one of several possibilities. ""There are a lot of things that we're looking at as far as deeper magazines with other types of weapons that have longer range,"" Smith explained. Previous considerations have included the Raytheon Excalibur 155 mm guided artillery, but that plan was abandoned.

Read More:The destroyer Zumwalt's big guns don't have any ammo, and the Navy may ditch them entirely because they don't even work right
 The Zumwalt's 155mm AGS guns, intended to strike targets farther than 80 miles away, are ridiculously expensive to fire, as a single Long Range Land Attack Projectile costs almost $1 million. Procurement was shut down two years ago, leaving the Zumwalt without any ammunition. 
 Since then, the Navy has been looking hard at other alternatives. 
 The Navy ""will be developing either the round that goes with that gun or what we are going to do with that space if we decide to remove that gun in the future,"" Vice Adm. William Merz, the deputy chief of naval operations for warfare systems, told the Senate Armed Services seapower subcommittee in November, Breaking Defense reported at the time. 
 So, if the Navy can't find suitable ammunition for the stealth destroyers, it may end up scrapping the guns altogether to be replaced with something else down the road. 
 Despite repeated setbacks, which include everything from loss of stealth to engine and electrical problems, the Navy insists ""the ship is doing fine."" Merz told Congress that the vessel should be operational by 2021.","The Navy is considering arming the ammo-less Zumwalt destroyers with hyper velocity railgun rounds.

Stephanie Schomer,"September 4, 2018 5 min read In the Women Entrepreneur series My First Moves, we talk to founders about that pivotal moment when they decided to turn their business idea into a reality -- and the first steps they took to make it happen. You might not know Lauren Kleban, but you definitely know her clients. Celebrities including Emmy Rossum and Busy Phillips have become fans and genuine brand advocates of LEKFit, the dance-inspired fitness method Kleban, a trained professional dancer, developed to satisfy her own workout cravings. What started as a side hustle following the birth of her first child has blossomed into a fitness craze, attracting women from Hollywood and well beyond. Here’s how Kleban did it. 1. Solve your own problem. The early part of Kleban’s career was as a professional dancer, but after she became a mom, life on the road as part of a tour was no longer a stable option. “I started teaching dance at studios in Los Angeles, and I always found myself doing multiple workouts,” Kleban says. “I’d teach a class, then go to Runyon Canyon for a run. I never felt like I was getting enough, but I also didn’t have time, as a mom, to spend two hours working out every day.” So she set out to create a fitness program that would serve all her needs -- in under an hour. She wanted to fuse the benefits she got from both ballet or yoga and running, in one contained class. “That’s where the rebounder came in,” Kleban says of the mini trampoline her workouts utilize. Once she found a formula she liked, she’d test it out on her fitness clients. RELATED: The Founder of Miss Jessie's Got Retail Placement by Asking a Stock Boy for Intel. 2. Find a home base -- anywhere you can. As her program developed, Kleban realized that there was a larger desire for these kinds of workouts than she had even anticipated, and she and her husband agreed to give it a go and invest in the program as more than just a side hustle. “We moved to a new house in Hollywood and intentionally bought a property with a yard that could accommodate a trampoline,” she says. “We built out a space for classes without really knowing what was going to happen.” The classes started maxing out -- fast. “The studio is in our garage and the guestroom is the dressing room, waiting area, and shower,” Kleban says. We’ve already had to revamp the space a few times.” 3. Ignore the naysayers. Given the high demand of her classes -- which accommodate a small number of clients, about nine per class -- Kleban was eager to find ways to reach more people. “My husband has a tech background and suggested putting the content online,” Kleban says. But plenty of people advised her against it. “People in the health space, other entrepreneurs, was like, ‘Don’t put it online, that’s a horrible idea!’ But we did it anyway -- and it was immediately crazy and has grown ever since. And we’ve done zero paid advertising.” Streaming the classes helped reach women far outside of L.A., and thanks to some celebrity clientele that regularly post videos from Kleban’s in-person classes to social media -- Busy Phillips is a well-known devotee -- fervor for LEKFit rapidly grew beyond the Hollywood Hills. RELATED: How This Founder Bootstrapped an Office Furniture Company That Targeted What Other Furniture Companies Are Missing. 4. Troubleshoot. Putting workout classes online, however, is easier said than done, and perfecting the model took a lot of trial and error. “At first it was just me facing the camera, and we quickly realized that people don’t want that,” Kleban says. “We also did short pieces of content, thinking people would want to piece their own workouts together. But they didn’t want that either.” Kleban and her husband brought in a proper production manager, lit the studio and started filming 50-minute classes from beginning to end, capturing the participants in addition to Kleban and her growing roster of instructors. 5. Expand your operation when the time (and location) is right. “At this point, there are people walking through my backyard that I don’t know,” Kleban says about her homegrown business. Now the mother of two, she’s ready to move the operation outside of her home and is preparing to open the company’s first flagship location in Los Angeles -- and spent a long time hunting for the perfect spot. “Parking in L.A. is a very big deal, and it’s very difficult, and there are different laws in different areas,” she says, laughing. “We’ve been in deals and found out there was no parking, and we’ve found spaces that appear to have parking, but the actual lot was sold 25 years ago. So we had to keep going until we found what made sense for us and our clients.” RELATED: The Founder of a Macaron Bakery Used Her Past Experience as a Photo Editor to Build Her Instagram-Ready Brand. 6. Never stop evolving. Kleban changes the content of her classes every week. “The concept stays the same, but the content is fresh,” she says. “I test [each new class] on my Saturday classes, to make sure that people are happy and that the workout feels good. We shoot it, upload it and it’s ready for viewers on Wednesday morning.” And the cycle never stops.","Lauren Kleban's fitness classes are beloved by Hollywood tastemakers, but she found a larger audience by filming and streaming her content.",2018-09-04T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How the Founder of Fitness Craze LEKFit Built a Business From Her Backyard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/318932,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20180823173509-LEKfit-25.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,class-5,1

Whether you’re looking to spend your time listening to music outside, or you’re in search for the perfect indoor music solution, or both, there are hundreds of smart speakers for you to choose from. For something entry-level with enough sound to fill a small room, perhaps DOSS, an Amazon bestseller priced at $29, is a good choice. If you prefer something more high-end that fills your entire home with premium sound, consider the Multiroom Audio System bundle at $349. SEE ALSO: Reviewers love HomePod's loud, bass-y sound, but hate how dumb Siri is And that's just scratching the surface. You could spend all day scouring product descriptions and review sections to find the best fit, but we won't make you do that. We've done the hard work for you. Here are some of the best-rated smart speakers on Amazon. You can thank us later. At 4.1 stars, customers ranging from audiophiles to casual listeners say it’s loud when it needs to be and quickly surpassed their expectations. There are eight speakers in the B&amp;O play lineup and the A1 is the smallest. Image: Sonos Despite its compact size, the Sonos One can fill two rooms with deep, rich audio. It comes with two Class-D amplifiers for continuous sound without interruption or dropouts. The 3.5-inch mid-woofer was designed to deliver deep bass that Amazon reviewers responded well to. SEE ALSO: Read more about the Sonos One on Mashable You control everything using the Sonos app, which consolidates all of your music libraries and playlists. You can play the same song throughout your home or customize the speakers to play a different track in each room. This Amazon best-seller can also be connected to any Alexa-enabled device so you can control the speakers with the sound of your voice. 44 percent of customers gave the Sonos One 5 out of 5 stars on Amazon. We suspect you will too. If you’re looking for a tiny speaker to throw in your bag and take with you, this one by Sony is a perfect fit. This speaker is designed with extra bass in mind. A passive radiator works with the internal speaker to enhance low-end bass response, giving it a boost. So deep bass that’s usually nonexistant with smaller speakers isn’t lost with the Sony XB10. There is a single driver that faces up for 360-degree sound, or you can turn the speaker toward you for more direct listening. It is neither shockproof nor fully waterproof like some of its portable competitors, but you can connect the device with an extra speaker for stereo sound, and it has up to 16 hours of battery life.

If you want to take the party everywhere you go, this speaker with multicolored light visuals may be the choice for you. It also features multi-device playback for an enhanced listening experience. The Link line-up includes a few different speakers at different sizes, but the Link Pulse 2 is a perfect place to start. Bose SoundLink offers solid sound for its size, and its durability makes it perfect for trips to the park or the beach. Reviewers say that the audio is crisp and clean, even at maximum volume. It doesn’t come with a charge out port, and you can’t pair two of them together for a wider sound range like many of its competitors. But if you’re looking for a personal, budget-friendly, mid sized Bluetooth speaker without all the bells and whistles, reviewers rated this one 4.3 out of 5 stars. Does a 5-star speaker for under $13 sound too good to be true? Amazon reviews seem to think not. This super-portable wireless Bluetooth speaker offers excellent stereo sound and enhanced bass. Forcovr also features a built-in HD microphone for wireless calling. It can connect to your tablet or phone from up to 32 feet away. You can also play your favorite tunes from micro sd cards. Just insert and enjoy. With over 18,000 5-star reviews, the weatherproof Oontz Angle 3 plays loud, distortion-free sound at its maximum volume.

The Oontz provides up to 12 hours of battery life and is easily connected to most smart devices. Image: Bang &amp; Olufsen Don’t let the slim stature of this premium wireless smart speaker fool you.

Also, it has a pretty powerful rear facing speaker on the back to fire-out spacious ambient sound no matter where you’re sitting in the room. You can control your music using the touch panel on the A6 or wirelessly using the BeoMusic app for both Android and iOS. If you have more than one smart speaker, you can enjoy a different song in every room, or you can connect all your spaces for a singular music experience with the A6. It is perfect if you have your music stored in different libraries as it works with a wide range of streaming services and with an average 4.2 stars, it’s worth every penny. Image: PHOTIVE This speaker has jaw dropping sound quality, loud volume, and is shock resistant — perfect for traveling, hiking, and even taking a shower. It’s completely waterproof and flawlessly pairs with iOs and Android devices. With a total sound output of 10 watts, this speaker can fill your room with unbelievably loud sound according to Amazon reviewers. It has a 4.4 star rating so chances are, you’ll be more than satisfied with this choice.

AJ Dellinger,"The Alabama Board of Education has launched an investigation after a high school in Escambia County discovered discrepancies in the grades of a number of students, apparently the result of a hack, according to CBS affiliate WKRG News 5. W.S. Neal High School in East Brewton, Alabama found the inconsistencies in some grades while finalizing a “Top 10"" list of the best-performing students. The school is putting off naming a valedictorian and salutatorian for this year’s graduating class, who are scheduled to receive their diplomas on May 22nd. Escambia County Superintendent John Knott noticed the discrepancies and reported them to the Alabama Board of Education, according to WKRG. He didn’t disclose how many students’ grades were affected, but said, “I’m determined to find all of the facts on how this change happened and I’m determined to resolve this matter.” At the risk of questioning the methods of the superintendent and school board, it seems like they don’t have a great grasp of the situation. While the Board of Education isn’t releasing any details until the investigation is complete, the school has apparently forgone digital forensics in favor of trying to get a student to rat out the supposed hacker. Students have reportedly been called into the principle’s office and pressed if they know who is responsible for changing grades, which is either an attempt to make the kids crack under pressure or part of a desperate search for leads. “My son called on Tuesday afternoon and basically told me that there was an investigation with the Top 10 list, that someone has hacked into the grades and has been changing grades since 2016,” Shannon Odom, a parent of a student at W.S. Neal High School, told WKRG. For the students, the primary concern seems to be how the apparent hack will affect their position on the Top 10 list. Some students may have been bumped out of the top slots by someone who changed their grades and losing that position may affect their hunt for scholarships, which should probably make us reconsider how scholarships are awarded. If the grades were hacked by some enterprising student trying to improve their college prospects or simply avoid discipline, they would not be the first to go about modifying their marks. In 2015, the New York Post reported a 16-year-old in Staten Island hacked his school’s computer system, gained access to his reports cards and transcripts, and modified his grades. He was hit with a criminal complaint for his efforts, though local law enforcement suggested the school should hire him to fix weaknesses in their system. Last year, a University of Iowa student managed to manipulate his own grades, as well as the grades of his friends after he used keyloggers to steal the login credentials of professors. The student stole test questions and exams and changed his grades 90 times over the course of 21 months. It came to an end after an FBI investigation. It seems unlikely the incident in Alabama would require such an in-depth operation for a hacker. Sufficient cybersecurity is expensive and many schools have failed to keep up with what it takes to maintain a secure network. One-third of K-12 schools don’t even encourage their faculty members to use secure passwords, according to a survey conducted by Education Week. All it takes is one guessable password for someone to gain unfettered access to the school’s records and grades. [ WKRG ]","The Alabama Board of Education has launched an investigation after a high school in Escambia County discovered discrepancies in the grades of a number of students, apparently the result of a hack, according to CBS affiliate WKRG News 5.

Ashley Collman,"Proving that age is just a number, an 84-year-old woman is set to graduate this week from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree. In an interview with the Associated Press, Janet Fein said that when she retired from her secretarial job in 2012, she decided to go back to college and get her bachelor's degree because ""I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed."" She decided to major in sociology because she found the topic ""substantial,"" and enjoyed reading and writing papers on the topic. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said. Fein took advantage of a special program in Texas, which allows residents ages 65 and older to take up to six credit hours for free at public universities. According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, 2,000 people took part in the program last year. Read more: A 101-year-old man credits his longevity to his daily Coors Light. Here's what 5 other centenarians had to say about their secret to a long life — and whether they're backed by science. Fein grew up in the Bronx borough of New York City, and says when she was in high school, she couldn't wait to get out and start a job. She graduated early, at the age of 16, and started working as a secretary for a dress manufacturer. She married at the age of 18 and went on to raise five children. Over the decades she worked several other jobs, but her most recent position was a 20-year stint as a secretary at a Dallas orthopedic hospital. She retired at the age of 77. In 1995, Fein got her associate's degree, but getting her bachelor's degree was always a dream of hers. The University of Texas at Dallas. Via Wikimedia Commons She continued to go to classes at UT Dallas even as she transitioned from living alone to living in a senior living facility. When she started having trouble with her knees, she did a semester of independent study and took online classes in order to graduate. ""She did not give up in the midst of her challenges... she just kept plugging along,"" said Fein's college adviser, Sheila Rollerson. Not only did she learn, but she made friends along the way, as well. Fein and Tracy Glass, 40, struck up a friendship when they sat next to each other at the front of the class. Carol Cirulli Lanham, a senior lecturer in sociology, said Fein offered a unique perspective for her class. ""She would speak up a lot in class and I think that it just made for a more interesting class... because she literally remembered some of the times we were talking about,"" Lanham said. She's even inspired one of her caregivers, Renee Brown, to go back to school to become a licensed vocational nurse. ""She said, 'Renee, you can do it. If I can do it you can do it and you will feel so good about it,'"" Brown said.","Janet Fein, 84, is set to graduate from the University of Texas at Dallas with a sociology degree on Wednesday.
