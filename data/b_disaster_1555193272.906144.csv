Nick Douglas,"If I was setting up curriculum at a university, says engineer Foone Turing, Id make an entire semester-long class on the Challenger disaster, and make it required for any remotely STEM-oriented major. Because, says Foone, the disaster was a lot less random or simple than people tend to think. In a thread of 102 tweets, which you can read in essay form here, Foone explains the real reason behind the Challenger disaster, the 2003 Columbia disaster, the sinking of the Titanicand the last time you melted down from anxiety.
The Challenger disaster wasnt a single mistake or flaw or random chance that resulted in the death of seven people and the loss of a two billion dollar spaceship, says Foone. It was a whole series of mistakes and flaws and coincidences over a long time and at each step they figured they could get away with it because they figured the risks were minimal and they had plenty of engineering overhead. And they were right, most of the time. Then one day they werent.
Normalization of deviance
Foone describes the specific cascades of shortcuts and mistakes that led to these famous disasters, and the similar cascades that lead to horrific car crashes on supposedly safe roads. The common factor is that a system is built and stress-tested for one set of circumstances, then stretched a little further in regular use, then finally stretched so far, in a non-optimal situation, that something reaches a breaking point. And all the fudges and allowances fall apart in catastrophic failure. Foone calls this Normalization of Deviance.
A certain road, for example, is built for a 50 MPH speed limit. But because drivers will always push it, the engineer makes sure the road is safe all the way up to 70 MPH under normal conditions. Inevitably, drivers end up taking it at 60 MPH, since everyone knows thats still safe. And then a few people figure it must be safe to drive a little faster than the normal 60 MPH. And a few go even faster. And then it rains, and someone still goes 80 MPH and they crash and die.
Everyone designing a system is constantly fighting against normalization of deviance. And the more things are designed to accommodate misuse, the more the users misuse it. Were in an arms race. And not just designers and engineers, but all of uswere all designing our own lives with a normalization of deviance.
Personal disaster prep
Weve all been there at some point: failing a test because we pulled too many all-nighters, or missing a deadline because we couldnt find those extra hours we thought wed have on the weekend, or having a huge fight because we piled up too many tiny grievances with our partner, or going bankrupt for a medical bill because we spent as much as we earned and tried to live inside a rapacious capitalist system.
When it comes to following standard financial advice, how many of us can say we actually have three

Yes, the systems around us build in certain stressors and failure points, and until those systems are fixed, we have to try not to stack too many other stressors on top of them. Personally, as the father of a three-month-old baby, Im quite freshly aware of this! Before, if the laundry or dishes or grocery shopping didnt get done, enough other stuff was going smoothly that the household could function fine until the weekend. Raising a baby puts a lot more stress on the system, and it becomes crucial to run the dishwasher, or to load the laundry in time to get everything dry and folded before bedtime. A baby is a series of little catastrophes, so theres less room for the others.
Catastrophe-aware empathy
The second personal lesson (another big one for a new parent): everyone around you is also managing a whole system of pressures and impending disasters, sometimes a lot more than you are, so you should be patient and empathetic with them.
In less personal terms, this is why asking someone for just five minutes of their time or just a few bucks is a bigger ask than you think. Its why whenever you want something from someone else, you should think about every possible obstacle and sacrificetravel time, opportunity cost, incidental expensesand take them on yourself. Meet someone near their workplace, pay the tab, secretly pad out deadlines so a delay wont be a catastrophe.
In close relationships, look for each others normalizations of deviance, and help them de-escalate. Take things off each others plate, swap errands or appointments, combine resources, cover for each other during stressful periods. And give yourself that same empathy.
And then, of course, get ready to adapt, because normalization of deviance comes for us all. The best we can do is give it fewer chances to cause a disaster.

Megan Rose Dickey,"The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital. While tech companies have been a bit more deliberate about fostering diversity and inclusion in the last few years — and have made a small bit of progress — the venture capital industry is still sorely lacking in that area. Just one percent of venture capitalists are Latinx and only three percent are black. White people, unsurprisingly, make up 70 percent of the venture capital industry, according to a recent analysis by Richard Kerby, a partner at Equal Ventures. Compared to Kerby’s 2016 analysis, women now make up 18 percent of the VC industry versus just 11 percent. At an intersectional level, black and Latinx women make up zero percent of the venture capital industry. Meanwhile, 40 percent of VCs went to either Stanford or Harvard. “Just TWO schools!,” Kerby wrote on Medium. “Why is that? Everyone wants to work with those they are most similar to, and education, gender, and race are attributes that allow people to find similarities in others.” He added, “With 82% of the industry being male, nearly 60% of the industry being white male, and 40% of the industry coming from just two academic institutions, it is no wonder that this industry feels so insular and less of meritocracy but more of a mirrortocracy.” So, in addition to a lack of racial and gender diversity, there’s also a lack of cognitive diversity. Be sure to head over to Kerby’s Medium post to learn more.","The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital.

Devin Coldewey,"One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises. The latest is that its MyEquifax.com site, to which the company invites those affected by its poor security practices to freeze and unfreeze their credit, itself has extremely poor security.
It’s all documented by security researcher Brian Krebs, who discovered the issue not in some special investigation but in the process of signing up at the site himself. What he found was that “getting an account at MyEquifax.com was easy. In fact, it was too easy.”
In matters of banking and credit, identity is a very important thing to establish. That’s why when you go to MyEquifax.com, it asks you for an email, then for your Social Security number and date of birth.
Slight problem: SSN and DOB were among the personal data leaked in the Equifax breach to begin with! And it doesn’t even check that you own the email address you submit. It does ask a few verification questions, but as Krebs points out these are often public information, such as the street you live on, or your mother’s maiden name, and as such rather worthless for security purposes.
One you have been “verified” with this process, you can immediately request a security freeze on your credit report, or unfreeze it if it’s frozen.
Oh, and don’t worry if you established a PIN for this purpose when setting this up previously, you won’t need that. Yes, this poorly secured website specifically does not require a PIN, though a PIN is required for the same requests via phone or email. When Krebs asked a company representative about this, they explained:
We deployed an experience that embraces both security standards (using a multi-factor and layered approach to verify the consumers identity) and reflects specific consumer feedback on managing security freezes and fraud alerts online without the use of a PIN. The account set-up process, which involves the creation of a username and password, relies on both user inputs and other factors to securely establish, verify, and authenticate that the consumers identity is connected to the consumer every time.
None of that is true. Even elementary security standards like confirming the email address aren’t “embraced,” and multi-factor authentication is trivial to bypass.
This is bad but at least Equifax isn’t alone: It looks like credit reporting agencies Transunion and Experian also have ways of getting around PINs. You’d just think that Equifax, having failed so badly at security before, would want to make its setup a little more robust even meeting basic standards would be good.
As Krebs points out, however, it’s in your interest to set up an account with your actual email address and information, since if you don’t, it seems pretty much anyone with a few data points on you can do so themselves, gaining the ability to freeze and unfreeze your credit.","One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Aarian Marshall,"On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Michael barreled through the Florida panhandle. The most powerful storm to hit the region since record-keeping began in the mid-19th century ran roughshod over the states northwest coasts, damaging two local hospitals enough that they have started evacuating their patients from the areaeven after the storm has left. At least seven people are dead, 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and an estimated 325,000 people who fled the storm have to find their way back home. And in a terrible twist, researchers have found that Hurricane Michael hit some of the states least prepared counties. Those researchersJohn Renne, a professor of urban and regional planning and the director of Florida Atlantic Universitys Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions, and doctoral student Andrea Ramosreviewed six sorts of emergency plans for all 67 of Floridas counties. (In Floridaas in most places in the US emergency preparations happen on the local level.) Renne and Ramos's work found the counties in Florida with the least comprehensive hurricane evacuation plans were mostly in the state's panhandlein the area hit by Hurricane Michael. Each plan that the academics evaluated deals with different sorts of incidents or populations: Special Needs Registries and Specialized Transportation Plans should give authorities information on where and how residents with special needs should travel during an emergency. Pick-up location plans are for those without access to their own vehicles or who cant drive. Pet evacuation plans are for residents with pets (and those unwilling to evacuate without them). Multihazard plans are for events that include both hurricanes and other issues like flooding or environmental contamination risk. Evacuation maps are publicly available, easily accessible plans for evacuation routes. Renne and Ramos graded the effectiveness of each of plan on a 0 to 2 point scale, for a possible 12 points in total. A well-developed scheme scored a two. Non-existent plans got a zero. In the end, ten counties, all in northern Florida or the states panhandle, got weak scoresfewer than four points. Of those, at least one county, Gulf County, is under a mandatory evacuation order this week. Four other counties under mandatory evacuation ordersBay, Dixie, Taylor, and Wakullareceived moderate scores, meaning their plans earned between five and eight points. (The research has not yet been peer reviewed.) On the face of it, these results arent so surprising, says Renne. These are some of the least inhabited areas in Florida, accounting for just 1 percent of the states total permanent population. Plus, most counties receiving weak or moderate scores arent on the coast. If youre not a coastal county, it makes sense that you dont pay as much attention to evacuation plans, Renne says. He also notes that the state of Florida on the whole is much better at disaster planning than other coastal states, many which are less frequently threatened by hurricanes. But that relative distance from the coast will become less of a safeguard as climate change stirs up slower-moving, rain dense weather events. Storms like Michael and Florence are teaching planners to expect even inland coastal flooding. (During last months deluge in the Carolinas, inland areas saw more than 10 feet of flooding after swollen rivers pushed past their banks.) Places are flooding now that may have never flooded before, Renne says. It will take months, maybe years, for authorities to fully understand what happened during this unusually catastrophic storm. Being underprepared is, of course, about risk. Just because a county didnt have complete contingencies for dealing with their most vulnerable populations doesnt mean more of them were affected during Michael. It may be that places with weak plans got lucky this time. But while rescue teams continue to rescue, and lineman work on getting communications up and running in northern Florida, Renne urges more localities to get serious about disaster planning. And for the state and federal authorities to get better about helping them to plan. Theres no measuring stick for evacuation plans, says Renne. Its time to create oneand use it.

Brian Barrett,"There are plenty of guides available on how to protect your data, how to secure yourself online, and how to stop digital snoops from tracking you across the web and then profiting from that intrusion. (Sorry, “monetization”.) You should do these things. But if a cascading series of revelations this past week has taught us anything, it's that all of those steps amount to triage. The things you can control add up to very little next to the things you can’t. It’s an obvious point, especially if you follow the privacy headlines. But a recent example of location-tracking gone wrong—in fairness, it rarely goes right—that unfolded over the last week or so underscores the severity of what you’re up against. On May 10, a New York Times report detailed a service, called Securus, that allegedly allowed a former sheriff to track people’s location, practically in real-time, without a court order. Securus technically requires legal documentation that authorizes use of its services. But senator Ron Wyden (D - Oregon) says Securus told his office that the company “never checks the legitimacy of those uploaded documents,” and that it does not feel obligated to do so. It offers a rubber stamp, then, to letting people know where virtually anyone in the US is standing at any given moment. On the heels of that report, ZDNet detailed how all four major US carriers sell location data to companies you’ve never heard of, without your explicit permission. In this specific case, Securus bought its access from a location aggregator called LocationSmart, which in turn bought it from the telecoms. All of these corporate relationships are arguably legal. ""We don’t really have federal laws that are focused on that backend sale of personal data,"" says Alan Butler, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""A lot this is just the Wild, Wild West, honestly. That’s why the companies do whatever they want."" 'If they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.' Robert Xiao, Carnegie Mellon University That alone would be cause enough for alarm. There’s no opt-out for any of this location sharing. It happens simply by dint of having a cell phone plan. In a very real sense, you’re powerless to prevent your location being used as chattel. Google knows where you are most of the time too, but at least it lets you turn off location tracking, and to delete your history. The company also ostensibly uses the information to help Google Maps, search, and other services that benefit consumers to some degree. The only value AT&amp;T and Verizon create by selling location data to brokers lands on their bottom line. Also, it gets worse. By Wednesday, hackers breached Securus, passing some of the data on its servers—including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords—along to tech site Motherboard. On Thursday, security reporter Brian Krebs revealed that LocationSmart had a security meltdown of its own; while the company says it abides by privacy best practices, including a requirement that someone give consent before being tracked, Carnegie Mellon researcher Robert Xiao discovered that a bug on its web site allowed anyone to locate around 200 million people in the US without their knowledge. “LocationSmart is committed to continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures and is incorporating what it has learned from this incident into that process,” the company said in a statement Friday. LocationSmart says also that the bug has been fixed, and that it had not been exploited prior to Xiao’s discovery. When asked how they were sure that Xiao was the first to exploit the bug, LocationSmart told WIRED that it “reviewed its historical logs.” Xiao urges some skepticism regarding that last claim. “I would be curious to know how they know that,” he says. “The attack flow looks fairly normal. If they looked at their server logs, it would be hard to distinguish what I was doing from normal use.” Regardless, the absence of exploits wouldn’t excuse the sloppiness that created the bug in the first place. Xiao says it took only about 15 minutes of prodding to discover it, and that it stems from an unused feature that the company apparently never bothered to secure. It’s an unconscionable lapse, especially given the sensitive nature of LocationSmart’s business. “I’d almost prefer that they didn’t have access to this in the first place, that this business model didn’t exist,” says Xiao. “But if they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.” It’s a responsibility LocationSmart, and so many others who hold onto your data, abdicated. “Because they value profits above the privacy and safety of the Americans whose locations they traffic in, the wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone,” Senator Wyden said in a statement Friday. “The dangers from LocationSmart and other companies are limitless. If the FCC refuses to act after this revelation then future crimes against Americans will be the commissioners' heads.” (An FCC spokesperson says that ""the matter is being referred to the Enforcement Bureau,"" with no further comment.) Wyden’s office also confirmed that none of the four major carriers have responded to letters he sent last week, asking each of them to audit what third parties have access to location information, if and how their customers consented, and urging safeguards to better manage the fallout of these incidents. 'No individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?' Alan Butler, EPIC You couldn’t hope for a much better encapsulation of the hopeless state of data privacy in the US today. You can see the same casual security sloppiness with which LocationSmart and Securus treated your location in the countless exposed databases —revealing everything from personal information to voter records —or in the extremely, entirely, embarrassingly preventable Equifax breach. The same system that allows AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint to sell your location to companies you’ve never heard of also allows thousands of barely regulated, shadowy data brokers to know everything about not just where you are but who you are, and what you do online. And lack of tangible progress, the sense that this has all happened before and will happen again, the resignation; that’s the cumulative effect of years of breaches and leaks and carelessness that make this all feel so futile. This keeps happening, and keeps not getting fixed. ""No one takes the lead,"" says Butler. ""People acknowledge that it’s a problem, but no individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?"" Laws do restrict what consumer-facing companies can do with your data, but the data broker industry has largely slipped through the cracks. And without a centralized agency taking the lead on privacy in the US, or an omnibus law like Europe's GDPR to act as a wider safety net, that's not going to change. None of which means you should give up. You should still follow those guides, and adjust those settings. But you should also know that better privacy can only come if and when companies respect you enough to grant it. And if they continue not to, your only option is to yell loudly enough—at the FCC, at lawmakers, at anyone who will listen—that they no longer have a choice.

GAIL COLLINS,"His opponent, Nate McMurray, hoped that Collins would eventually get desperate. And if hes down, hes going to throw that Hail Mary, and if he does that, were going to intercept that ball, and were going to run it back, said the Democrat. The district is near Buffalo, where sports metaphors are very popular. Collins, who seems to rely heavily on mentioning the name of Nancy Pelosi whenever possible, is still a slight favorite to win in a district that Donald Trump won by 25 points. The voters still have more than a week to decide whether they really want a congressman who uses the Values section of his web page to define Personal Accountability as never increasing entitlement programs. Heres one bright spot: This isnt the worst year on record for indicted congressmen running to stay in office. Back in 1978, we had four. And there would have been five except that authorities in New York agreed to drop charges of soliciting sex from a minor against Representative Fred Richmond after Richmond, a Democrat, agreed to go to a counseling program. Still, two running in a general election is very unusual, said Prof. Allan Lichtman of American University. Lichtman, the author of The Embattled Vote in America, said the 1978 corruption stars included Michigan Democrat Charles Diggs, who was convicted and awaiting sentence when he won re-election. Pennsylvania boasted two indicted Democrats. One (bribery, perjury and influence-peddling) got re-elected. The other (conflict of interest) lost. Floridians voted out J.

Kirsten Korosec,"Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook. The ride-hailing company is centralizing how it responds to disasters, whether it’s flooding in North Carolina, a mass shooting in Las Vegas or an earthquake in Mexico City. Now, instead of taking a local-first (and sometimes reactionary) approach, the company’s global security center will monitor and coordinate responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company, which announced the change in a blog post this week, has become part of the urban landscape. People use the Uber app to commute to work, attend concerts and other events, rent bikes (and eventually scooters) and even have food delivered. People have become increasingly reliant on the service, a responsibility that requires more than an app that connects drivers and riders. The GSC, as Uber calls it, monitors and flags issues that may affect its business and the communities in which it operates. From here, the GSC staff, which includes former military and security experts who speak a dozen different languages, coordinate with local Uber staff and city, county or state officials. The GSC is the entity that will make decisions on when to suspend service in an area or whether to cap surge pricing. The GSC might also lend support to local authorities, depending on their needs. This procedural change is another illustration of CEO Dara Khosrowshahis efforts to rehabilitate the company and its reputation. It also telegraphs the company’s push to work more closely with cities. In April, Khosrowshahi announced a series of new products to its app, including a deal with instant car-booking service Getaround to launch a product called UberRENT and a partnership with Masabi that lets users pay and book tickets for public transit in the Uber app. Uber also launched Movement in 2017, a tool that provides cities with traffic data.","Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook.

Adi Robertson,"Nobody expected great things out of today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing about social media platforms censoring conservatives. The hearing came on the heels of Congress’ multi-day session with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, where lawmakers exhaustively asked about the issue. Claims about large-scale censorship are basically unfalsifiable, and none of the tech companies invited even showed up. The whole thing looked potentially like a soapbox for vloggers Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, who were invited to the hearing alongside a few policy experts. But the social media hearing was not just bland or tedious. It was depressingly, almost deliriously bad: full of bad arguments, bizarre tangents, and a lot of shouting. The hearing’s opening statements, by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), set the tone for the next few hours. Goodlatte spoke portentously about the power and responsibility of social media platforms, invoking quotes from both Ronald Reagan and Mark Zuckerberg. Nadler, the committee’s ranking Democrat, was annoyed. “The central thesis of this hearing doesn’t hold up under even the most basic scrutiny,” he protested. “This committee can do better.” Diamond and Silk suggest Mark Zuckerberg tried to fix the election with Facebook’s ad algorithm Republican lawmakers like Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) spoke vaguely in favor of bills to make companies “liable” for their actions, while admitting that private companies could police platforms however they wanted. A few brought up Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the safe harbor rule Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) badly misinterpreted during Zuckerberg’s hearings. Most Democrats were either wearily contemptuous of the proceedings, or asked panelists unrelated questions about Cambridge Analytica and bot regulation. “This is a stupid and ridiculous hearing. The only reason I’m still here is I want to enter some facts into the record,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), plausibly speaking for a large chunk of the committee. For Republicans, the day was mostly an excuse to lecture Silicon Valley and heap praise on Hardaway and Richardson, albeit not always accurately — Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) addressed a question at one point to “Diamond and Spice.” It’s really not clear what transpired between the vloggers and Facebook’s policy team, and a ThinkProgress analysis found that their traffic dips were probably tied to broad algorithm changes. But the company’s letter dubbing them “unsafe to the community,” even if it was completely retracted, sounds plausibly sinister. Diamond and Silk escalated this complaint into a sweeping conspiracy where Mark Zuckerberg interfered in the 2018 elections (we’re not sure which ones) by manipulating conservative users’ advertising preferences so they’d be targeted with liberal ads. They proceeded to get into shouting matches with various committee members, as representatives pressed the pair about receiving money from the Trump campaign — something they claimed under oath had never happened, before admitting that they’d been reimbursed for plane tickets. “We can see that you do look at fake news,” Richardson sneered at Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), when he read out a line from an official Trump campaign finance filing, stating that Diamond and Silk had been paid for consulting. “Are you calling this FEC document fake?” Jeffries asked. Several outlets have chronicled the false or dubious statements Diamond and Silk made under oath during the hearing. They’re characterized as lying in some stories, and at the very least, they seemed indifferent to being particularly accurate. At one point Hardaway complained about people saying Facebook was a private company and not a public utility, because “they went public in 2012” — referring to the company going public on the stock market. Every member has left the Diamond & Silk hearing except Darrell Issa pic.twitter.com/OjJmtzPld2 — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) April 26, 2018 After nearly two and a half hours, the Judiciary Committee’s YouTube stream froze, cutting off the end of the hearing. Business Insider reporter Joe Perticone posted a picture of panelists sitting in front of a nearly empty row of desks, saying that only one committee member was still listening. The truncated video is now online, along with copies of panelists’ testimony, and we know the same things we did this morning: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have inappropriately banned or restricted some conservative material, but there’s little evidence that they’re singling out conservatives rather than making mistakes across the board. Beyond the able testimony of TechFreedom president Berin Szóka, NYU Law professor Ari Waldman, and News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern, the finest thing to come out of this hearing was a beautiful vision for social media’s future, delivered by Rep. Lieu: Ted Lieu: “Let’s say they want to write an algorithm that promotes cats. Can the government stop them from doing that?” Berin Szóka: “Thankfully not.” Lieu: “And let’s say Facebook figures out, you know, promoting cats gets a lot more people to sign onto Facebook than promoting Diamond and Silk. Can the government intervene and stop Facebook from doing that?” Szóka: ”No.” Lieu: “And let’s say Twitter figures out, you know, we’re going to promote nice, cuddly images of furry animals rather than dismembered body parts. Can the government say you can’t do that?” Szóka: “No.” Mr. Lieu, please sponsor a funding bill for this new cat-only internet. The world will remember you as a hero.","The hearing, featuring vloggers Diamond and Silk, was not just bland or tedious.

The deaths follow a growing number of recent American military accidents, including two deadly collisions involving American warships in 2017, and will likely sharpen the spotlight on the countrys military operations in Asia.

A.A. Newton,"Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication. In the aftermath of a destructive storm, your phone or tablet can be a literal lifeline—so it needs to actually work. Losing the ability to communicate with the outside world makes it harder to coordinate relief efforts and downright impossible to let friends and family know you’re safe. Personal safety should always take top priority, but if your family disaster plan relies on smartphones or laptops in any way, it’s crucial that you take steps to prevent them from being damaged. Here are some ways to do just that. Waterproof Your Devices Obviously, keeping your electronics dry is crucial in a hurricane, and the easiest way to do this is to pack all of your tech in airtight, watertight plastic containers. If you have a vacuum sealer, perfect; seal your backup batteries, chargers, adapters, and cords in bags before packing them. If you don’t, Ziploc bags work well. In either case, silica gel packets provide extra dryness insurance, so long as they’re not already saturated with moisture. You can recharge saturated silica in a pinch by drying it out in a 200-250ºF oven for a few hours, but if you’re unsure how dry it is, buying fresh stuff from the hardware store is your best bet. Diversify Your Charger Portfolio A phone or laptop with a dead battery is completely useless, so be sure to pack lots of different battery-replenishing options in your go bag. Fully-charged external batteries are a must, and USB-compatible car chargers let you charge devices from any car with a working battery—just be sure to unplug the adapter when you’re done. Throw in a power strip or two to make the most of any functional power outlets you encounter, plus some extra connecting cables, and you should be fully covered. Get the Most Out of Your Smartphone The pocket-sized supercomputers we all carry around are lifesavers in an emergency situation, even when cell service or wifi is unavailable. Your smartphone can handle everything from first-aid apps to downloaded maps to quick-access document storage; figure out what information you need access to and download it to your phone. While you’re at it, take necessary precautions to maximize your phone’s battery life, which could make your life much easier in an extended power outage. Generally speaking you don't want to rely on technology at all in your disaster toolkit, but… Read more Read If you haven’t already, be sure to activate your phone’s emergency contact functions. Android users can add emergency contacts to their lock screen, and the Medical ID function of Apple’s Health app allows you to make relevant medical and contact information lock screen-accessible. Opt in to emergency notifications, too: Android settings are under the “Cell Broadcast” header, and iOs settings are in the “Government Alerts” section of the Notifications menu. Back Up Absolutely Everything If you rely on a physical hard drive for important file backups—or worse, don’t back anything up at all—get a cloud backup running ASAP. I use Backblaze, which is perfectly fine, but there are a ton of options out there. If you’re not sure where to start, Lifehacker has a few guides to online backup services that will help. Don’t forget to take photos and/or video of your house, yard, and any other property you have insured in case you need to file claims—and back those up, too. Use Social Media to Your Advantage A physical meeting place is crucial to an IRL emergency plan, but you should have a social media “meeting” plan too—especially if you have out-of-towners worrying about you. Consumer Reports recommends choosing one platform for check-ins and ensuring that every family member has the relevant app installed on their phone. As for far-flung family and friends, designate one person who lives out of the disaster zone as your liaison. Ask this person to be available for check-ins and do the work of updating other concerned parties so you can focus on more important things.","Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Over the course of this conflict, President Trump has emboldened Saudi and emirati leaders. He shares their antipathy for Iran and will sell them virtually any weapon they want. Now, the Trump administration, which also supplies the coalition with intelligence, refueling capabilities and other assistance, is sending mixed signals. While the Pentagon urged the coalition not to attack, a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday made no such explicit request. Instead, he made clear to the emirate leaders “our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and lifesaving commercial imports.” He mildly called for all sides to work with the United Nations on a political solution. The war began in 2014, when Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the capital, Sana, and much of the rest of the country. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition, with President Barack Obama’s backing, launched airstrikes against the Houthi forces. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both Sunni Arab nations, see the Al Hudaydah offensive as a way to break a stalemate in the war and deal a crippling blow to the indigenous Houthis and their backers in Shiite-led Iran, which the Sunnis consider their chief rival for regional influence. They have accused the Houthi rebels of using the port to smuggle in arms, including missiles, allegedly supplied by Iran to attack Saudi Arabia. A United Nations panel has expressed doubt that Al Hudaydah is a weapons transit point, and other experts question whether Iran provided the missiles.",Sudanese forces fighting alongside the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen pressed toward Al Hudaydah on Tuesday.,2018-06-13T02:06:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On the Brink of Disaster in Yemen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/yemen-saudi-attack-port-houthis.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/opinion/13yemenWeb/13yemenWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
ROGER COHEN,"The vote will certainly be closer as maximalist pro-Brexit zealots within her Conservative Party, who want no accommodation with the European Union, realize their insanity could end up delivering the sanity of Britain remaining. Its still more likely, however, that a deal twice defeated will be defeated a third time unless May tries this desperate gambit: Vote for the deal and I will resign March 30. She wont do that.
If her deal finally dies an irrevocable death, May will have to negotiate an extension with the European Union. The union will want to know what the extension beyond March 29 is for. It will probably favor a long extension because a short one is likely to be useless, given that nearly three years of negotiation have produced only mayhem.
Personally, I think an indefinite extension might be the solution lurking in the long grass. That way Britain could remain in the European Union forever while professing to want to leave. Brexit could be Britains Godot. Everyone would be happy.
That wont happen in this dour age. But I suspect a long extension will be granted with the reason for it getting fudged. If its not, no-deal Brexit looms again as imminent (in fact, it looms anyway as one possible outcome at the end of any long extension).
Once this whole mess goes beyond March 29 (many Brits would now prefer summary execution to more talk of Brexit), all bets are off. Britain could find itself voting in theEuropean Parliament election in May, a surreal exercise. In June, three years will have passed since the Brexit vote. Polls suggest opinion has shifted in favor of remaining. I cant imagine a long extension without either a general election or a second referendum: This will have to go back to the people.
I told you we are in Act IV, if that. Oh, yes, the Malthouse Compromise: You dont need to worry, dear reader. It was a fantasy. Whats real is that Britain is better off with more than a half-billion other people in the borderless European miracle that is the union.",This British national disaster has legs.

Aimée Lutkin,"If you have pets, you know they can create a mess. Some of that mess can be vacuumed up by your Roomba, and some of it will create an absolute disaster if it gets eaten by the robot vacuum. You know what I’m talking about. (I’m talking about poop.)

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Hello friends. Friendly reminder that while our financial lives may seem like a disaster and we’re all stressed out about not having enough money, one of the few financial vehicles that actually benefits people who use it is the 401(k). In this story about a study reporting that 66 percent of millennials have $0 saved in their 401(k)s, Vice writes that, “It is worth noting, however, that 401(k)s are generally bullshit.” (Emphasis theirs.) Where to begin. Yes, I understand that 401(k)s aren’t magic. You need money to save money, not everyone has access to them (particularly as freelancers and gig economy workers comprise ever more of the workforce), and it can be overwhelming or seemingly impossible to think about saving for retirement when you have a mountain of student loan debt and your rent eats up half of your paycheck. Employers are much less generous than they used to be, and our retirement crisis exemplifies that all people, of all age groups, have trouble saving money. Defined benefit plans (a.k.a. pensions) were nice when they existed and were properly managed. Ideally, people would be getting more money. I’m not disputing any of this. But there is a general cynicism that permeates certain areas of the web/culture that basically seems to say, well, we’re all screwed, so why even try? I don’t think this is the intent, but I can’t help but see it as a consequence, and it’s irresponsible. If a bunch of publications that you trust tell you that 401(k)s are bullshit, and you don’t know any better, are you going to prioritize contributing to your retirement account? You can be mad about the system while still encouraging people to do what’s in their best interest, which is to put some money away for retirement. Here are some of the study’s other takeaways: Most employed people aged 21 to 32 who are saving for retirement have less than $20,000 saved The average balance is $67,891 83 percent of working Latinos and 70 percent of African Americans have nothing saved Only 55 percent of Millennials are eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, compared to 77 percent of GenXers and 80 percent of Baby Boomers This puts them on par with other generations, per other studies: two-thirds of Americans across generations aren’t putting money into their 401(k) I am not trying to proselytize about 401(k)s and claim that they’re the ideal and ultimate financial product, or that you need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do better. As the study indicates, those working may not even have the option to use one, as our employers get ever more stingy. And I can’t make you save—particularly if you do not have the money to save—but I will say this: the system may be bullshit, but 401(k)s aren’t. Publications that are making a point to spotlight growing inequities and the dangers of permalancing and gig economy work—which they absolutely should—also need to take the time to educate people on what they can do to better their finances, particularly if employers and the government won’t. You can throw your hands up in the air and say everything sucks, but at the end of the day, you need money. It’s not something to be cavalier about. So if you are lucky enough to have access to a 401(k) at work and the ability to contribute, then contribute. Even just a tiny bit. Americans are shouldering around $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, and around 70% of college… Read more Read I’m not talking about aiming for the maximum (for 2018, that’s $18,500). But even if you contribute one or two percent of your paycheck, that’s exponentially better than contributing nothing at all. This is true for many reasons: If your employer offers a 401(k), they likely offer an employer match. And you should think of that money as part of your compensation. Would you be ok with your employer paying you $49k instead of $50k when you agreed to the latter? No? It’s the same thing with your 401(k) match. Suddenly your two percent contribution becomes four percent. They should be giving you the money anyway, but they’ve put this requirement on it, so you should do it regardless. If you don’t put in enough to get the match, you’re essentially forfeiting a portion of your salary. It lowers your taxable income, meaning you’re paying less in taxes and therefore taking home more money. Typically fees are lower than if you invested on your own, and you can gain exposure to expensive stocks you wouldn’t be able to otherwise (like the Amazons and Facebooks of the world). Compound! Interest! Please contribute something to yours, especially when you’re young. “If you go back and look at it historically, people who invested in a 401(k) have money in retirement,” says Kevin Dixon, senior market analyst at Market Traders Institute. “They’re incredibly intelligent vehicles. It’s a no-brainer, really.” So: Be mad. Understand that maxing out your retirement account alone likely still won’t be enough to live off of in retirement, and that many of us will be working long after we would like. Fight to keep the safety net in place, and push our government to expand it rather than quietly eroding it piece by piece. Understand your entire financial picture, beyond investing for retirement, and what needs to be done to put you in the best position possible. As the study suggests, lobby lawmakers to loosen ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs benefits) participation restrictions and back your workplace’s union. Demand that politicians institute the fiduciary rule. But don’t be fooled into thinking it’s better to tweet about how screwed we all are than to put a little money away in your 401(k). It might seem painful and fruitless now, but you’ll be better off. Use cynicism to demand more and better, but don’t let it harm your future finances in the meantime.","Hello friends.

Now, a developer known for restoring old properties, the 1933 Group, has bought the 1925 building with the intention of bringing it back to its gloriously kitschy past. Considering how much Los Angeles has been criticized for ignoring its history, this endeavor has drawn some cheers. “This is something of a victory for history, and the often fleeting life of local landmarks,” David L. Ulin, a former book critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote in an essay celebrating the project. “For my money — or the developer’s — it’s also a welcome sign of Los Angeles growing up.” Continue reading the main story","Tuesday: California-as-Disaster, recreational marijuana, tax problems and the Formosa Cafe lives.",2017-12-26T14:00:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Dark Depictions of a Sunny State,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/us/california-today-dark-depictions-of-a-sunny-state.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/26/us/26californiatoday/26californiatoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
"A.A. Newton on Vitals, shared by A.A. Newton to Lifehacker","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does. As it turns out, a face full of painful lesions—not to mention unsolicited, tone-deaf advice from family and strangers alike—has a way of driving people into hiding. Throw in a whole internet’s worth of unverified anecdotes about banishing acne for good and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Zits are unfair. We didn’t ask for them, we certainly don’t deserve to have them into adulthood,… Read more Read Treating acne is maddening. Even if your breakouts are under control, you may be left with dark spots, red spots, dents, and/or bumps—the ghosts of hell-zits past. Today’s super-saturated skincare market offers thousands of products that claim to fade acne scars, but frankly, very few of them work. Before you drench your face in retinol and acids to fade your acne scars, you should figure out what caused them in the first place—and if they’re even scars at all. What The Heck Are Acne Scars, Anyway? Scar tissue forms when an injury or illness damages your skin’s ability to produce collagen, the protein that gives skin its structure. As Dr. Meghan Feely, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey, explained to me in an email, the same process causes acne scars. Inflammation—redness, pain, and/or swelling—from deep-rooted zits can injure surrounding skin cells, altering the collagen they produce to repair injured skin. Depending on the amount of collagen the damaged cells produce, she explained, patients are left with either atrophic or hypertrophic scars. Atrophic scars happen when acne-damaged skin cells don’t produce enough collagen to refill the injured area, leaving indentations in the skin. Any dimpled, dented texture you notice after a breakout heals is caused by atrophic scarring. Typically, these scars present in one of three patterns: ice-pick (deep and narrow, like pinholes), boxcar (wide and squared-off), and rolling (wide and rounded). The shape and size of atrophic scars depends on the extent of the tissue damage, as well as how your skin typically heals from injury. When acne-damaged skin cells overproduce collagen, they leave hypertrophic scars, which are raised and often shiny. Hypertrophic scars occur more frequently in severe wounds that don’t close early on in the healing process: a surgical incision is less likely to leave a raised scar than, say, a massive cyst that repeatedly gets its head scratched off. However, whether or not you get hypertrophic scars mostly comes down to genetics. If your family members tend to develop raised, bumpy scars, you probably will, too. Generally, only very severe acne leaves scars. Age and family history influence their development to some extent, but according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Diane Madfes, the biggest scarring predictors are the acne’s depth and duration. The deeper the zits, and the longer they go untreated, the more likely they are to cause permanent damage—which acne scars are, unfortunately. If you’re not sure what you’re dealing with, gently run your fingers over the spots in question. If they’re indented or raised, you have acne scars; if they’re smooth, but discolored, you have something else. If My Dark Spots Aren’t Acne Scars, What Are They? Not all breakouts leave scars. Mild lesions may not go deep enough to damage collagen-producing cells, and some deep-rooted zits don’t stick around long enough to cause permanent structural damage. However, inflammation from a breakout can piss off cells closer to the surface of your skin, causing them to function abnormally for awhile. This process is what causes some zits to leave dark or red spots when they heal. The color of a post-acne mark depends on which cells were damaged. Dark spots are caused by damaged melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. These spots are usually brown, but can be purplish or bluish depending on your skin tone. This type of discoloration is called hyperpigmentation. Some breakouts leave red spots when they heal, which is a sign of damaged or irritated surface-level capillaries. Your body’s first response to illness or injury is usually to increase blood flow to the affected area, causing temporary redness and swelling known as erythema. Erythema usually dissipates once a wound has healed, but sometimes capillaries around the healing site are too damaged to immediately return to their normal, pre-injury state. Both of these conditions are caused by inflammation and persist after it clears, so their full names are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema—PIH or PIE for short. The superficial cell damage behind PIH and PIE is temporary, though the marks can take months or years to fade. If your post-acne marks aren’t clearly brown or red, you can figure out if they’re PIE or PIH by pushing on them gently with a fingertip. PIE temporarily disappears when pressed because doing so cuts off blood flow to the affected capillaries. Unlike blood, melanin is static, so PIH marks will look the same regardless of how much you poke at them. What Can I Do To Prevent Scarring And Pigmentation? The likelihood of developing scars, PIH, and/or PIE is mostly down to genetics, but as Dr. Madfes explains, inflicting additional trauma on already inflamed skin makes things worse: “Some people tend to pick at the acne scar, or the acne bump, because they feel a raised surface. [...] Light trauma should not cause marks, but if someone’s going to pick, try and get out the pus, or manipulate the area, [they’re] going to increase the incidence of scarring and hyperpigmentation.” Anything you can do to encourage proper healing, on the other hand, is good. Besides resisting the urge to squeeze, Dr. Madfes recommends keeping open lesions “moist and covered” until they heal—she specifically says Vaseline is a great wound protectant—and using a moisturizer with ceramides. However, she emphasizes that the best way to prevent picking—and, by extension, PIH/PIE or scars—is to resolve the acne that causes it in the first place. How Do I Get Rid of Them? Mild PIH and PIE—with no accompanying active acne—will resolve with on their own within a year. If that’s too long to wait, sunscreen is the surest way to speed up the fading process. When your skin darkens from sun exposure, your PIH does too; wearing a broad-spectrum, high-SPF formula every day protects your skin from further damage and helps it heal properly. Sunscreen is a wonder of technology. It’s the closest thing we have to an anti-aging miracle, and… Read more Read However, most people who seek treatment for PIH/PIE and scarring also have active acne—and every specialist I spoke to for this story agrees that resolving chronic acne is the first step to treating post-inflammatory marks. Mild acne can be effectively treated with over-the-counter products; Dr. Madfes recommends starting with a product containing micronized benzoyl peroxide like the Acne.org treatment or this cleanser from Differin. Non-micronized particles are too big to penetrate pores, and their irregular size and shape makes them prone to clumping together—which renders the medication less effective and more irritating. The retinoid adapalene —now available over the counter as Differin —effectively treats acne and PIH, as do ingredients like niacinamide and azelaic acid, although to a lesser extent. (I use and love Melazepam, which is a 20% azelaic acid cream.) Whichever treatment you choose, be patient: topical medications take at least three months to show results. Where’s a dermatologist when you need one? A recent investigation by Women’s Health details a… Read more Read Moderate to severe acne benefits from professional intervention, and the earlier, the better. If your insurance covers it, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. If you’re uninsured or have shitty insurance, find a skilled esthetician—a licensed professional who specializes in skincare techniques. Esthetician licensing requirements vary by state, and their individual areas of expertise range from waxing to laser resurfacing, so really do your research: check out their website, do a critical scan of Yelp reviews, and/or get recommendations from friends and family. (This also applies to dermatologists, by the way.) When you request an appointment, specifically ask to see an acne specialist. If there’s a long wait, put your name on the cancellation list and check in every few weeks. At your appointment, give the dermatologist or esthetician a detailed history of your acne—including medications you’ve tried in the past, any you take now, and your tendency to develop PIH, PIE, or scars—so they can decide how best to treat you. Both dermatologists and estheticians aim to resolve acne before treating pigmentation or scarring, but many medications and procedures do both at once. Topical retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene) are proven multitaskers, and dermatologists frequently prescribe them to treat acne and hyperpigmentation. (Insurance companies notoriously skimp on topical prescription coverage, so if your tube of tretinoin costs two hundred dollars— not an exaggeration —look for manufacturer coupons and discount pharmacies to lower the price.) For patients with active acne and pigmentation to address, estheticians favor chemical peels. Licensed esthetician and acne specialist Mary Freihofner told me that she uses glycolic, mandelic, and salicylic acid peels for her acne clients with hyperpigmentation—but once the lesions have healed, she thinks microdermabrasion works faster. Erythema may not respond to hyperpigmentation treatments, and in those cases, Freihofner finds Vitamin C peels to be quite effective. A professional facial with a peel usually costs between eighty and two hundred dollars, depending on your location and the specific treatments you choose. If Acne Scars Are Permanent, What Can I Do About the Ones I Have? There are effective ways to treat acne scars, but they don’t come cheap. Since scarring is caused by damaged tissue in the dermis—the middle layer of skin—treating it requires some level of penetration. Many dermatologists, including Dr. Feely and Dr. Madfes, treat acne scarring by way of dermal resurfacing techniques, most of which involve lasers. Certain types of lasers can penetrate the epidermis—the outermost layer of skin—to stimulate collagen-producing cells in the dermis, reducing the appearance of scars over time. Lasers are less invasive than traditional surgical techniques, but all dermal penetration has risks: you don’t want to damage any nerves or blood vessels while you’re poking around down there. This is why laser resurfacing is performed only by specially trained, licensed professionals—and why it’s often expensive. One laser resurfacing session can cost anywhere from a hundred bucks to well over a thousand, depending on how much time under the laser you need. These procedures are elective and not technically medically necessary, so insurance won’t cover them; always get a quote before scheduling a session. You don’t necessarily have to see a dermatologist for laser therapy, though; many skincare clinics offer the same services. Raelle Levicke, a licensed esthetician and laser technician at About Face Skincare in Philadelphia, swears by fractionated lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. She explained that surface-level treatments—chemical peels, microneedling, and microdermabrasion—are somewhat effective at fading hyperpigmentation, but they literally don’t go deep enough to treat scar tissue. Fractionated lasers are her weapon of choice for acne scars and severe hyperpigmentation, but she prefers IPL treatments for treating erythema. Depending on the case, her patients see results after two to four sessions. I know from experience how horrible it is to feel like you’re doomed to cycle between painful breakouts and scars forever, so if there’s one point I want to really hammer home, it’s this: find a licensed professional who specializes in acne treatment. A dermatologist who’s normally up to their eyeballs in melanomas—or an esthetician who mostly gives relaxing facials—will probably treat you differently than someone with years of experience treating acne. There’s someone out there who can help you—don’t give up until you find them.","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does.

If you need to evenly heat a delicate substance to a precise temperature, the microwave might seem like a horrible choice—but it’s often the best tool for the job. Your cooking and baking, especially, depend a lot on your oven's ability to regulate heat and… Read more Read Traditional heating methods—double boilers, ovens, skillets, and the like—heat food via thermal conduction, so the outer layers necessarily heat before the center does, even with constant whisking or stirring. Uneven heat is the enemy of temperature-reliant processes like tempering chocolate or caramelizing sugar, so an old electric range or uncalibrated oven can really work against you. Double boilers and bains-marie can effectively moderate finicky heat sources, but they could add excess moisture to whatever you’re cooking. In some cases, a little water is no big deal—but in others, it’s the kiss of death. If you’re trying to heat a homogenous liquid to a specific temperature as quickly and evenly as possible, the humble microwave oven won’t let you down. Microwaves work by making water, fat, and sugar molecules spin around like crazy—which releases heat—so they cook the interior of liquids at roughly the same rate as the exterior. (This isn’t true for solid foods, especially frozen items like Hot Pockets, whose molecules are tied up in rigid structures that prevent them from rotating at a consistent rate.) Even better, they’re usually so powerful that whatever temperature increase you’re after happens in mere minutes. Zapping a custard in the microwave feels like cheating—but the results will convert you. I’ve recently started cooking lemon curd in the microwave, and I’m never going back. As custards go, lemon curd is pretty chill; it doesn’t need to be tempered, and all that acid facilitates a smooth emulsion. That forgiving nature makes lemon curd a perfect poster child for this method. If the microwave significantly improves an already-simple process (and it sure does), just think of what it can do for more annoying ones; consider this a gateway drug to the wonderful, low-pressure world of microwaved custard. Microwave Lemon Curd The proportions called for below work perfectly for my tastes—super-tart, with a good hit of salt to balance the sugar, and soft enough to eat like pudding straight from the jar—but if you’re in a committed relationship with a specific lemon curd recipe, use that one. Just don’t skip the microwave, which is kind of the whole point here. A fast-read electronic thermometer will ensure you nail the temperature, but skip it if you’re confident in your ability to eyeball a perfectly-cooked custard. A note on lemon size: the lemons at ALDI have been absolute units as of late, so two of them yielded a generous half-cup of juice and a mountain of zest. If your lemons are smaller, you might need three, or even four. This will make just about a cup and a half of curd, which perfectly fills a repurposed jam jar; it scales well though, so make as much as your heart desires. Ingredients: ½ cup (200 g) granulated sugar ¼ teaspoon table salt Zest and juice of two large or three medium lemons; you need about ½ cup (120 milliliters / 120 grams) of juice 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk ½ stick (4 ounces, 114 grams, 4 tablespoons) salted butter Instructions: Measure the sugar and salt into a large, microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup. Zest the lemons directly into the sugar and salt, then rub together with your fingertips until everything smells nice and lemony. Pour in the egg, egg yolk, and lemon juice; blitz with a stick blender to combine. (If you don’t have a stick blender, whisk aggressively.) Taste and add a bit more sugar if needed. Transfer the egg-lemon-sugar mixture to the microwave and heat on full power in one-minute increments, stirring between each zap, until it reaches 185ºF (85ºC). Depending on your microwave, this will take anywhere from three to ten minutes—this specific batch took about five. It’s pretty hard to overcook the curd a minute at a time, but if you’re worried about it, just work in 30-second increments. Stir the butter into the hot lemon-egg mixture until fully incorporated, then give the curd one final blitz with the stick blender or whisk. If you see lumps of cooked egg, or just prefer a completely smooth finished product, pour the curd through a fine mesh strainer before transferring to a storage container. Taste once more, adding more sugar, salt, or lemon juice as needed. Cover and cool to room temperature before refrigerating. It’ll keep for a couple weeks in the fridge, but if you’re worried about longevity, lemon curd freezes beautifully. Having lemon curd around in the summertime makes it easy to whip up flavorful, refreshing desserts without spending hours sweating over a hot stove. I especially love it as the main flavoring agent in a lemon cheesecake or tart filling, but it’s also great dolloped on panna cotta or vanilla ice cream. Really, though, you can put it on anything—or just eat it from the jar with a spoon.","No matter how many flawless custards or mirror glazes you’ve made in your life, some culinary techniques just seem to invite disaster, especially those that hinge on precise temperature control.

Here are some tips for how to prepare for the worst so you can relax and enjoy the best of what your trip has to offer, while minimizing your risk for the worst. When you leave the U.S. as an American citizen traveling abroad, you have a few safety nets, and Reddit user u/baccgirl pointed ou t on LifeProTips that you should know what they are before the flight takes off. A huge one is your country’s embassy; before you arrive, make sure you know where that embassy is located in your destination, and what their hours of operation are. Commenter u/ doublestitch added that you might be better off getting that information for your country’s consulate, as embassies general attend to diplomatic matters. But hey, why not both?

U/Baccgirl writes: Have a secure email that you can access while overseas, with scans of important papers. Birth certificate, passport scan, emergency contacts.

After all, if you’ve lost everything, that might include email access. U/ madi154 wrote of their own harrowing experience saved by a paper and pen: Also write down important phone numbers of your family members and the number of the hotel or people you’re staying with and the address. Have multiple papers with this and put this everywhere! Put it in every luggage, wallet and bag you will travel with. You never know when you will need it. For example, my luggage was lost and thankfully I had a paper with the phone number and address of the people I was staying with so that the luggage could get delivered there. Check your passport expiration date You need a valid passport to leave the US, but u/baccgirl writes that many countries “require you to have a minimum of 6 months of validity remaining on your passport AFTER your departure date from that country.” Even if your vacation is only a few weeks long, you need that passport to be valid for much, much longer. Just check the numbers in advance so you don’t get sent home from the airport extremely disappointed. Register your trip in case of emergency There was also a recommendation from u/swild89, who commented, “I’ll add to that—register your travel itinerary with the government. You can plan everything you want, but if an emergency strikes, you are prepared.” In the US, this is called the STEP program, and it make the embassy in the country you’re visiting aware you’re there in case of emergency. If there is danger in the area you’ll be notified, and in the event of a natural disaster, you’ll be accounted for. Be ready to roll with the punches Some commenters complained that all these tips were actually just advising people to go overboard and ruin their vacation with worry. As u/ RunninADorito wrote: Being fully and completely prepared is both impossible and stupid. The idea that traveling to a different country requires a crazy amount of preparation is the wrong mindset. If you’re going to France you might want to do X. If you’re going to Cambodia do Y.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

GAIL COLLINS,"Wow, Trump’s new lawyer talks just like him. So it comes down to this: The $130,000 that Stormy Daniels got to keep quiet during the campaign was from Trump. But it was not an illicit campaign contribution. Nonono, it was simply a charitable attempt to protect Melania from a broken heart. To come to this conclusion you would only have to do two things: A) Forget that on Thursday Giuliani said it had to be paid because “Imagine if that came out … in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.” B) Conclude that in buying off Stormy, Donald Trump was much, much more concerned about his wife’s feelings than about getting elected president. Trump and Giuliani go way back. They’re New Yorkers with lots in common, including three wives each, and a history of messy public breakups. (Trump carried on the adulterous affair that ended his first marriage, a story he promoted to the New York tabloids. Giuliani once announced his separation to the press corps before he told his wife.) The president reportedly bragged that he was hiring “America’s mayor” as his first line of defense. It was, of course, a reference to Giuliani’s role leading New York City after 9/11. During a recovery made even more difficult by the fact that Rudy had insisted on putting the city’s emergency command center in the World Trade Center, which had already been bombed by terrorists once and which the police warned was a terrible location. Both men hyped their post-9/11 activities, each in his own special way. Trump seems to have imagined he visited the ruins immediately after the attack. Rudy did go there repeatedly, taking visitors to watch the workers who were laboring to clear the site in the toxic dust without protective gear. Back then, what would you have said if someone told you that Mayor Giuliani would eventually devote his legal skills to defending President Donald Trump from a porn star scandal? Yet here we are. Part of their rapidly evolving line of defense involves Trump giving Michael Cohen a kind of monthly retainer that he could dip into any time somebody needed to be paid off. “These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth,” Trump tweeted.","On Friday, President Trump added to the confusion about payments to Stormy Daniels by stating that everything said “has been said incorrectly.”",2018-05-05T00:43:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Op-Ed Columnist: Don and Rudy, Disaster Twins",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/trump-giuliani-disaster-twins.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/opinion/05collinsWeb/05collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1

The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano has risen to at least 373, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says.
Saturday saw giant waves crash into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. 
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
""1,459 people are injured, while 128 remain missing,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a statement.
Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. 
What warning was given?
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. 
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater.
On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. 
But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.
He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.

The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
How did the tsunami happen?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. 
In other words, it's been part of the background. 
And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.
The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)

In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

ELISA GABBERT,"The phrase “I do,” in the context of a marriage ceremony, is what linguists call a “performative utterance” — words that don’t simply mean or imply but actually enact a change. There are some words powerful enough that, when a president utters them, we might think they amount to a performative utterance, too: For the chief executive to call something a “disaster” in public, for instance, might suggest that a formal disaster declaration will follow. Except lately. During the Oct. 9, 2016, presidential debate, the candidate Donald Trump said “disaster” 17 times. The 17 things that Trump characterized as disasters were, in order: inner cities, Obamacare, single-payer health care plans, Obamacare, Obamacare, Iraq, taxes, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton again, Libya, Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy record, Aleppo, Nafta, Nafta, education, Hillary Clinton’s political performance in upstate New York and jobs. Since that night, he has used the word “disaster” on Twitter with slightly less frequency — just 31 times. Last year there was a record-breaking pileup of multibillion-dollar “megadisasters,” including wildfires, tornadoes and flooding, but only three of the president’s tweets referred to such events. “Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.,” he wrote in one, after Hurricane Irma. “A real disaster, much work to do!” The oddly cheerful tone of this tweet aside, the word “real” was an interesting addition, a seeming acknowledgment of the distance between a true disaster and Trump’s preferred, mostly rhetorical usage, which designates its recipient as a laughable mess, a high-profile embarrassment. Merriam-Webster does offer two contemporary definitions for disaster. One is “a sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or destruction,” as in “natural disasters.” The other is more hyperbolic, in the Trumpian sense: “a sudden or great misfortune or failure,” as in (the dictionary’s example) “The party was a disaster.” This second flavor leaves plenty of room for subjective evaluation of the failure in question. It puts disaster in the eye of the beholder.",It has little to do with lives lost or damage done — and everything to do with the stories we want to tell about ourselves.,2018-04-10T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",First Words: What Separates Ordinary Bad News From True ‘Disaster’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/magazine/what-separates-ordinary-bad-news-from-true-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/magazine/15mag-firstwords/15mag-15firstwords-t_CA0-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months. Now the 900,000 people who settled in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar are facing another threat: heavy rain and landslides as the monsoon season picks up. The monsoon has been dubbed one of the most important climate patterns in the world. The rains spread from southeast to northwest over the course of the summer, nourishing fields across South Asia that provide food for many of the 1.76 billion people who live there. But they also pose an existential threat to refugees. As the refugee camps swelled, the forests in and around them quickly vanished as people sought wood for housing and building fires to cook. Makeshift structures of bamboo and tarps sprung up. Ditches were also dug for sanitation. Now with the onset of monsoon season, the haphazard infrastructure and lack of ground cover has put people living in the camps in grave danger as the rains have picked up. “Last week there was a strong monsoon depression over North Bay of Bengal which cause heavy rains over Cox Bazar area,” Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, told Earther. The United Nations reported that more than 15 inches of rain fell between Sunday and Tuesday, the equivalent of what normally falls over 20 days in June. With no trees to slow the runoff, 37 landslides occurred that affected 11,000 people. The Guardian indicates at least three are dead following the rains. Aerial mapping done by the United Nations shows an estimated 200,000 refugees could be at risk of landslides and floods, and more than 41,000 of them are living in areas with a high risk of landslides. In addition to the physical dangers, waterborne diseases are a growing risk, particularly without adequate sanitation. Acharya said the forecast for the rest of the monsoon season indicates increased odds of more rainfall that normal. That increases the risk of landslides, which is why the United Nations is pushing ahead for what they’re referring to as “mid-term shelters” with concrete moorings built on flat ground that can withstand the heavy rains and some landslides. “We need government approval for mid-term shelters and in view of the current weather and urgency to quickly provide more shelters to relocate families most at risk of landslides, we are focussing [sic] on this right now,” Caroline Gluck, a senior public information officer with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Cox’s Bazar, told Earther. The agency has also been working to help get families upgraded shelter kits including tarps, wire, rope, and bamboo. These kits have been supplied to more than 185,000 households. While they offer a modicum more security against the rains, they’re no match for landslides or winds that could come if a tropical cyclone hits the camp—a distinct risk. According to data maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 63 tropical systems have passed within 100 nautical miles of Cox’s Bazar. The most recent to make a nearby landfall was a tropical depression that hit in October 2011. One of the biggest impediments to speeding the whole process up is money. Earlier this year, the United Nations requested $951 million to “meet the immediate needs of more than 880,000 refugees and over 330,000 Bangladeshis in communities affected by the crisis.” Of that $136.6 million would be used for shelters. To date, only 13 percent of that funding has been provided.","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Maddie Stone to Gizmodo","By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of the most vulnerable among us. A landmark report released on Sunday sets the clock ticking for humanity and its quest to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlines what a world warmed by 1.5 degree Celsius would look like compared with the 2 degree Celsius warmer world enshrined in the Paris Agreement, and the pathways to get there. It shows that a 1.5 degree warmer world is much less brutal than a 2 degree warmer one, and that we have a lot of work to do in a very limited time in order to achieve it. If we fail, the poorest among us will suffer the most. Our world has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius since the start of our carbon pollution bender. Based this observation and physics, scientists have crafted a carbon budget for meeting the 1.5 degree Celsius goal. In the new report, they lay out the pathways to get there. In the most hopeful scenario, innovations in efficiency and technology spur huge drops in energy demand, speeding along decarbonization of the energy system and obviating the need for unproven carbon capture technology. In another, nations harmoniously comes together and we shift to a more sustainable lifestyle and buy less tchotchke. We need a little carbon capture to help do some mop up, but with the kumbaya spirit, anything is possible. If technological innovation or emissions continue on their current trajectory, though, efforts to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius become dicier. Well need more carbon capture, more reforestation and more converting crops to biofuels that sequester carbon. In one scenario, the world would have to convert slightly less than the equivalent of the entire U.S. into a biofuel sacrifice zone. All scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 degrees require massive global investments: on the order of $2.4 trillion annually from 2016-2035. For comparison, the world spent roughly $280 billion installing renewable energy last year. Were talking an order of magnitude more commitment on top of rejiggering the entire global economy, though one that could come with massive financial upside. These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors, the report states. But the scientists who wrote the report are undeterred. In fact, the granular nature of the report, which looked at over 6,000 studies, white papers, and policy documents, is a helpful way to think about the various levers we have at our disposal to address carbon pollution. Theres a perspective that somehow theres one solution to climate change. Theres not, Kristie Ebi, a University of Washington scientist and lead author the summary for policymakers of the new report, told Earther. Theres a million solutions. When you look at each one of these, they can be relatively small. Its when you put them together that become large and powerful. The report also makes a powerful moral argument for reducing emissions, as well as the inevitable adaptation efforts that will be necessary. Page after page, it lays out how the poor will disproportionately suffer from global warming and how much of a difference a half a degree could make. The reports authors note that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050. We often talk about 2 degrees of warming as safe. But what 2 degrees really means is that we lose coral, see massive ecological upheaval, ocean acidification, and multiple feet of sea level rise. Its a few threads away from the complete unraveling of a planetary fabric thats allowed humans to thrive. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will still result in planet-wide suffering. Instead of losing all coral with 2 degrees Celsius, the report shows well lose 70-90 percent of them. Most low-lying islands will become uninhabitable. Both scenarios call for courage and hard work to avert the worst while still preparing to deal with some awful things. And well know if were on track in 12 years time. To keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, emissions will have to drop roughly 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030. All of us can make some lifestyle choices to start to bend the curve. But its largely government policies and actions to address the larger economic system today thatll set the course for humanity. The world 50 years ago was different from today, Natalie Mahowald, another lead author of the report from Cornell University, said. In 50 years, its going to be very different. This is our chance to decide what that world will look like. Unfortunately, good decision making has been in short supply at this crucial juncture. The Trump administrationwhich heads the worlds largest historical emitteris using the argument that a million actions are needed to address climate change to justify precisely the opposite as well as its intent to pull out of the Paris Agreement. Speaking of, most countries arent on track to meet their wholly inadequate pledges to the agreement. Current policies will result in a world thats up to 3.7 degree Celsius (a devilish 6.66 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by 2100, upping the risk that well have to put more eggs in the carbon capture basket or the even more disconcerting reflecting sunlight back into space to cool the planet basket. Kumbaya feels a long ways away. The new report comes two months before the next major international climate conference will be held in Poland. That conference is meant to outline how governments will ramp up actions to address climate change. While Im not naive enough to think a single report alone will change the course of history, Im glad that world leaders will have a reminder of the stakes of their actions.","By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of the most vulnerable among us.

KIRK SEMPLE,"The militarys handling of the throng at the pipeline revealed what he called a lack of technical capacity and policy, and said the troops should have been better prepared to handle the situation.
The circumstances in which the tragedy happened where you have massive theft, in the middle of a national battle against fuel theft made clear he doesnt know where to draw the line between protecting people and continuing the fight against the bad guys, Mr. Navalón said.
As part of the crackdown, which was launched in December, the administration shut down oft-targeted pipelines, shifting the transportation of fuel to tanker trucks. But that tactic caused distribution problems and widespread shortages at service stations.
Survivors of the pipeline explosion and other witnesses said some of the victims had gone to the pipeline rupture with their gasoline canisters because shortages had left them without fuel for their vehicles.
The widespread supply problems have left some observers with the sense the López Obrador administration had launched the crackdown without adequate planning.

ALAN HENRY,"You probably already know that you should keep supplies and an emergency kit on hand for the most common types of emergencies your community may face, but those kits are designed to be helpful only for the first hours or days — ideally just long enough for you to get help or for help to get to you. Even if you have a sizable stockpile of supplies, you’re going to need help from other people sooner rather than later. Mr. Stripling said that most search and rescue after a disaster is done by people in their communities, long before professionals arrive. However, a lot of the support structures that foster the sense of community that led people to look out for one another have degraded, Mr. Stripling said, and it’s up to individuals to bring them back to life. “We have fewer stores and more social media addicts — and that’s tough from a preparedness standpoint since disasters are inherently geographical,” he said. “In a disaster, more people will survive if your neighborhood is resilient — tightly connected, with lots of knowledge about who lives there and lots of strong institutions. ” Photo Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times Before you go knocking on doors however, make a plan — not about how you’ll persuade your neighbors exactly, but what you’ll actually ask of them. How to get started Instead of going door-to-door to rally neighbors, you’ll find more success if you piggyback on existing institutions to organize people in times of need, Mr. Stripling said. “Disaster research shows that tight-knit communities with strong, locally driven organizations respond better in disaster situations,” he said. “That means that any work you do to build community, from strengthening a P.T.A. to starting a local business that serves as a community hub, will naturally help your neighborhood be better prepared. “That’s a key point to focus on. These civic institutions or schools or churches not only enrich our lives day to day, they help to save our lives when disaster strikes. And many of them are not as strong as they used to be.” In short, don’t reinvent the wheel. There’s little need to build something you’ll then have to persuade people to come to when you could get involved with a local P.T.A., sports team, church, book club or neighborhood watch. Mr. Stripling even suggested getting involved with a local coffee shop, day care, or just a group of friends you get drinks with periodically if you can’t find a community group to join. Your next step is to put disaster prep on the agenda of the group you’ve connected with. That doesn’t mean taking over or dragging out a stodgy set of doom-and-gloom talking points. Try to have fun, Mr. Stripling said. “You can schedule a disaster-focused P.T.A. meeting, or a bar trivia night about disasters. Honestly, people do that!” he said. “Your local coffee shop could host a Godzilla Awareness Party. Your small group can help bring people in using an ‘each one reach one’ approach around the neighborhood — and most localities have emergency management teams that would be thrilled to speak at an event like that.” Photo Credit Bryan Oller/Associated Press What to include in your community disaster plan Once you have a group of interested people and a venue to get everyone talking, it’s time to start thinking about what your community’s plan will include. That said, don’t get caught up in the specifics. The point is to get people aware of the possible disasters your community will face, and get them ready and willing to help and take care of one another in a crisis. “The most important thing to understand is that planning for these sorts of things is about the process, not any final document,” Mr. Stripling explained. “Because disasters are chaotic, you’re probably not going to have a lot of reading time, right? So, it’s important to get your group ready to improvise. Building your group into a team that can react to different types of events is more important than being ready to run any one evacuation plan.” He outlined three major components of a good community disaster prep plan: 1. Make sure everyone has more than one way to reach one another. Cellphone numbers are great, but remember that in an emergency, cellular networks will probably be overloaded. If you have a signal but can’t place a mobile call, text messages and walkie-talkie apps use far less mobile data and are more likely to get through. In every case, however, old-fashioned landlines are ideal, since they can be used without power. Mr. Stripling also suggested that getting into amateur or HAM radio is helpful, especially for times when traditional communication networks are down. Finally, don’t forget old-fashioned rendezvous points. If you have no communications at all, it’s critical to have a spot everyone knows to meet up just to make sure everyone is safe. 2. Learn about the hazards and most likely disasters in your area. Not every region is prone to the same types of disasters. If you live on the coast, make sure you talk about plans for coastal storms and flooding. If you live in the Midwest, make sure you’re all on the same page about tornadoes and catastrophic storms. Western state residents may want to talk about mudslides and wildfires. Everyone should probably discuss things like terrorism or other man-made disasters. In every case, people respond better in an emergency if they’ve talked about possible threats before they occur. “It’s also incredibly important to understand that disasters don’t impact people equally — they tend to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities,” Mr. Stripling said. “So you need to understand the vulnerabilities in your neighborhood — things like poverty, housing discrimination or unequal transportation access — since these elements often point to where the worst consequences will occur.” 3. Understand your neighborhood and how your neighbors can help one another. If everyone is going to rely on one another, think about what is convenient and makes sense for each person. “Maybe one neighbor runs a store and could help stock food supplies for the whole team, and another has a vacation home or relative’s house that could serve as a rendezvous point,” Mr. Stripling said. “The neighbor who lives within walking distance of the school could be in charge of kid pickup if transportation goes down. Or someone owns an S.U.V. or boat that could help evacuation procedures. Everyone brings something to the table — and the more diversity your team has, the more powerful it will be.” Ideally, everyone in your community will be willing to pitch in with their own unique skills, abilities and perspectives to help everyone stay safe and protected. Additionally, while everyone should pool resources in a way that makes sense, you should all be willing to back one another up, even if it doesn’t seem like a particular role is your best fit. If the neighbor responsible for kid pickup is out of town when a blizzard hits, someone else should be ready to step in. Best of all, the closer and more tight knit you are before a disaster, the more you’ll be willing to cover the gaps when one happens. Be ready before help arrives Most of us are taught that in an emergency, first responders like police officers, emergency medical personnel and firefighters will be the first ones to get there and help victims. In reality, bystanders and neighbors are usually first — and in the best position to help save lives — especially after a disaster significant enough that it may take time for those emergency workers to arrive. Mr. Stripling suggested reading the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s “ Until Help Arrives ” program and sharing it with your community group. Similarly, he pointed to the New York City Health Department’s Bystander Training Course as another useful resource even for people who don’t live in New York. Keep in mind that most disasters are much worse for people who are already the most at risk. For example, elderly neighbors, people who live alone, or people with disabilities that make evacuation difficult. Make sure people in your group know who in the area may need a helping hand if disaster strikes, and check in on them or be ready to help them evacuate. Mr. Stripling also noted that this extends beyond storms, earthquakes or catastrophic events. Consider that extreme heat waves or cold snaps claim more lives every year than many other “traditional” disasters, and plan to take care of one another accordingly.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

TRIP GABRIEL,"“They railroaded him,” said Steve Blair, a retiree who worked in mines run by Mr. Blankenship when he was the chief executive of the Massey Energy Company, once the largest coal producer in central Appalachia. “The federal government turned everybody loose to testify against him, just to get rid of him.” Mr. Blair, 61, wearing a West Virginia University cap, forked up his steak and eggs at a Bob Evans restaurant recently in Logan. The town, once a Democratic stronghold, is emblematic of how vehemently voters in Appalachia have rejected the national party: Mr. Blair voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but four years later, the sitting president lost the Democratic primary in Logan County to a protest candidate in a Texas prison. A burly man who is certain in his views, Mr. Blair had a ready explanation for the long decline of the coal industry. “One word: Obama,” he said. “I was put out of business by Obama.” Mr. Blankenship claims that the federal government, not the coal company, is to blame for the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine near Montcoal, W.Va. Investigators found no evidence to support his claims, but he is running for office in an era of nationwide voter credulity for conspiracy theories. And his candidacy is unfolding in a state where many people embrace a sense of persecution over coal’s decline. Economists say that a host of factors are responsible, chiefly the abundance of cheap natural gas, which has undercut coal in the energy marketplace. But that is not what many West Virginians choose to hear. “What hurt coal was the Obama administration and nothing else,” said Denny Harton, a retired business owner who introduced Mr. Blankenship recently at one of his rallies. Photo The explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch Coal Mine near Montcoal, W. Va., the state’s deadliest mine accident in decades, killed 29 miners. Emergency workers responded to the scene in April 2010. Credit Jeff Gentner/Associated Press Dianne Dewey White, chairwoman of the Republican Party of Logan County, said thousands of miners who once looked to Mr. Blankenship for work are likely to support him now. “You wouldn’t believe what good parties they had, and what times they had,” she said. “They spent a lot of good years with him. People don’t forget that.” Coal barons like Mr. Blankenship used to be despised in Logan County, a rugged region in southern West Virginia. The Battle of Blair Mountain happened here in 1921, when miners seeking to unionize clashed with a private army fielded by mine owners, and more than 50 people died. But as West Virginia has become a deep-red state, the sympathies of many mine families have shifted from unions to mine operators, who are portrayed as job creators. “I have heard people say, ‘When Don was in charge, we always worked,’” said R. Booth Goodwin II, who prosecuted Mr. Blankenship as a United States attorney and then ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2016. “The coal industry is still perpetuating a lie that coal mining is coming back, and it’s going to be just like it was before, when all objective evidence is to the contrary,” he said. Mr. Blankenship, 67, is up against two more conventional candidates — Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins — in the Republican primary in May. He said he is prepared to spend whatever it takes on the race, and his pockets are deep: In his last years at Massey Energy, he was reportedly paid $38.2 million. Opponents who once dismissed his candidacy now see him as a credible threat in the Trump era, positioned to appeal to many West Virginians’ resentment of elites of any kind. “There’s a pride in the state, deep inside, that comes from people dumping on it so long,” said an aide to Senator Joe Manchin III, the Democratic incumbent who will face the winner of the Republican primary in November. Mr. Manchin once said that Mr. Blankenship “has blood on his hands” because of Upper Big Branch, the worst mining disaster in the United States in 40 years. Some West Virginians speculate that Mr. Blankenship is running to pursue a vendetta against Mr. Manchin, who was governor at the time the mine exploded. Although Mr. Manchin is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, he is still expected to face a tough re-election race in the state, where Donald J. Trump won 68 percent of the vote in 2016. Mr. Blankenship dismisses talk of a vendetta. “If I wanted to get Senator Manchin, I’d just go out and slam him, like he did me, put national TV ads on,” he said in an interview. “I’m trying to win an election.” Through a spokesman, Mr. Manchin declined to be interviewed. “Out of respect for our coal miners and their families who are still grieving the loss of their loved ones, I will not comment on Don Blankenship,’’ he said in a statement. “West Virginians know the facts, and the jury has spoken.” Mr. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor count of conspiracy in 2015 after the jury heard that federal safety inspectors had written hundreds of safety violations for the Upper Big Branch mine, and former miners described unsafe conditions there. On the campaign trail, Mr. Blankenship charges that “the Obama government blew up the Upper Big Branch mine.” He maintains that the explosion happened because federal inspectors had ordered the company to install an ineffective ventilation system. Photo A memorial in Whitesville, W.Va., dedicated to the miners who died in the Upper Big Branch disaster. Some relatives of the victims have been critical of Mr. Blankenship’s Senate run. Credit Ty Wright for The New York Times None of the several investigations conducted by state, federal and independent authorities support Mr. Blankenship’s theory on the mine disaster. Instead, investigators found that mine management failed to prevent a combustible buildup of coal dust, which was ignited by faulty machinery to create a fireball. After completing his prison time at the Taft Correctional Institution in California, Mr. Blankenship declared in court papers that his primary residence was in Las Vegas. The car that brought him to a recent appearance in Parkersburg, W.Va., was a luxury BMW sedan with Tennessee plates. To many relatives of the miners who were killed, his re-emergence in coal country is a source of bitter pain. Gary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship’s TV ads, titled “For the Sake of Coal Miners.” “We’re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV — that’s sickening,” said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines. “Don can say what he wants to about safety and doing all this and that for miners — there was no safety in Massey coal. None whatever.” “All they know is to lie, cheat and outlaw,” he added. At a barbershop on Main Street in Logan, the county seat, customers with ties to mining tended to react negatively to Mr. Blankenship’s candidacy, while the barber, Chad Browning, was studiedly neutral. “Coal is king in this county,” said Mr. Browning, 45. “There’s nothing else here.” In his shop in the former bus station, a haircut is $10 and a poster for a Kiwanis pancake breakfast is taped to the mirror. The street outside is a shadowy canyon of tired brick buildings, with a tattoo parlor nearby and a pawnshop offering “Loans, Guns, Ammo.” Only one UPS truck stops to make deliveries on Main Street these days, Mr. Browning said, where once there were three. The UPS driver, Mike Workman, 46, the son of a coal miner, watched Mr. Browning apply hot lather to a customer and shave his neck with a straight razor. Mr. Workman lamented how the conflict over coal, between protecting jobs and protecting the environment, had become so bitter. “It’s a political war, but to us it’s not a political war — we’re just trying to make a living,” he said. “I don’t think there’s nobody in West Virginia that wants to see the streams tainted. I’m a fisherman and a hunter. We love this area. This is where our kids play. We drink the water here.” He said he could not vote for Mr. Blankenship. “I’ve had family in the mining industry; they know that he puts production above safety,” he said. In the barber’s chair, Bob Lucas, 52, who works in a coal processing plant, said he could not support Mr. Blankenship, either. Mr. Lucas was once an electrician at a Massey-owned mine, where he said he was asked to take shortcuts that would compromise safety. Rather than do that, he said, he quit the job. Mr. Lucas said the mine’s managers lived in fear of a visit from Mr. Blankenship, who would descend on the site by helicopter. “When Don flew in, they were terrified,” he said.

Andrew Liptak,"Last year, Airbnb unveiled a program called Open Homes, designed to allow Airbnb hosts to provide emergency housing after a disaster. Homeowners can allow refugees or evacuees to find housing on a short notice — for free. The company is now expanding that program (via Techcrunch ) with a pilot project that will allow hosts to list their properties ahead of a disaster. The idea is to streamline the response to a disaster by allowing hosts to sign up in advance, so that when a disaster does strike, those in need don’t necessarily have to wait for said hosts to come forward in the aftermath. Presently, the program matches up users willing to donate space with emergency managers, who can then connect people who need housing with available space. Airbnb hopes that having a list prior to a disaster will allow for a quicker response from its users. The program also comes with some “in person preparedness training and recruitment events” for hosts, as well as a marketing campaign and new protocols for communicating with local emergency management to match up available space with those who need it. Airbnb made the announcement at this year’s US Conference of Mayors Annual Meeting in Boston. The pilot project is launching first with the city of San Jose, California, and the company says that it’ll be looking to expand to other cities as well. Given the rocky relations that the company has with some cities, the project has the ability to create a considerable amount of goodwill: it says that since the program launched in 2017, its collective community has donated 17,000 nights for those in need.","Last year, Airbnb unveiled a program called Open Homes, designed to allow Airbnb hosts to open their homes to those in need after an emergency.

George Dvorsky,"This past Saturday, a tanker transporting oil from Iran to South Korea collided with a freighter about 160 miles off the coast of Shanghai. The tanker, filled with 130 tons of highly volatile condensate crude, has been burning for the past three days, raising fears of an environmental catastrophe. As Reuters reports, the tanker, named Sanchi, collided with a Hong Kong-registered freighter off China’s eastern coast. The tanker’s crew of 32 are missing; one unidentified body has been recovered. The freighter, which was carrying U.S. grain, experienced little damage, and all 21 of its crew members have been rescued. The Sanchi, owned by National Iranian Tanker Co, was en route to South Korea when the collision happened. The tanker has been burning for three straight days as rescue crews struggle to bring the blaze under control. It’s filled with 136,000 tons (about 1 million barrels) of highly volatile condensate oil worth about $60 million, reports Reuters. If a spill happens, it would be the worst oil spill since 1991, when 260,000 tons of oil spilled off the Angolan coast. Officials don’t yet know whether condensate has leaked from the tanker. Officials with China’s Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety did not say when the fire might be put out. Bad weather and toxic fumes are making it difficult for crews to access the tanker. As noted, the ship is filled with an ultra-light crude condensate— a type of oil that condenses into a liquid after it’s extracted (the condensate in the Sanchi came from crude oil). Condensates are used to produce products like petrol, jet fuel, and heating fuels. It’s colorless and odorless, but more flammable than conventional oil. “Gas condensates represent the ‘light ends’ of oil—that is, the low molecular weight compounds that are highly volatile and flammable, and very similar to gasoline,” Peter Hodson, a professor in the Department of Biology and School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University, told Gizmodo via email. “The hazards from a spill include fire and explosion (the circumstance at the site of the accident) and rapid mortality of any surface animals (marine birds and marine mammals), or fish and invertebrates just underneath the surface (top 10 meters of water).” Hodson says that, as long as the condensates continue to be released from the ship, the risk of these effects will be very high. But once the ship stops leaking (when it’s emptied of oil), these risks will decrease quickly. That’s because condensates evaporate and are diluted in air, and the condensates dissolved in water will be rapidly diluted to below the threshold of toxicity. “The risk to oil spill responders is obviously high during the spill and fire, and if there is no one left on the ship, it may be simplest to let it burn out,” added Hodson. “However, the heat of the fire may destroy the hull, allowing heavy fuel oil in the ship’s tanks to leak. The heavy fuel oil is also flammable, and could burn if exposed to the condensate fire—surface slicks at the Deepwater Horizon spill were treated with burning agents to reduce their size. If the heavy oil leaks, it will create the typical conditions that we associate with traditional ship wrecks, i.e., a heavy black oil slick, oil coating of birds and marine mammals, and a residue that may ultimately contaminate shorelines or sink and contaminate bottom sediments.” Babatunde Anifowosem, a senior lecturer in petroleum and environmental technology at the University of Coventry in the UK, told CNN that an explosion would be the worst outcome. After a blast, the oil would seep out beneath the surface of the water, making cleanup much more difficult, he said. An explosion would also spread more toxic fumes, which could spread inland and trigger respiratory problems among vulnerable populations. According to Reuters, China has sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, while South Korea has sent a helicopter. U.S. Navy military craft have also been brought into help with the rescue operations. The cause of the collision is still not known, but the Sanchi was traveling in waters not frequently traversed by large vessels, which typically travel closer to the Chinese coast or nearer to Japan.

 The blast ripped open a whole section of the block of flats
It was New Year's Eve and families were fast asleep when an explosion tore through their apartment block, bringing down 10 storeys in a matter of seconds.
Forty-eight flats were destroyed in this no-frills 1970s building typical of communist Soviet-era housing. 
""The roar woke me up and my husband shouted,"" said Yelena Kruglyakova, asleep with her husband and three-year-old son in a flat on the fourth floor.
""I rushed to the sofa-bed. It was broken and part of the floor had collapsed into the flat below. My little boy was dangling over the edge, clinging on to the bedsheet.""
Somehow the boy clawed his way up the sheet to safety and the family survived.
Thirty-nine people did not, when the block came crashing down in an apparent gas explosion shortly after 06:00 in Magnitogorsk, a bleak industrial city in Russia's Urals region.

The temperature was below -20C as shivering, dazed survivors picked their way out of the rubble in their night clothes.
Instead of celebrating the New Year, the city was plunged into mourning.
Even without such disasters life is tough in Magnitogorsk, 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow. In the 1930s Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin made it a steel production centre, closed to foreigners. 
Now the city is struggling with heavy pollution, chronic traffic jams and industrial decline.

 Flats adjacent to the devastated block were also damaged by the blast
For days the number of casualties climbed as rescuers searched the collapsed building for the missing. 
Anxious relatives had to endure a painfully long wait.
It was dangerous, painstaking work as bodies were brought out of the mountain of rubble.

Miraculously an 11-month-old boy, critically ill, was found after more than 30 hours in the freezing cold. Ivan is now recovering in intensive care in a Moscow hospital. 
But tragically just a handful of others were pulled out alive of a block that had been home to 120 people.
The official list of fatalities only appeared on 3 January.

 The mountain of debris was a daunting challenge for rescuers
Officials quickly ruled out foul play, blaming the explosion on a gas leak. No traces of explosive were found.
Six young children were among the 39 dead, including three from one family from Tajikistan. 
Only the father survived: Shukhrat Ulfatov, 26, was severely hurt and is now reported to be in a coma. 
He had been buried in the rubble for about eight hours.
His 24-year-old wife Rajabmo died along with three-year-old Mukhamad, Fotima who was four, and Akhmat, aged six.
Twenty-one of the victims were women.

Viktor and Tatyana Antilov, in their 30s, died with their 19-month-old daughter Ulyana.
The sixth young child who died was Danil Tinibayev, aged four and a half. 
Two brothers in their 30s - Denis and Dmitry Kremlyov - died along with their parents Yelena and Andrei.

 A makeshift memorial at the scene will be replaced eventually by a permanent one
A rescue team called Legion-SPAS published the victims' birthdates on VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook.
Olga Skvortsova, a 43-year-old music teacher, died in the flat of a friend, who had left for work just before the blast happened. 
Another friend of Olga's, quoted by the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, remembered her as a cheerful, hard-working and self-reliant person. Now Olga's teenage daughter Katya has to cope with funeral arrangements.
Traumatised survivors are being sheltered at a local school and have received warm clothes. 
The local Chelyabinsk region is giving the families of those killed 1m-rouble (£11,600; $14,700) assistance payments. 
As the search for survivors came to an end on Thursday there was some good news from the disaster scene. Rescuers found a dog and a cat and brought them to safety.

 The dog was found in the rubble four days after the blast
Gas explosions are quite common in Russia, which struggles with much infrastructure dating from the communist era. But this was a cruelly devastating one.
A survivor called Zoya said that the loud bang woke her up, but she thought something had fallen down in her mother's room, next door.
""Mum said 'the block has collapsed'. I just thought she was being plagued by childhood memories of the war,"" Zoya said. 
""I even started arguing with her, I thought it could be a firecracker. So I went back to sleep, but then acquaintances phoned us and said our block of flats had collapsed,"" she said.

Johnny Lieu,"There's always a story out there you can't make up. It certainly applies to The Disaster Artist, which is based on the true story of the ever-enigmatic Tommy Wiseau and his best-worst movie ever, The Room. SEE ALSO: A delightful side-by-side comparison of 'The Room' and 'The Disaster Artist' The writers behind The Disaster Artist, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, unpacked the truth behind the film in an interview with Slashfilm. Much of the film was based off The Room actor Greg Sestero's memoir, but the writers also listened to audio recordings made by Wiseau, and watched behind-the-scenes footage from the making of The Room. Still, test audiences who watched the film weren't so convinced the film was based on a true story, according to Neustadter. ""I think we were fascinated by the real. In this particular case – I guess in most cases – the real is way more interesting than anything we’re going to come up with. It's crazy. It’s funny, because when we were testing this movie initially with an audience of people, the one thing that they said at the end, which we couldn’t believe, was that they didn’t think any of this was true."" It seems like the pairing of Seth Rogen and James Franco in The Disaster Artist didn't help their case. ""Even though it says, ‘Based on a True Story,’ they just thought it was another Franco/Rogen [project], making something up and a funny character they were doing. The side by sides — some people still watch this movie and cannot believe, until the side-by-sides, that there is footage out there like what we shot. So that’s something that I think we, in telling the story, were cognizant of. Truth is stranger than fiction. Let’s lean in on more of what actually went down. And there are enough mysteries that go unanswered that we kept in the soufflé also."" There's also apparently enough material from Sestero's book to make a ""six-hour miniseries,"" combined with the writers' experience of watching Franco direct in character as Wiseau, all while keeping the accent. Even that sounds too good to be true.","There's always a story out there you can't make up.

But it will take airlines some time to test the new software and restore the trust of customers leery about the Max, given two fatal crashes within half a year.
In a statement released on Twitter after the news conference on Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said pilots on the doomed flight had followed emergency procedures recommended by Boeing and approved by the F.A.A.
It was very unfortunate that they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nose diving, the airline said.
In the news conference, however, Ms. Moges, the transport minister, cautioned against holding any party responsible for the planes fatal plunge.
The major objective of this investigation is to make sure that there is safety in the aviation sector, she said.

Well hopefully soon there's going to be some more Fyre Festival content to gobble up — Hulu is in the early stages of developing a docuseries about the self-described luxury music festival with the help of Billboard, Mic, and The Cinemart. It's expected to come out in 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported Monday. SEE ALSO: The internet is having trouble feeling sorry for the folks at Fyre Festival If you missed the hubbub about the pseudo-festival from last spring, or need a refresher, here's how it went down: People paid exorbitant amounts of money (read: $12,000 for the weekend) to attend the Fyre Festival, which was organized by Fyre Media owner Billy McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule. It was supposed to be a luxurious weekend filled with music from bands like Blink-182 and top-tier food, all on an island in the Bahamas. Except almost everything outside of the fact that it took place on an island turned out to be false. The food was abysmal, Blink-182 pulled out thanks to lack of payment, and the lodgings and amenities might as well have been non-existent. It was so bad that Fyre Media was investigated by the FBI, and the founder, McFarland, was arrested and charged with wire fraud. The Hulu docuseries will attempt to get to bottom of exactly where and how everything went wrong with the Fyre Festival with in-depth interviews. According to THR, everyone from local Bahamians, attendees, and employees will be interviewed along with never-before-seen footage and insider information.","The Fyre Festival was one of those disasters that the world collectively couldn't keep its eyes off of, with the internet gobbling up every detail and horror story that came out of the debacle with feverish abandon.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Sewol tragedy shocked South Korea A South Korean court has ruled the government has to pay compensation for the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. It is the first time a court has acknowledged the state is liable for the deaths. The Sewol sank in 2014 killing 304 people, most of them school children. Some relatives of the victims had turned down an earlier offer of compensation, insisting the state's responsibility had to be proven. ""The court acknowledges the liability in compensating the plaintiffs, since the negligence by the state and Cheonghaejin Marine Co. has resulted in the occurrence of the accident,"" the court said on Thursday, Yonhap news agency reported. The court awarded 200m won ($177,000, £135,000) in compensation for each passenger who died. Parents of the students who lost their lives in the tragedy will receive a further 40 million won. Siblings and grandparents are to get smaller sums in compensation. Image copyright EPA Image caption Victims' relatives want more answers why the tragedy happened Investigators said the vessel was structurally unsound, overloaded and travelling too fast. It capsized while crossing to the island of Jeju on 16 April 2014. In 2015, the government offered to pay $380,000 (£256.000; €353,000) in compensation for each of the nearly 250 students who died. Many of the families rejected that offer as it would have meant an end to the investigations into the case. The tragedy shocked the country, with much of the public's anger directed at the government over poor safety standards and rescue work. The boat's captain has been jailed for 36 years for gross negligence.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionCyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air
Mozambique's port city of Beira is reeling from the damage inflicted by Cyclone Idai.
So far 200 people have been confirmed dead in the southern African country, but the death toll could be much higher.
Those who survived the disaster have had little reprieve to mourn the loss of their loved ones or salvage the little that is remaining of their belongings. They are in desperate need of food, shelter and clothing, as the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports.
Inside a makeshift response centre at the airport in Beira, aid agencies are scrambling to get to those still trapped across the region. 
It's the first point of call for all the teams coming in from around the world and offers the first glimpse of how heavily this operation is relying on outside help. 
A few kilometres away, panic is setting in. The people of Beira are growing anxious - help is coming, but it is really slow and not nearly enough.
""I have nothing. I have lost everything. We don't have food. I don't even have blankets. We need help,"" one woman tells me as we make our way through the village of Manhava. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Most of the port city of Beira is under water
Beira's geography, with parts of it lying below sea level, has always made it vulnerable to effects of extreme weather like Cyclone Ida which made landfall last week with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph).
The city bore the full brunt of the destructive storm, which triggered flooding of the whole city and knocked down buildings and cut off roads. The latter is now stalling rescuers from reaching desperate people in need. 
More on Cyclone Idai: 
Some people here are trying to salvage what they can to create shelter. Those who can are repairing their metal roofs, while others are tying together pine branches to sleep under. 
Homes have been damaged, some even completely destroyed, and there are pools of water everywhere. 
A local church has become a temporary home for scores of people. Half of its roof was blown off, but the walls have held and to some it is better than being out in the cold. 
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Floodwaters have cut off roads and knocked down buildings
The UN has said that Cyclone Idai triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa, affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. 
Neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi have also been affected by the freak storm that has caused the deaths of dozens and displacement of thousands of people.
Everyone we come across here is begging us to come into their homes to show us what they have lost and how nature has stolen from them.
We are the first people they have seen since the cyclone hit a few days ago. 
""Please help us. Tell the world we are suffering. We don't know where we are going to sleep,"" says Pedro, a father of three children all under the age of 10. 
The residents here feel like they have been forgotten. 
'100,000 people at risk'
As the full picture of this crisis slowly becomes clear, there are questions about whether the government of Mozambique could have done more to prepare for the disaster. 
The floods of the year 2000 claimed hundreds of lives and yet some here feel lessons have not been learned. 
""Our city was destroyed so easily because our infrastructure is not taken care of. Every time there is a problem here we need foreign countries to save us. What is our government doing, what is our own plan?"" our driver asks me. 
Back at the airport, a helicopter has just landed and rescue workers rush out carrying in their arms children whose eyes are wide with fear.
""Many villages have been washed away. We found women and children holding on to trees. We are doing what we can,"" said one of the rescuers. 
More rains are expected and those who made it to safety are the lucky ones. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk - and there is growing concern that help may not get to them in time.

David Murphy,"A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer. She’ll explain the full details in a bit, but it makes me grateful for complicated backup setups. Anyway, let’s go put the world’s biggest Band-Aid on a potential technological catastrophe. Lifehacker reader Caroline writes: “Three or four years ago, my Macbook died, and because I was an avid user of Time Machine, I was able to retrieve virtually everything I cared about from my external hard drive, except my photos, because this tragedy happened to coincide with a software update, and thus the updated photos couldn’t access the old photo library that was stored on the other drive. Losing all of the photos from the first 27 years of my life still pains me, even years later, and I’ve kept the external hard drive with everything on it just in case I discover some miraculous way of retrieving this old iPhoto library (doubtful), but how can I prevent it from happening in the future?” Caroline: First, I just wanted to say that I completely sympathize with your issue on this one. I have folders and folders full of unorganized photos that I swear I’ll get to organizing someday—and possibly even backing up to something more than just my network-attached storage device. Regardless, if I were to lose them, I would feel absolutely horrible. And that’s just ten years or so of memories I care about. To lose 27 years’ worth of pictures, especially from the first 27 years of your life... that’s rough. I completely understand that this is something that still haunts you. That said, I’m glad you kept the hard drive, though, because I think there’s a solution to your issue. Though you’ve likely done a bunch of web searching for answers, I presume you haven’t stumbled across the main trick for getting elbow-deep in that library and pulling out all the photos it contains. As Macworld’s Glenn Fleishman wrote in a 2017 article, plug in your external drive, find the photo library, and try these steps: 1. Control-click the iPhoto Library. 2. Choose “Show Package Contents” from the contextual menu. 3. Drag (to move) or Option-drag (to copy) the Masters folder to the Desktop or to another drive. 4. Launch the latest version of iPhoto 9 and import that Masters folder. Or launch Photos and do the same. While this trick will cost you your photos’ metadata, you’ll ideally be able to import them at their full resolutions, which is much more important. Using a tool like this, if I’m right, will make the conversion process easy, but you’ll get lower-quality files. I think. It’s possible that doing the aforementioned trick might not actually show you a folder called “Masters.” That’s fine. As this Reddit post illuminates, you might instead see something called “Originals.” Try using that instead. This should hopefully allow you to import all of your old photos into your latest version of Photos. If you’re having trouble, write me another email and we can try walking through the process together. As for what to do going forward, I recommend synchronizing your photo galleries to the cloud. Whether you do that with Apple and iCloud—and pay for extra storage, I’m guessing, given how many photos you likely have—or a service like Google Photos, which is unlimited and free, is your choice. Dump everything to the cloud, and you’ll never have to worry about photos you can’t access ever again (unless Google or Apple go away someday, but I’m sure you’ll have ample warning for that). You’ll get a lot more peace of mind than just keeping your photos archived on a computer, even a Time Machine backup.","A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,disaster,1
Jon Fingas,"Further upgrades expand fundraiser creation to more regions (including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Europe) and blood donation searches are expanding to Bangladesh.

Adam Rogers,"This past year, 2017, was the worst fire season in American history. Over 9.5 million acres burned across North America. Firefighting efforts cost $2 billion. This past year, 2017, was the seventh-worst Atlantic hurricane season on record and the worst since 2005. There were six major storms. Early estimates put the costs at more than $180 billion. As the preventable disease hepatitis A spread through homeless populations in California cities in 2017, 1 million Yemenis contracted cholera amid a famine. Diphtheria killed 21 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, on the run from a genocide. Disaster, Pestilence, War, and Famine are riding as horsemen of a particular apocalypse. In 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere reached 403 parts per million, higher than it has been since at least the last ice age. By the end of 2017, the United States was on track to have the most billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters since the government started counting in 1980. We did that. Transnational corporations and the most powerful militaries on Earth are already building to prepare for higher sea levels and more extreme weather. The FIRE complex—finance, insurance, and real estate—knows exactly what 2017 cost them ( natural and human-made disasters : $306 billion and 11,000 lives), and can calculate more of the same in 2018. They know that the radical alteration of Earth’s climate isn’t just something that’s going to happen in 100 years if we’re not careful, or in 50 years if we don’t change our economy and moonshot the crap out of science and technology. It’s here. Now. It happened. Look behind you. Let me rephrase: Absent any changes, by 2050 Earth will be a couple degrees hotter overall. Sea levels will be a foot higher. Now, 2050 seems as impossibly far away to me as 2017 did when I was 12 years old. I live in the future! And I like a lot of it. I like the magic glass slab in my pocket and the gene therapy and the robots. I mention this because in 2050, my oldest child will be the same age I am today, and I have given him a broken world. I don’t want that. So 2017 taught a lesson, at last, that scientists and futurists have been screaming about. Humanity has to reduce the amount of carbon it’s pumping into the air. Radically. Or every year will be worse from here on out. But 2017 also made plain the shape of the overall disaster. All those fires and floods and outbreaks are symptoms of the same problem, and it’s time to start dealing with that in a clear-eyed way. It’s also time to start building differently—to start making policies that understand that the American coastline is going to be redrawn by the sea, and that people can’t keep building single-family homes anywhere they can grade a flat pad. The wildland-urban interface can’t keep spreading at will. People can’t keep pumping fresh water out of aquifers without restoring them. Infrastructure for water and power has to be hardened against more frequent, more intense storms, backed up and reinforced so hundreds of thousands of people don’t go without electricity as they are in post-hurricane Puerto Rico. In short: Change, but also adapt. Fire season in the West is now a permanent condition; don’t build buildings that burn so easily in places that burn every year. Hurricanes and storm surges are going to continue to walk up the Caribbean and onto the Gulf Coast, or maybe along the seaboard. Don’t put houses on top of the wetlands that absorb those storms. Don’t insure the people who do. Build ways for people to get around without cars. Create a power grid that pulls everything it can from renewable sources like wind and solar. Keep funding public health research, surveillance, and ways to deal with mosquito-borne diseases that thrive in a hotter world. And the next time someone in a city planning meeting says that new housing shouldn’t get built in a residential area because it’s not in keeping with the sense of the community and might disrupt parking, tell them what that means: that they want young people to have lesser lives, that they don’t want poor people and people of color to have the same opportunities they did, and that they’d rather the planet’s environment get crushed by letting bad buildings spread to inhospitable places than increasing density in cities. This apocalypse doesn't hurt everyone. Some people benefit. It’s not a coincidence that the FIRE industries also donate the most money to federal political campaigns. Rich people living behind walls they think can’t be breached by any rising tide, literal or metaphoric, made this disaster. And then they gaslighted the vulnerable into distrusting anyone raising the alarm. The people who benefit have made it seem as if this dark timeline was all perfectly fine. It isn’t. And that’s why it’ll change. In 1957 Charles Fritz and Harry Williams, the research associate and technical director, respectively, of the National Academy of Sciences’ Disaster Studies Committee, wrote a paper that sparked the field of disaster sociology. Their findings were counterintuitive then, and somehow remain so. People in disasters, they said, don’t loot and riot. They help each other. “The net result of most disasters is a dramatic increase in social solidarity among the affected populace during the emergency and immediate post-emergency periods,” they wrote. “The sharing of a common threat to survival and the common suffering produced by the disaster tend to produce a breakdown of pre-existing social distinctions and a great outpouring of love, generosity, and altruism.” In a disaster, we help each other. The trick is recognizing the disaster. Through that lens, fixing the problem and protecting one another against its consequences isn’t merely inarguable. It’s human nature. We’re all in this together.","The past year was one of the worst on record for natural disasters.

"THOMAS FULLER, KIRK JOHNSON and CONOR DOUGHERTY","One possible solution, she said, would be for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide trailers that people could live in while their homes were being rebuilt. For now, though, authorities are focused on providing immediate relief.

Anthony Ha,"Netflix and Hulu have each released their own documentaries about the infamous Fyre Festival, and the hard-working hosts of the Original Content podcast have watched both of them.
We’re joined this week by Brian Heater, and the three of us are unanimous on one thing: If you’re only going to watch one of these documentaries, make it “Fyre” on Netflix. It’s the better-made movie, offering a clearer retelling of what actually went wrong at the first-time music festival in the Bahamas.
But if you’ve got the time, watching both films will give you a fuller picture. “Fyre Fraud” on Hulu is the one that scored interview with Fyre mastermind Billy McFarland though the interview becomes increasingly awkward as he evades or outright refuses to answer many of the filmmakers’ questions (and they’ve taken heat for apparently paying McFarland for the interview).
More interestingly, the Hulu film makes more of an effort to connect the Fyre Festival to the bigger picture of millennial and influencer culture. In fact, McFarland’s fake-it-till-you-make-it ethos sometimes felt uncomfortably close to what we’ve seen when writing about tech startups.
The Oscar nominations were also announced this week, so we discussed the Best Picture nods received by Netflix’s “Roma” and by “Black Panther” the first superhero film nominated in this category.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Thirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfires to 42, officials say. The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing, as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk. The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts, including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across the state. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for. How did people die? Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving blaze. Paradise and its surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The town of Paradise has been obliterated by the blaze ""It was very scary,"" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones told CNN, recounting her family's escape from the town. ""It took a long time to get out. There was fire on both sides of the car. You could feel the heat coming in through the car,"" she said. Among the victims were also elderly residents with mobility issues or people who decided to stay despite evacuation orders. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Two mobile army morgues are being brought in to help to identify the dead. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Musician Neil Young made the same link, writing on his website: ""I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.""

 The Iolaire had been a luxury yacht before the war
Just weeks after the slaughter of World War One ended, the Hebridean Isle of Lewis was hit by the ""crowning sorrow of the war"". 
In the early hours of 1 January 1919, naval yacht HMY Iolaire, which was carrying sailors returning from the war, hit rocks as it approached Stornoway and sank.
More than 200 people drowned, just yards from the shoreline and the safety of home.
Image caption
 More than 200 died when the Iolaire went down off Lewis
According to local historian Catriona Dunn, Lewis had a hard war with almost 1,000 men dying during the conflict.
She says the islands had already lost a higher proportion of servicemen than most other areas of Britain and this meant the Iolaire disaster was an ""unimaginable horror"".
""Small communities lost a lot of men, on top of losses during the war itself - there was just an unspeakable grief,"" she says.
Many feel that what happened contributed to future emigration from the Western Isles.
Image caption
 John Finlay Macleod managed to get a rope to shore and saved about 40 people
About 75 men managed to survive the sinking.
John Finlay Macleod, from Ness, helped save about 40 of them.
He grabbed a rope, gave one end to a man onboard, and prepared to swim ashore through the violent sea.
Image caption
 John Finlay Macleod, in his 80s, told a BBC documentary about the rescue
Speaking in an interview in 1973, he told how it was not far to the shore but the waves were terrible and pushed him back further than he had been before he started.
Mr Macleod, who was 30 at the time, said he succeeded in getting to the rocks by keeping afloat and then riding in on the crest of the wave.
He was thrown on to the rocks but managed to cling on, establishing a rescue line that others used to get to shore.
Image caption
 Donald Morrison survived by clinging to the mast of the ship
Another survivor, Donald Morrison clung to the mast of the ship all night, awaiting rescue.
He also described what happened in the 1973 documentary. 
""I could see the big sea coming, and I would squeeze myself onto the mast,"" he said.
Image caption
 A photo of what remained of the Iolaire after the tragedy
""I heard a crash, and the other mast had broken, and the two men who were on it had gone too, and there I was all by myself till daybreak.""
The survivors, and the bereaved, sought answers at the time, but a public inquiry into the disaster lasted just two days and many questions remain.
The men who died were mostly Royal Navy reservists who had been serving during the war.
Image caption
 The Iolaire was wrecked just yards from the coast
They had arrived by rail at Kyle of Lochalsh on the western Highlands mainland and were looking forward to catching the steam-ferry home.
The regular ferry, the SS Sheila, was soon packed so the Royal Navy ordered the Iolaire across the Minch from its berth in Stornoway to carry the extra men left behind. 
Image caption
 There is a monument to those who died on Lewis
The Iolaire had been a luxury yacht before the war, sailing under the name of the Amalthaea. 
It was used by the navy in anti-submarine and patrol work and was renamed the Iolaire - Gaelic for ""Eagle"".
Discussions about whether the Iolaire had enough lifeboats and lifejackets were cut short when two more trains arrived at the quay with more men hoping to get home for the new year. 
This meant the master was keen to get the sailors onto the ship.
The Iolaire set sail from Kyle of Lochalsh at about 21:30 in strong winds.
A few miles off Stornoway the weather got much worse and as the Iolaire made its final approach into Stornoway harbour in a strong gale, it is believed the boat changed course at the wrong point.
With the lights of the harbour in sight, the ship struck rocks known as the Beasts of Holm at full speed and immediately began to tilt, filling up with water.
The men were just 20 yards from the shoreline when the Iolaire hit the rocks just before 02:00.
The author of a new book on the disaster, Malcolm Macdonald, says a strengthening wind may have contributed to what happened.
'Minor navigational error'
""I think with the wind behind her, she turned to port and into Stornoway too late,"" Mr Macdonald says.
""It was a minor navigational error, but a catastrophic one as well,"" he says.
Of those known to have died, 174 came from Lewis, with seven Harrismen among the dead. A further 18 crew and two passengers on their way to the Stornoway Naval Base were killed.
At the time of the incident, such was the grief on the island that few families spoke of what happened. 
A hundred years on, attitudes are changing though, according to the Iolaire Working Group. 
'Providence robbed from us'
""Going through school I heard very little about the disaster, people didn't want to talk about it,"" explains Colin George Morrison from the group.
""Young people are certainly more aware of the incident, and hopefully that will continue in the coming years,"" he says.
The commemorations on New Year's Day will mark the culmination of a year of remembrance on the islands through different projects.
On Hogmanay there will be a torchlight procession in Stornoway, with each torch representing a life lost in the disaster.
A special ceremony near the wreck site on 1 January will bring together descendants of those lost, and dignitaries, including representatives of the Royal Family and the Scottish government.
Catriona Dunn, who herself lost relatives in the disaster, feels the events are hugely significant.
""These commemorations are bringing it to people's attention once again. We are mourning again people we never knew,"" she says.
Commenting on the impact on the island community, she added, ""We will never know what providence robbed from us.""",More than 200 sailors returning from WW1 drowned just yards from the shore and the safety of home.,2019-01-01T01:28:16Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The Iolaire disaster: The 'crowning sorrow of the war',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46522918,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96D5/production/_104731683_iolaire-2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,disaster,1

 Some residents have been returning to the area to look at cherry blossom
A Japanese town whose population fled the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster has partially reopened eight years later.
Radiation levels in parts of Okuma, west of the Daiichi plant, have been deemed safe for residents to return.
About 50 people have begun moving back to areas in the town where decontamination efforts were focused.
The plant was hit by a tsunami, causing the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
Critics have accused the Japanese government of expediting residents' return in an attempt to showcase safety standards ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Okuma's 10,000 residents were among nearly half a million people to flee the region after the disaster.
BBC Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says the vast majority of the town's original inhabitants are unlikely to go back. 
Only 367 people - around 3.5% of the town's original population - had registered as residents as of late March, local reports said.
Japanese authorities are hoping new infrastructure, including a town hall and state-owned housing, will attract residents to return.

Media captionIn 2016, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes visited properties in the village of Obori, north of Okuma
However radiation remains a major concern for residents, especially those with children.
A survey by Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun found just over half of residents in Fukushima Prefecture felt that progress has been made toward recovery. 
The 2011 Fukushima disaster saw three reactors of the nuclear power plant, some 62km (39 miles) south-east of the city of Fukushima, fail after it was damaged and flooded in the tsunami.
The accident forced more than 470,000 people to be evacuated because of nuclear contamination concerns.
Just under 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown.

 More than 18,000 people died or went missing in the tsunami
Though no-one died as a direct result of the nuclear meltdown, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has paid out compensation to some of those affected. 
More than 40 patients had to be evacuated from a hospital in the area and later died, while other deaths have been linked to the trauma suffered by those who lost their homes and loved ones.
In 2017, three former Tepco executives went on trial charged with professional negligence linked to the hospital evacuation.","Okuma, a town near the wrecked Fukushima power plant, has partially reopened.",2019-04-10T10:55:20Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fukushima nuclear disaster: Abandoned town allows first residents home,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47879768,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/131E4/production/_106380387_mediaitem106380386.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,disaster,1

People anxiously watched Twitter for any news, just as Trump would have wanted, considering he often runs his presidency like a reality TV show. But when the announcement came a little after 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday, it brought down the related page, which was hosted on the GOP's website. Most people were greeted with a 404 page, which seems very fitting. However, using a web archive, we were able to grab some screenshots of the awards, which called out the New York Times, CNN and Time among others. Fox News also reported the same list. The real kicker on the list is number 11. ""And last, but not least: 'RUSSIA COLLUSION!' Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people. THERE IS NO COLLUSION!"" the post reads. Image: SCREENSHOT GOP.COM Image: screenshot gop.com Image: SCREENSHOT GOP.COM What a shitshow. People were quick to poke fun at Trump’s failed attempt at a fake award show, some drawing comparisons to his presidency. 404 error is also essentially how republicans answer every question about anything that could make them look bad. “I don’t recall.” — (((𝕺𝖍𝕹𝖔𝕾𝖍𝖊𝕿𝖜𝖎𝖙𝖓𝖙))) (@OhNoSheTwitnt) January 18, 2018","President Donald Trump's Fake News Awards were, perhaps unsurprisingly, a complete and total disaster.

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — Adm. Karl L. Schultz was named the 26th commandant of the Coast Guard on Friday, taking over a military service that is in the midst of a fleet modernization as it juggles homeland security priorities like intercepting drugs and migrants and responding to disasters. President Trump attended Admiral Schultz’s change of command ceremony, held on the first day of the annual hurricane season. “I envision our heading remaining generally steady,” Admiral Schultz said. It was a compliment to his predecessor Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, who had directed the fleet modernizing effort and steered the first budget increase in years to the Coast Guard, the 227-year-old military branch that is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. Admiral Schultz had commanded the Coast Guard’s Atlantic area and last year oversaw the fleet’s response to Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey. The service rescued nearly 12,000 people along the East Coast and in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands during the deadly 2017 hurricane season.",Adm. Karl L.

Bijan Stephen,"Fyre Festival puppet master Billy McFarland isn’t going to prison, but he does owe the people he defrauded — via the beautiful, doomed disaster that was the one-percenter island music festival, and before that, the fake influencer credit card company Magnises — to the tune of $27.4 million. Following McFarland’s conviction on two counts of wire fraud by the US Attorney’s office earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission has settled with him and two of his lieutenants, Grant Margolin (his CMO) and Daniel Simon (an independent contractor), after alleging that the trio had fraudulently hoovered up money from more than 100 investors by misrepresenting themselves. The quote from the SEC’s latest press release is choice : McFarland induced investors to entrust him with tens of millions of dollars by fraudulently inflating key operational, financial metrics and successes of his companies, as well as his own personal success – including by giving investors a doctored brokerage account statement purporting to show personal stock holdings of over $2.5 million when, in reality, the account held shares worth under $1,500. Naturally, McFarland used the money he received to fund the lifestyle he’d always wanted — partying with celebs, private jets, etc. — as is the wont of the high-end scammer. “McFarland gained the trust of investors by falsely portraying himself as a skilled entrepreneur running a series of successful media companies,” said Melissa Hodgman, the associate director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, in another absolutely brutal quote. Image: Fyre Festival LLC McFarland, Margolin, and Simon were charged with “violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,” and the three have agreed to pay back the money they bilked. McFarland owes $27.4 million and has been permanently barred from serving as either an officer or a director of a public company; Margolin owes $35,000, and agreed to a 7-year ban; Simon owes a relatively reasonable $15,000, and has been banned for three years. (As the SEC deftly notes: this settlement is still subject to court approval.) It’s a fine ending to last year’s wild saga, which is remembered fondly by everyone who didn’t buy $12,000 tickets for McFarland’s “once-in-a-lifetime” concert in the Bahamas. But honestly, it could only have ended this way; any good deed that generates this much schadenfreude and embarrasses hundreds of wealthy socialites cannot go unpunished. (Jeffrey Atkins, aka Ja Rule, who promoted the festival alongside McFarland and co., has not been charged with anything.) Even if we won’t always have McFarland, we’ll always have Fyre Festival.

EMILY COCHRANE,"On Tuesday, Senate Democrats will propose an amendment to the House legislation that would allocate billions of dollars, in part for long-term recovery, to both Iowa and Nebraska as well as Puerto Rico, according to a Senate Democratic aide.
Earlier Monday, Mr. Trump had doubled down on his support for the Senate Republicans proposal, but made no mention of Puerto Rico a frequent target of his ire.
Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdues disaster relief bill, he wrote on Twitter, singling out Mr. Perdue, Republican of Georgia, who helped write the bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!
And in a closed-door lunch last week with Senate Republicans, the president complained about the cost of aid to the island, though it was unclear where he was getting his information from.

Rachel Becker,"Last week in the New Mexico desert, military and civilian bomb squads faced off at the 12th annual Robot Rodeo, which is a week of intense training organized by Sandia National Laboratories. To test their skills, bomb squads steered their bots to enter downed planes, explore faux-radioactive disaster sites, and climb flights of stairs. “Everybody else is running away from the bomb, and these guys are going in,” says Jake Deuel, robotics manager at Sandia and coordinator of the rodeo. His goal is for the event to help bomb squads tackle real-world situations and learn what their robots can and cannot do. “We train these guys to come home safe,” he says. Some of the crafted scenarios are designed to test the robot operators’ skills and problem-solving abilities. One exercise, for example, was based on the 1984 movie Red Dawn, where teenagers fight off invading forces in World War III. The competing robots had to go into a downed Phantom F-4 fighter jet to “retrieve the black box and some of the fancy electronics so that we can figure out what the enemy is doing,” Deuel says. Another exercise required bomb squads to work together to find the sources of an underground radiation leak and contain them. “It’s not just like driving around remote-controlled cars. It’s complicated. There are broken wings and sharp objects, challenging areas you’ve got to get the robot in,” Deuel says. That’s why this kind of training is so key. The scenarios are “about robot manipulation and control, wrapped around a fun little story.” The Verge spoke with Deuel about operating robots, alien blood collection, and why robot training is so important. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Walk me through what a Robot Rodeo looks like. I usually have 10 to 12 teams show up, which means I usually need 10 to 12 different scenarios. Think of a scenario as a vignette. They typically only get 90 minutes. In each scenario, there’s a script that one of my evaluators would read to them. The bomb techs might ask some questions like, “Are we looking for six or seven of these items?” The evaluator may answer that question. Typically they’ll say, “We have no more information. You’ve got 90 minutes. Begin!” And then they’ve got to start solving the problem. Photo: Sandia National Laboratories A robot explores an underground facility, searching for radiation at the 12th annual Robot Rodeo. Is it BYO-robot? Instead of bringing your own bottle, you bring your own bot to the event. I’ll probably get the saying wrong, but it’s “train as you fight, fight as you train.” If I gave them something else or something different, that’s not the best way to get training value. It’s got to be your equipment — you know what it does, you know what it doesn’t do. So they’ll actually show up in their bomb truck, and these scenarios are usually geographically based around Sandia labs, which is on Kirtland Air Force Base here in Albuquerque. And so I’ll have some scenarios spread out so that the teams aren’t all seeing each other. I’ve got to find a location or something that looks like a burned-out building or a village or an underground, so you have to find a location to hold a scenario. Video: Vince Gasparich/Sandia National Laboratories Did I hear correctly in the video from last year’s Robot Rodeo that you’ve done an alien blood-collection scenario? Is there something Sandia knows that the rest of us don’t? We like to build a scenario around the Men in Black movies. And when we did it, we had access to an old C-130 airplane fuselage. And so in that one, “Galaxy Air” — that’s the airline in the Men in Black movies — was transporting aliens, and these aliens were on life support. And we had a recirculating pump that you’d have in a party with a punch bowl pumping the liquid. So we had that set up with a bunch of red Kool-Aid representing the blood. One of the things they had to do was drive into the airplane fuselage, which was non-trivial getting up in there. They had a little plastic beaker that they had to pick up in their little robot gripper and not drop it and get it under this stream of dripping blood. But then they also had to take a sample of something else. And then it’s like, “Oh wait, I’ve already got this beaker full of blood in my gripper, and I’m supposed to do something else.” It’s like, “You know what, shoot. I should have done the other task first and then gone over and picked up the beaker.” So, it might seem funny — and it was — but it’s really also training them to think about your operational sequence and to think it through. Don’t just get excited and start driving inside the airplane. Video: Vince Gasparich/Sandia National Laboratories Why is it important for bomb techs to practice driving their robots? Driving your robot is a perishable skill — just like playing a sport or playing a video game. When you’re a kid and you’re playing a video game, it takes hours and hours of practice. But you put it down for weeks or a month, and then you try to pick it up again, and it’s like, “Okay, how do I do this? Where’s the switch? Is it this switch I flip up or flip down?” You’ve got to just keep practicing it, and the robot rodeo forces them to do that. We did a scenario years ago where the basic objective of that scenario was just operator skill. They drove the robot, picked up a frisbee off the ground, hung it on a coat rack, drove across these spare tires with a mouse trap in the gripper without dropping it, all that kind of stuff. Imagine in front of you that there are lots of knobs and switches that control all the various joints of the robot and how you drive, and a joystick you can move for the camera, and a different one to fire the weapons systems. So imagine all that, and we put a Tupperware box on top of it with two holes to stick your hands in so that you couldn’t see your hands. Oh boy, were they mad at me for that one. But at the end of it, they said, “That was a fantastic one because I realized I’ve got to get better at this.” Because in a real life-or-death situation, when they’re out there with that robot, you can’t be looking down at your hands. You have to have trained enough to just know instinctively where all the buttons or the knobs are so you’re focused on the task of disabling that device or rendering it safe or saving someone.

JAMES GLANZ and THOMAS KAPLAN,"A similar series of events involving faulty sensor data and an automated system suspected in bringing down a Boeing plane in Indonesia may have also caused the crash of the same type of jet in Ethiopia in March, according to people who have been briefed on the contents of the black box in Ethiopia.
Data from a vane-like device, called an angle-of-attack sensor, incorrectly activated the automatic, computer-controlled system, called MCAS, which pushed the nose of the plane down, eventually leading to a crash that killed all 157 people aboard.
The black box, also called the flight data recorder, contains information on dozens of systems aboard the plane. The black boxes on both planes, Boeings latest generation of the 737, survived the crashes, allowing investigators to begin piecing together what caused the disasters. Both investigations are ongoing and no final determinations have been made.
There are two angle-of-attack sensors on the Boeing 737 Max, one attached to the fuselage on the pilots side and another on the co-pilots side. Investigators in Indonesia, who have produced a preliminary report and released some of the information from the box, saw that one sensor produced a reading that was at least 20 degrees different from the other as the plane took off and began its ascent.","As in the Lion Air disaster, investigators believe an automated system on the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight was set off by erroneous readings.",2019-03-29T22:48:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Ethiopia Crash, Faulty Sensors on Boeing 737 Max Are Suspected",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/business/29boeing/29boeing-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
THOMAS KAPLAN,"Photo Damage from Hurricane Maria in Utuado, Puerto Rico, was still visible last week. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. Credit Alvin Baez/Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief from this year’s devastating hurricanes but urged lawmakers to make spending cuts to offset disaster costs that are now approaching $100 billion. The White House request for more disaster relief after the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, set up a possible confrontation over whether Congress must to find spending cuts to pay for relief even as President Trump pushes for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. White House officials suggested a raft of cuts to pay for the relief, including $730 million from the Army Corps of Engineers’ operations, maintenance, flood control and coastal emergencies funds, $196 million from the Department of Agriculture’s rural economic development program, and $72 million from the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The State Department’s Democracy Fund would lose $99 million and the Department of Transportation highway aid to states would lose $1 billion. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, immediately rebuked the White House over its requests to offset the funding. “Just one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement. “Holding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.” Republicans have been conspicuously quiet about their concerns over adding to the ballooning national debt. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

Rayne Ellis,"Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control. But as communities in places like Texas and Puerto Rico are learning, disaster relief that only alleviates physical wants is not enough to put their communities back on their feet. After first responders have done their jobs to secure personal safety, an emotional recovery has to begin as well. Organizations like UNICEF are acknowledging that the damage to communities can last long after the repairs to homes are completed. Canned goods and other basic need items are given out in a disaster relief station in southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images “When the reality of the disaster sets in, the emotional and psychological responses that are seen community-wide are tremendous and overwhelming,” Center for School Behavioral Health director Janet Pozmantier said. “People simply don’t have the wherewithal to cope effectively.” That's where organizations like UNICEF are stepping in. Called psychosocial disaster relief, this kind of help comes in the weeks and months after a disaster in order to help people recover emotionally. If UNICEF can help it, these recovery efforts will be implemented after every storm. Psychosocial relief in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and Harvey are currently ongoing, and UNICEF knows that the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas will also require this kind of help in the near future. Other organizations like the Red Cross have also been championing psychological first aid measures for years, and with good reason. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century Research suggests that those who have survived catastrophe tend to start showing signs of trauma roughly three months after the event took place. Those signs can look like anything from anxiety and depression to constant irritability and anger or even complete dissociation and inattention in both children and adults. In order to combat these symptoms, Pozmantier and other staff at the center working under Mental Health America in Greater Houston developed free workshops to teach others how to effectively help people struggling in the aftermath of traumatic disaster-related events. Damaged furniture and personal belongings sit on a flooded curb in Southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images The workshop focuses on helping educators identify signs and symptoms of trauma in children while also including other useful tools like mindfulness training and how to self-regulate emotions. After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, UNICEF reached out to the center and offered to fund a Harvey-specific trauma training workshop, which the center named Hope for Harvey. In the months after Harvey made landfall in Texas, Pozmantier would drive through neighborhoods and see the entire contents of homes in a pile on the curb — family photos and clothing laying on top of piles of water damaged furniture — all ready to be collected by waste management. She said it was easy to understand why people would be traumatized. So when the center developed Hope for Harvey, aside from training people to deal with trauma in children, they also added some training on how to deal with adults. “Going through something like this, I realized more than ever that if we can take care of the adults, the kids are going to be okay for the most part too,” Pozmantier said. Nine months later, when UNICEF approached the center again to help Puerto Rico recover, the message was the same. The center developed a workshop, completely in Spanish, to help curb the emotional impact Hurricane Maria had on the people of Puerto Rico, focusing again on children — but also providing help to adults. First, UNICEF sent hygiene kits, water, and helped with shelter. But what UNICEF President Caryl Stern said she’s most proud of is the collaborative work that UNICEF and the Center for School Behavioral Health were able to put into action. A man and a child stand in front of a destoryed house in Puerto Rico a few days after Hurricane Maria hit the island. Image: unicef usa “Now classrooms are catastrophe stations the every time it rains in Puerto Rico. The children are worried that their home is destroyed. Or they’re wondering 'Is my mother okay?'” Stern said. Even seeing adults in distress can trigger the children, Stern said. Once Stern experienced this, she said she know that the training workshops would be incredibly important. In addition to the workshops, UNICEF sent a few hundred college students from State University of New York and City University of New York to pair up with member of various Puerto Rican communities to help rebuild the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico. Through this, people were able to come together and repair their communities themselves — something that can have a strong positive effect on the psyche. Stern says everyone who has ever dealt with disaster relief knows that the psychosocial recovery is the most import aspect of relief that is widely ignored by the public. Pozmantier agreed, adding that if she could, she would mandate that all educators go through training in mental health, trauma, mindfulness, and self-help strategies. “They are the first line of defense. It’s like any other kind of illness. You wouldn’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to try and strengthen your immune system,” Pozmantier said.","Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control.

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a budget document released by a Democratic senator late Wednesday night, diverting funds from the relief agency just as a major hurricane barrels toward the East Coast. The document, which was released by the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, shows that the money would come from FEMA’s operations and support budget and was transferred into accounts at ICE to pay for detention and removal operations. The document also shows that the Department of Homeland Security transferred money from accounts at Customs and Border Protection that pays for border fencing and technology. Mr. Merkley, appearing Tuesday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, said the Trump administration was taking money from FEMA’S “response and recovery” and “working hard to find funds for additional detention camps.” Mr. Merkley has been a vocal critic of the administration’s immigration policies.

Frederic Lardinois,"With the rise of Kubernetes as the de facto standard for container orchestration, it’s no surprise that there’s now a whole ecosystem of companies springing up around this open source project. Heptio is one of the most interesting ones, in no small part due to the fact that it was founded by Kubernetes co-founders Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie. Today, Heptio announced that it is teaming up with Microsoft on its Heptio Ark project, which it launched earlier this year. Heptio Ark is a utility for managing backups and disaster recovery that helps you bring your Kubernetes clusters and volumes back up after your run into a major issue in your data center. The plan is for Microsoft and Heptio to work together on strengthening Ark’s core capabilities, but also on making it a tool for moving Kubernetes applications across on-premise environments and — unsurprisingly — Microsoft Azure and the Azure Container Service (AKS — because Microsoft hasn’t come around to renaming it to ‘Azure Kubernetes Service’ just yet). “Few real-world companies live solely in the public cloud,” said Heptio CEO Craig McLuckie. “It is incredibly important that the tools and practices they adopt when selecting their public cloud services work on-premises as well. Microsoft ’s commitment to working with the open source community will not only benefit Azure customers, but strengthens the Kubernetes community.” What’s also interesting about this move is that it brings the three Kubernetes co-founders together, with Beda and McLuckie at Heptio, and Microsoft’s Brendan Burns, who worked with the Heptio founders at Google when they launched the Kubernetes project into open source (and who was the lead engineer for Kubernetes at Google). “I’m excited to see Heptio and Microsoft deliver a compelling solution that satisfies an important and unmet need in the Kubernetes ecosystem,” said Burns. “We’re working with Heptio to ensure that the integration of Ark and Azure is a best-of-breed solution for backing up on-premise Kubernetes clusters into the cloud.” Featured Image: alzay/Getty Images","With the rise of Kubernetes as the de facto standard for container orchestration, it’s no surprise that there’s now a whole ecosystem of companies springing up around this open source project.

Ron Miller,"Remember how VMware was supposed to be disrupted by AWS? Somewhere along the way it made a smart move. Instead of fighting the popular cloud platform, it decided to make it easier for IT to use its products on AWS. Today, at the opening of the AWS re:invent customer conference, it announced plans to expand that partnership with some new migration and disaster recovery services. As Mark Lohmeyer, VP of the VMware cloud platform business unit pointed out, it’s only been a quarter since they made the original product generally available. The new products are designed to help ease the transition to the cloud. One of the issues VWmare customers have struggled with, is simply moving their mission critical applications from their datacenters to the cloud. Lohmeyer says the new migration product is designed to move applications quickly with no down time and for a reasonable cost (although that’s probably in the eye of the beholder). If it works as advertised, it really gives IT the best of both worlds. They can move their applications lock, stock and barrel from the datacenter to AWS and continue to monitor and manage them in the way they have been. If there truly is no downtime, this makes for an easy cloud transition, whether a company wants to start slowly and move an application or two or has plans to shut down the company datacenter and needs to move everything. What’s more, VMware is sweetening the pot by offering reserved pricing discounts over the traditional hourly pricing model. That means if you sign up for a year or three years you get a discount, although the amount will vary depending on volume and other factors. They are also introducing hybrid licenses, which allow customers to continue to use their on-prem licenses when they move to the cloud. All of these factors could reduce the overall cost of transitioning to the cloud over standard pricing approaches. VMware also announced a new disaster recover product. This enables IT to keep a copy of applications and data in the cloud on AWS. In the event of a disaster like a massive hurricane, power outage or other misfortune they can keep going with minimal disruption. “If you have a failure in your on-prem cloud, you can organize a restart on AWS,” Lohmeyer explained. The disaster recovery tool also helps those companies that may be slow to move to the cloud to get more comfortable with the idea. If you can store your disaster recovery backup in the cloud, you may be ready to move the actual applications at some point too. VMware was the company that popularized the virtual machine concept and today it is the premiere datacenter product. The problem for VMware has been that the future is moving out of the datacenter and into the cloud. Its first idea was to try to build its own public cloud service and compete with AWS. When that idea fizzled, VMware had a Plan B and that was to partner with the other cloud vendors. The biggest of those is of course AWS. As Lohmeyer sees it, this partnership is good for everyone. “It’s good for customers because they can readily take advantage of the cloud model. It’s good for VMware because we are keeping the customers on our platforms and growing the workloads. And it’s good for AWS because there are more workloads running on their platform.” If it works as described, that’s the ingredients for an ideal partnership.","Remember how VMware was supposed to be disrupted by AWS?

KENNETH R. ROSEN,"“You should have a general evacuation plan as well as a communication plan. You should sit down with your family and discuss,” said Mr. Booher, the FEMA spokesman, “but also share with your friends and colleagues in case something was to happen — someone outside your immediate family would be able to track you down.” Here are some items to keep on you or at the ready in your home or office, in addition to the basics. A Multi-Tool: “I have one I bring climbing, one I bring camping/hiking and one for rafting/SUPing,” Mr. Egensteiner said, referring to stand-up paddling. “They can do everything, and the list of tools packed into the big ones today is staggering.” These tools, like The Wirecutter’s favorite, the Leatherman New Wave, can also help with performing first-aid, making fires and repairing machinery or electronics. The best come with everything from a sharp knife and pair of pliers or tweezers to a can opener. Spare Clothing: Consider your climate and pack for the most common weather. From an extra coat and gloves to a pair of walking shoes, consider the three basic layers for weatherproofing: base, insulation and shell. The base layer should include something that wicks away moisture and maintains body temperature such as synthetics or merino wool. Insulation layers can include puffy jackets stuffed with wool or down, or a fleece hooded sweatshirt or vest. The shell layer should be wind- and rain-resistant, but also breathable. A Weather/Emergency Radio: Wirecutter suggested the Midland ER310, “an emergency radio that can tune in to AM/FM and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration channel.” In the event of an emergency, especially a weather-related emergency, radio is your best bet to get up-to-date information on weather patterns, evacuation orders or official news from the authorities. A portable, easily powered radio like this one can keep you connected to the outside world even if you’re stuck in a cellar, or a shelter. This one can be powered by battery, hand crank, solar energy or USB. If you’re packing for a family, including children, build off the basics and necessities for one person, and make sure you pack enough supplies for everyone. Here are some more items to include if you’re considering more people. Mylar Blankets: Full sleeping bags are too cumbersome for an emergency kit, so these are a lighter alternative. “Mylar thermal blankets or bags are windproof, waterproof and capable of reflecting more than 90 percent of your body heat,” Mr. Paul, of The Wirecutter, said. “Inexpensive and easy to store, this should be the minimum you carry for warmth.”",It is never too early to talk with friends and family about emergency plans — and how to build the perfect go-bag in case disaster strikes.,2018-09-11T20:53:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How to Pack an Emergency Kit for Any Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/smarter-living/packing-emergency-kit-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/13/us/03bugout/03bugout-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
Jon Russell,"Sad news for anyone into giant robots: Google is closing down Schaft, its secretive unit that develops bipedal robots aimed at helping out in disaster efforts and generally looking badass. The news was first reported by Nikkei, but Google confirmed to TechCrunch that the business will be shuttered. It said it is helping staff find new roles, most of which will likely be outside of Google and its Alphabet parent. Firstly up, many people — myself included — might have forgotten that Google owns Schaft. The company was scheduled to be sold to SoftBank alongside Boston Dynamics — another of Google’s robotics ventures — through a deal that was announced last year. Boston Dynamics made the transition but Schaft didn’t. Softbank never shouted that omission from the rooftops, but a source with knowledge of the deal told us that certain conditions agreed for the deal were not fulfilled, hence Schaft remained with Google. Our source explained that Google’s robotics focused shifted away from Schaft and instead to non-humanoid robots and industry-led solutions such as robotic arms. The departure of Andy Rubin, the controversial robotics evangelist who reportedly got a $90 million payout to leave amid sexual misconduct allegations, seemed to speed up its demise inside the organization. Google shopped the Schaft business fairly widely — since 2016 and after the SoftBank deal collapsed — but to no avail, we understand. That left closing it down as the last remaining option. Schaft was founded in 2012 by a group led by University of Tokyo professor Yuto Nakanishi. Alphabet acquired Shaft and Boston Dynamics in 2013, the former was part of a group of seven acquisitions, in undisclosed deals. There’s been plenty of attention on Boston Dynamics and its crazy, even scary, robots which can trek across all terrains and get up instantly when knocked over, but Schaft maintained a fairly quiet presence. Indeed, its first major prototypes weren’t revealed until some two years after its acquisition.","Sad news for anyone into giant robots: Google is closing down Schaft, its secretive unit that develops bipedal robots aimed at helping out in disaster efforts and generally looking badass.

Jordan Crook,"Last weekend, Epic Games put forth its first true effort at official competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. It was a disaster. The private hosts used for the tournament were about as laggy as could be, with pro players getting eliminated simply because they couldn’t move. This tournament was for a total prize of $250K. That’s big money, and big frustration for pro players who were essentially eliminated by the whims of the server gods. But on top of the lag, the whole thing was, well, boring. A cardinal sin in any sport. The fact is that when you put 100 pro players in a lobby together and tell them that the last man standing wins, most of them will simply sit in a fort and stay safe as long as possible. This does not generate a whole lot of action. And when there is action on the map, there was no way for a spectator to know about it. There are, after all, a hundred people to watch out for, and jumping from one engagement to another is not only difficult but lacks a certain narrative quality, making the whole thing feel scattered. It seems clear that a guided mode or hotspot indicator would go a long way to improving the viewing experience. Being told where the fighting was or could be happening or having a guide that flagged these opportunities could work. There could also be a documentary-style concept that followed a few top players on their entire run, with the hope that they’ll find action and maybe even be pushed into conflict to impress viewers. Epic recently published a post-mortem on the event, outlining ways that the publisher can improve on the tournament. They’ve also set forth the rules for this weekend’s event, proposing a score-based tournament where both eliminations and Victory Royales count toward players’ overall score. Whether or not this will incentivize more action will be determined following the event. It’s also worth noting that Epic scheduled today’s event during the Fortnite Friday tournament. Fortnite Friday, hosted by popular YouTuber Keemstar and facilitated by UMG, was a $20,000 elimination-based tournament with top players. In this week of the Summer Skirmish Series, worth $1 million, Epic is choosing to host a two-day tournament, effectively rendering Fortnite Friday playerless. It doesn’t have to be this way, Epic. I know that the concept of 100 of the best players in the world dropping into one map sounds incredible. It does. It sounds great, in theory. But in practice, it’s just a disorderly live stream of a bunch of highly talented players sitting around in bases, or worse lagging to the point of being frozen. And, an invitational tournament (that goes terribly wrong) doesn’t scream “inclusive,” which is what Epic repeatedly says competitive Fortnite should be. There is another way, and it’s the same way that Fortnite players have been competing for months now. A kill race. But let’s back up a bit. Right now, Fortnite is played by 100 people in a single lobby, and ‘winning’ the game is defined by being the last survivor(s). This can be played in solo mode, with 100 individuals facing off against the storm and each other, or in 50 teams of two (Duos), or 25 teams of 4 (Squads). Videogames often get tweaks for the competitive scene, whether it’s limiting the resources/gear that players can use or reducing the number of maps that can be played. When skill level is that high, most games must make changes to allow for true competition. Given it’s still early days, Fortnite Battle Royale featuring purely pro players simply hasn’t worked. But as it stands now, there are roughly two schools of thought. Whoever gets the most eliminations wins. Pros: Super fun to watch Requires skill Inclusive to non-pro players Cons: A lot of RNG More time consuming Gamebattle sites like CMG and UMG have been running minor tournaments for quite a while now using this format. Fortnite Friday, arguably one of the biggest weekly tournaments, also follows this format. Here’s how it works: Individual players load up in a Duo match on the same team, or teams of two load up into a Squad match, also on the same team, and race for who can get the most kills in a public match. This means that these opposing players can’t kill each other, but can keep track of each other’s kills and placement on the map. When you’re racing for kills, understanding where the other duo are fighting and how many kills they have is important information. Given only four players are competing at a time, that means that the rest of the 92 people on the map are regular Fortnite players. This is where RNG comes into play. RNG is a term used in gaming that means Random Number Generator. It is the gaming equivalent of Alanis Morsette’s “Ironic.” It essentially means that there is some level of random luck involved in the game. For example, you might land in a place where there is usually a weapon or chest, but that weapon or chest isn’t there, leaving you vulnerable to other players who land around you. Great players can work around or overcome a certain level of RNG, but if the opposing team comes up on a squad of noobs and your team rolls up on a squad of great players, the tide of the match will inevitably shift against you, and may even result in a loss. This is the cost of the 2v2 format that has become popularized with the vast majority of Fortnite competitive players. While it takes more time to have 100 players compete four at a time, this format allows the viewer to watch no more than four players as they traverse the map and seek eliminations. At most, the audience has to follow along with four separate stories on the map. In most cases, duos play together which brings that number down to two. In either case, it’s much easier than following along with the stories of 50 separate teams. Traditional Battle Royale Pros: Less RNG Amazing build fights Fair, in the sense that players are fighting players of equal skill level Cons: It’s boring Not inclusive Confusing and scattered for viewers This format was used during the Ninja Live tournament, the Fortnite ProAm tournament, and most recently during the $8 million Summer Skirmish series, hosted by Epic Games. Here’s how it works: 100 pro players/streamers pair off into teams of two and all load into the same lobby, with the goal of lasting the longest. As I said, Fortnite Battle Royale is built around the idea that there would be a sole survivor, but doesn’t predicate that survival on a certain level of skill. In other words, it’s relatively easy to hide, avoid fights, and survive to the near end of a game, or potentially even win. It doesn’t take much skill to squat in a bush or set traps in a house and sit in the bathroom. Obviously, with pro players, there will be gunfights, and those gunfights should be pretty interesting. But they are few and far between, and are difficult to predict and capture for the live stream. This also excludes regular players from being a part of the action. Yes, it’s a risk to construct a competitive scene on the backs of public game play. But it’s also never been done before in the pro gaming world. And it is the best way to include public players into the competitive scene. A regular player is far more likely to get interested in the competitive scene knowing that, on Friday or Saturday, they have the chance to play against the world’s greatest competitors. The best way to build on the momentum of Fortnite’s popularity, as well as support the community as a whole, is to build out tournaments focused on eliminations within public lobbies. It makes sense for Epic to want to control that experience, and it certainly makes sense for Epic to want the competitive scene to fit within the game they built, which is a Battle Royale. But thus far, competitive Battle Royale featuring purely pro players simply hasn’t worked. And it feels slightly underhanded for Epic to barrel over Fortnite Friday, given that the more competitive tournaments around Fortnite, the better for the game. The community is here, telling you what it wants, Epic. And in true Fortnite fashion, if you build it, they will come.","Last weekend, Epic Games put forth its first true effort at official competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. It was a disaster.

Jane Merrick,"Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low. The British Prime Minister wanted to show her Conservative Party -- and the country -- that there is more to her government than the tortuous Brexit negotations, with some optimism about the future. Instead, she far exceeded their expectations, delighting members of Parliament and activists from the first minute: the normally rigid, awkward Prime Minister came onto the conference stage to ABBA's ""Dancing Queen, "" breaking out some moves as she approached the lectern. The idea to open her speech this way -- making light of her stilted dances during a trip to South Africa in August -- was all hers. Widely mocked for being robotic in persona and intransigent in policy, May decided to take ownership, self-deprecatingly, of her flaws. But it was also her opportunity to show the Conservative Party -- including her arch-critic Boris Johnson -- that she is still in charge of the Brexit process and has authority over her government. It was a tough ask. Privately, her allies had been just hoping she would make it to the end of the speech, and the end of the four-day conference in Birmingham, without mishap -- which last year included a persistent cough, the set behind her falling apart and a stage invasion by someone handing her the British equivalent of a pink slip. It was that last incident that seemed, at the time, the most portentous -- foreshadowing her resignation over Brexit. Yet that resignation never came. That is not to say the last year has been an easy one for May. It has been a turbulent 12 months, bookended by these two pivotal speeches. Of course, May did not resign, but seven of her Cabinet ministers walked out, for various reasons. Two of those resignations were potentially the most damaging, because they were in direct opposition to her so-called Chequers plan for withdrawal from the EU: Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and David Davis as Brexit secretary. The work of her government has seemed stymied by Brexit. Negotiations with Brussels have been slow and difficult, forcing the PM to take personal charge of the talks this summer. Last month, she took her Chequers plan to a summit in Salzburg where it was rebuffed by fellow EU leaders. Though this was a serious blow to her credibility, the next day May came out fighting, demanding respect from the EU. This lack of support has been much closer to home, too. Since his resignation in July, Johnson has engaged in regular attacks against the Prime Minister over Brexit, most recently in a packed-out event at the conference on Tuesday, when his call to ""chuck Chequers"" was cheered by pro-Brexit Tory activists. Yet despite rapturous applause for the former Foreign secretary, many of his fellow Conservative MPs saw this attempt to overshadow the PM as an act of disloyalty. Similarly, a Tory MP who lodged a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, minutes before May was due on stage, was dismissed by his colleagues as ill-timed and disloyal. The Prime Minister had two main messages: one for her party and one for the country. On the first, she made clear she would not change tack on Chequers, despite escalating calls from Brexiteer Tory MPs, and from remain supporters who want a second referendum. The result of the 2016 EU referendum must be honored and she would not shift on the issue of breaking up the United Kingdom -- something that would be under threat if the alternative plan floated by Johnson and other Brexiteers were agreed. On the second, she tried to pitch to the center ground, appealing to voters who are disaffected by the opposition Labour leader's hard left-wing, anti-business policies. She pledged the Tories would be a ""party for the whole country"" that was ""decent, moderate and patriotic."" Her performance was strong enough to see off her critics inside the Conservative Party -- for now. Yet in a week's time, the next round of Brexit negotiations between the UK and Brussels takes place at which there is supposed to be significant progress made towards a deal. During her party conference, which was being watched closely by EU chiefs back in Brussels, there were reports that the UK might agree to stay in the customs union beyond the end of the Brexit transition phase at the end of 2020. If that is on the cards, May did not make mention of it in her speech -- presumably to keep her party inside the hall onside. Yet the UK will need to make concessions to break the deadlock on Brexit next week. The Prime Minister has survived her toughest year so far -- but an even tougher one lies ahead.","Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low.",2018-10-03T12:48:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' to the rescue,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/opinions/theresa-mays-year-jane-merrick-opinion-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181003080715-theresa-may-8-3-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,disaster,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone. After a tsunami battered the island late last week, leaving at least 1,350 dead, a volcano has now erupted. Earlier this week, scientists forecast that Soputan, an active stratovolcano on the northeastern tip of the island, was showing signs of activity. On Wednesday, it sent an ash cloud towering nearly 20,000 feet above its summit. By night, lava was trickling down Soputans flanks. The volcano continues to be on a Level III alert, which is a watch and take precautions kind of alert, but not an evacuations are imminent one. Soputan has erupted a dozen times since 2000, so this isnt wholly a surprise. But it coming right after an earthquake that triggered a tsunami has people wondering if the geological phenomena are intertwined. The short answer: We dont know, but it seems unlikely. It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen, Kasbani, the head of Indonesias Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency who goes by only one name, said according to NBC News. Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti threw even more cold water on the speculation. Soputan had already been restless for months before the earthquake and the volcano is hundreds of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake, he said in an email to Earther. So, I invoke correlation =/= causation on this front. Indonesia is just that geologically active. Indeed, Indonesia is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world. The islands that make up the nation are home to dozens of active volcanoes owing to its proximity the edge of tectonic plates. That can allow magma to seep up from deep in the Earth to the surface more readily. This isnt the first eruption weve seen in Indonesia recently. In February, Mount Sinabung in Sumatra popped off, sending an extremely ominous-looking ash cloud towering over the countryside. Last November, Mount Agung on Bali did its thing, too.

He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocking escape routes. Mr Kammenos was confronted by angry locals as he visited areas devastated by fires east of Athens this week. At least 81 people died and search teams fear they will find further victims as dozens more are missing. Arriving in the fire zone in the town of Mati on Thursday, Mr Kammenos was surrounded by residents who accused him of abandoning them. ""You left us alone,"" one person told the minister, who was accompanied by the local mayor and the head of the air force. One man told the BBC he had reached the fire station to ask for help, and found firefighters unaware of the blaze. Another resident complained that people had been advised to dive into the sea to escape, when most of the elderly were unable to reach the sea in the first place. Many of the survivors were saved by the sea, but a large number of the victims in Mati were trapped close to a cliff-edge, unable to reach the water. Mr Kammenos, a combative figure who leads the nationalist Independent Greeks, rejected accusations that the government had failed to protect its citizens.

Jonathan Shieber,"If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do nothing more to respond to the climate change threat) the planet will warm by 7 degrees by the end of the century. It means, as one Twitter commentator pointed out, that climate change is not only real, but catastrophic… and the response is to burn more carbon because we’re all dead anyway. Well, at least they finally admitted it was real, said the man crawling out of the ensuing permanent desert hellstorm covering America into the more soothing environs of a 30 meter sea rise to quietly drown along with civilization as we know it… https://t.co/TwJ5nDwjtV — Matthew Ocko (@mattocko) September 28, 2018 If global temperatures rise 7 degrees, much of coastal America will find itself underwater. Ocean acidification will dissolve coral reefs and the world can expect dramatically more powerful and more damaging storms and more severe droughts and heatwaves. However, as The Washington Post reported, the dire assessment of the world’s climate situation wasn’t made with an eye toward trying to find solutions to the problem, merely to illustrate that the planet is already doomed. The revelations of our planet’s fate came buried in a 500-page report from the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration study that was meant to justify President Trump’s decision to drop fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks built after 2020. The administration’s argument is: if no one does anything more to combat climate change, then the world will be destroyed anyway, so there’s no point in doing anything to try and combat climate change. The (lack of) logic explains why the administration has rolled back emissions reduction requirements on methane (from oil and gas drilling and industrial animal farming), carbon dioxide (for coal fired power plants), and hydrofluorocarbons (used in refrigerators and air conditioners). The NTHSA report projects that global temperatures will rise by roughly 3.5 degrees above the last average temperature before climate change began to affect (the years between 1986 and 2005) whether or not the rules on fuel efficiency standards are enacted or not. The administration isn’t wrong in its assessment of where things stand now, but it is wrong in assuming that the current situation in any way reflects future realities. As the analysis states, the world will have to drastically slash carbon to avoid the kind of disastrous warming scenario. However, the assumption that the analysis reaches (as quoted by The Post ), that reducing emissions “would require substantial increases in technology innovation and adoption compared to today’s levels and would require the economy and the vehicle fleet to move away from the use of fossil fuels, which is not currently technologically feasible or economically feasible,” seems misplaced. It also flies in the face of repeated assertions by the President that climate change is a hoax. By acknowledging the existence of climate change and saying that nothing can be done to stop it, the new report provides a cover for all of the steps that have been taken by conservative lawmakers and the President’s cabinet to cut costs for industry. Meanwhile, the Carolinas are still underwater from flooding brought on by Hurricane Florence ( here are ways to donate ), and the risk of wildfires continues to increase in the West. This is fine.","If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do …",2018-09-28T18:39:21Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","As its own reports reveal the disaster of climate inaction, Trump proposes climate inaction",http://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/as-its-own-reports-reveal-the-disaster-of-climate-inaction-trump-proposes-climate-inaction/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,disaster,1
RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Ms. Mahoney, 25, was eight months pregnant when Irma ripped away their doors and windows, allowing the blast of rain into their old apartment. It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again. They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.” Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak. Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19. The baby’s arrival helped persuade the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.” But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away. With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs. She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects. “It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” she said. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.” _____ Continue reading the main story","More than two months after the disaster on the U.S. Virgin Islands began, we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms hit.",2017-11-10T10:00:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",After Irma and Maria: How 3 Spots on the U.S. Virgin Islands Are Faring,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/virgin-islands-hurricanes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/00USVI-top2/00USVI-top2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","France has turned into a bubbling cauldron of unrest over the past month as the so-called yellow vest movement has put up roadblocks and taken to the streets to protest a gas tax. Last weeks protests turned violent and facing a crisis, the government of Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday it would put a six-month moratorium on the tax. The tax was meant to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. While it likely wouldve done that, it wouldve done so on the backs of Frances rural low and middle class. The mass revolt against it doesnt mean those groups oppose climate action. It means that Macron needs to include them in discussions about the best way to address climate change as part of a just transition, something the world at-large is grappling with as it aims to get a handle on carbon emissions. More than 280,000 protesters donned yellow safety vests that motorists are required to keep in their cars and took to the streets across France last weekend. The protests have arisen organically through Facebook and other social media platforms, and span the ideological divide. Their focus has largely been on the unfairness of Macrons proposed gas tax, which wouldve raised prices by 0.029 per liter ($0.12 a gallon) on unleaded gas and 0.065 per liter ($0.24 a gallon) on diesel. Rising oil prices have pushed fuel prices higher still now was among the worst times to propose such a tax. The French government has spent years promoting diesel, and the tax wouldve left many already struggling to make ends meet with higher fuel bills on vehicles theyve been encouraged to buy. The money it raised would also have been used to combat the national deficit, which has been made worse in part by the Macron governments policies, like lifting portions of a wealth tax. In short, the gas tax was a technocratic fix without any real constituency and the benefits were poorly explained, leaving it open to criticism and protest. The yellow vests enjoy a broad base of support with a recent poll showing that 72 percent of the French public is sympathetic to the cause. California just became the first state in the U.S. to require all new buildings feature solar Read more Read The fight against the tax is not a fight against climate policy, however. We are not against the ecology, on the contrary, Benoit Julou, a spokesperson for the yellow vest movement, said on a France 3 talk show last week. Rather it shows that any policies that only consider climate benefits and are made top-down are destined to fail. Governments need to communicate clearly why change in all sectors of the economy is necessary to limit global warming and how it plans to buffer potentially negative social and economic implications, Alexander Reitzenstein, a policy advisor at the European think tank Third Generation Environmentalism, told Earther. The French government did not provide a credible plan for how to compensate particularly poorer households. Poor households are often most affected by higher fuel prices, higher electricity bills or higher costs for keeping homes warm. Reitzenstein is part of a growing group of researchers, policymakers, and advocates pushing for a just transition when it comes to climate change. Simply put, this is a way to ensure people working in the fossil fuel industry or other industries dependent on fossil fuels, as well as low income and disadvantaged communities in general, arent left holding the bag as the world tries to get a handle on carbon emissions. A just transition ensures that we create a world people want to live in and that everyones needs are accounted for. Spain recently offered a buyout for coal miners as it plans to shut down the industry by the end of the year. A just transition is also a central tenet of the Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And its a theme of this years climate talks in Poland. Reitzenstein, who is at the talks, said that the French protests have been a hot topic among the conference halls and meeting rooms as delegates grapple with the need to address climate change in the most equitable way possible. Ivetta Gerasimchuk, a researcher at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, pointed to policies in Indonesia that ended motor fuel subsidies in 2015 as an effective example of what transportation policy could look like. President Joko Widodo included subsidy reform in his election campaign explaining all the benefits that these budgetary savings can unlock, she told Earther while noting it came at a time of low fuel prices. Through this reform, Indonesia saved $15.6 billion and invested in budget increases for key areas including transport and other infrastructure and transfers to village. That illustrates some of the key principles Gerasimchuk said are part of just climate policies, including clearly communicating the benefits, engaging with communities, and building broad support. Macron could look at that as one avenue to build a new gas tax, but ultimately his government really needs to listen to the people in the streets. And those voices are speaking more loudly about the broader structural issues in France, many of which are found throughout the developed world associated with neoliberal policies that have driven inequality to some of the highest levels in modern history. The rising inequality also means the richest 10 percent of the world emit 50 percent of its carbon pollution, shining a potential glaring spotlight on who should pay the most to address climate change. Just transition and ambitious climate policy are two sides of the same coin, there is no choice to either do just transition or climate ambition, Reitzenstein said.","France has turned into a bubbling cauldron of unrest over the past month as the so-called yellow vest movement has put up roadblocks and taken to the streets to protest a gas tax.

KATIE ROGERS,"“Reagan’s experience with various statewide and national campaigns will be a big asset as the first lady and her team prepare to roll out her official platform in the coming months,” Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, said in an email. Mrs. Trump has given few clues to where she may focus her efforts, but she has publicly expressed interest in helping children affected by the opioid crisis, advocating anti-bullying measures and aiding disaster relief efforts. (The first lady’s previous promise to combat cyberbullying seems to have fallen on the list of priorities.) First ladies have often taken a deliberate approach to rolling out initiatives. Michelle Obama unveiled “Let’s Move,” her signature campaign to combat child obesity, about a year into her tenure. Laura Bush took about that much time organizing the first National Book Festival. Compared with her predecessors, Mrs. Trump is still keeping her East Wing staff small: At 12 people, the head count is roughly less than half the number of people who worked for previous first ladies. In addition to Ms. Thompson, the other new East Wing aides are Annie LeHardy, who will move from the West Wing to serve as a communications coordinator for Mrs. Trump, and Justin Caporale, a veteran of the Trump campaign and an aide in the White House advance office, who will serve as the first lady’s director of operations. As a student at Stanford University, Ms. Thompson served as the president of a student group supporting Mitt Romney’s run for president in 2012. During her time with Mr. Pompeo, she appears to have worked closely with him, including during his preparations to become C.I.A. director. “Proud of my friend &amp; colleague,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, wrote on Twitter last January, “who helped her boss @repmikepompeo get confirmed for CIA.” In winning a “30 Under 30” award from the website Red Alert Politics in 2016, Ms. Thompson told the site that “our party has to dig deep and recommit to our founding principles.” “I feel that time is short — we no longer have the option to just get along, to be popular, and take the easy way out,” she added. The announcement of Mrs. Trump’s staff additions comes days after the White House was put on the defensive by the new book, “Fire and Fury,” by Michael Wolff, which described President Trump as someone with a short attention span, lack of grasp of policy details and slapdash approach to the presidency. In the book, Mr. Wolff wrote that the first lady had cried on election night — a claim that two people close to her have denied — and had not supported Mr. Trump’s bid for the presidency. Mr. Trump’s response to the book has been decidedly more pugilistic than his wife’s, but, according to people who know her well, she shares the president’s grievances about the book and has instructed her staff to forcefully push back against it. “Mrs. Trump has always been supportive of her husband’s run for president and that continues a year into his presidency,” Ms. Grisham wrote in an email shortly after excerpts from the book were published last week. “She knows how much he loves this country and supports him fully. He consistently seeks her advice and counsel on many subjects.” Ms. Grisham did not go into specifics.

Natasha Lomas,"Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday. What’s it for? The idea is to enable the president of the United States to warn the nation of major threats — such as a natural disaster or terrorist attack. FEMA did already have the power to mass text US phones, via the National Wireless Emergency Alert System devised by the Bush administration in 2006, which has been used for sending alerts about national emergencies like weather events or missing children at a local level. But now the system has been expanded to allow for the White House to compose and send its own ‘presidential alert’ to all phones in a national emergency situation. There is no opt-out. Repeat: No opt-out. Fortunately Congress did limit the substance of these alerts — to “natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters or threats to public safety”, further stipulating that: Except to the extent necessary for testing the public alert and warning system, the public alert and warning system shall not be used to transmit a message that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety. But bearing in mind the ‘rip it up’ record of the current holder of office of the president of the US, there are no copper-bottomed guarantees about how ‘threat to public safety’ might be interpreted by president Trump. So it remains a slightly mind-bending concept that the president could, say after a 3am binge-watch of his favorite TV show, fire out an alert entirely of his framing to EVERY US PHONE. Technology is indeed a double-edged sword. Here are a few ideas of presidential alerts we really hope Trump won’t be sending… an accidental photo of a body part after he couldn’t figure out how to use the system and hit send accidentally a text message intended for his son-in-law “Donald Trump” covfefe an even worse spelling mistake, e.g. mangling the name of another world leader — like French president “Manuel Macaroon” actual insults directed at other world leaders, e.g. suggesting Emmanuel Macron has a dandruff problem threats of thermonuclear war an unfortunate spoonerism, e.g. ‘the rockets are cot numbing’ a love sonnet to president Kim Jong-Un encouragement to Russia to hack political opponents’ emails a recipe for a “beautiful” chocolate cake his golf handicap an affiliate link to a brochure of Trump Tower US stock market numbers investment advice an affiliate link to buy The Art of The Deal any other book recommendations at all a love sonnet to Ivanka Trump a claim that the hurricane isn’t actually as bad as FEMA’s alert says it is #MAGA “Lock her up” “His testimony was very credible, very credible” “You also had some very fine people on both sides” any claim about the size of the crowds at his inauguration any claim about historical precedence and what his administration has achieved all forms of self congratulation his thoughts on the UN his thoughts on NATO his thoughts on the EU his thoughts on China his thoughts on the Queen anything at all about women “Melanie” all insults about “the failing New York Times” a heart emoji + the words “Tucker Carlson” any text that includes the words “Fox &amp; Friends” any text that includes the phrase “America first” a photo of Melania reclining on gilt furniture, in a gilt room, with some gilt statues a selfie with anyone, especially Nigel Farage any text written in ALL CAPS any text ending with the word “Sad!” his travel itinerary for his next trip to the Winter White House a love sonnet to president Putin ‘exciting’ real estate opportunities credit for Brexit a threat to Twitter not to shadowban conservative voices “You’re fired!” “Build the wall!” “Mission accomplished!” anything at all about president Obama all sports commentary anything containing the word “winning” his thoughts on climate change his thoughts on environmental protection his thoughts on the safety of radioactive substances a list of reasons why the Iran deal was a mistake his thoughts on anything at all to do with the rest of the world a photoshopped picture of Justin Trudeau to make him look ugly diet advice travel advice fashion advice complaints that Google is biased anything about tax — unless it’s his own tax returns a message to Peter Thiel asking him to come back a message asking where the nearest KFC is a message asking where he left his last bucket of KFC a really boring and slightly blurred photo of the inside of Air Force One any message about anything at all he saw on TV last night “Ha-ha you can’t opt out!” “Genius” his thoughts","Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday.

From September until the fire began in early November, rainfall was five inches below normal. But welcome relief is en route. Major weather models show a series of storms, including an atmospheric river event, will usher in rain and snow to Northern California. The first blast of precipitation could come as early as Tuesday night, but the real rainmaker is expected to arrive on Thanksgiving and last through the weekend in the form of an atmospheric river. Tapping moisture from the tropics, its likely to send copious amounts of rain and mountain snow to the area around Paradise, the town basically wiped out by the Camp Fire, as well as points further north into Oregon. In fact, Oregon is likely to get whacked with the brunt of the storm, but the National Weather Service is still calling it a potential high impact event across Northern California. Up to 6 inches of rain could fall near Paradise and the surrounding area. That would tamp down flames, allowing firefighters to get an even better handle on containing the Camp Fire. The storm will also come with gusty winds, which should blow smoke out of not just the Paradise area but all of Northern California. That will be a welcome relief for people hundreds of miles from the fire who have been choking on smoke. The rain also comes with downsides, though. Debris flows are among the high impacts that the National Weather Service is forecasting. That could hamper the search and rescue operations that are still ongoing with more than 1,000 people missing and thousands of homes being assessed for damage. A Cal Fire spokesperson told Earther it could clog roads, impeding firefighters access to where they need to dig fire lines and assess damage. It could also wash away bone fragments and other signs of victims who were essentially cremated by the Camp Fire. Because of that and the already tall task of sifting through ash for signs of human remains, the Butte County sheriff said its possible well never know the full toll of the fire. Theres also the concern for the thousands of people who are homeless. An impromptu tent city popped up in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Chico, about 15 miles to the west of Paradise. The rain could swamp the encampment, and organizers are rushing to get people settled into sheltered with roofs that are more solid than tarps and rain flies, according to CNN. A number of shelters have reported outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug that can cause vomiting and diarrhea. The whole situation may sound like something more familiar in the developing world than the richest nation on the planet, but here we are. It makes clear how the effects of climate change, which has worsened wildfire season, can cascade to create a disaster on top of a disaster. This is a dress rehearsal for the future, one which no amount of raking the forest can stop.","In what may be the first bit of good news in a while for Northern California, rain could be on the way by the end of this week.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and DAVID ZUCCHINO","Around lunchtime, Steven Swank, 23, was packing a few cases of water into a little sedan. In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

Aimée Lutkin,"Hurricane Florence has hit the North Carolina coast, already causing massive flooding in inland towns along rivers. Meteorologists are anticipating that Florence will linger and move further inland over the weekend, which means a lot of people are going to need rescue and relief. Here’s how you can help. Local Organizations Though it’s quite easy to donate to the American Red Cross via text, and they’re incredibly well-known across the country, they’re also an organization that’s been plagued with accusations of mismanagement and other mistakes. In general, it’s often best to contribute to local groups who have a better idea of what’s needed and a smaller internal infrastructure sucking up money. For the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on those. The North Carolina Community Foundation (NCCF) is a “highly-rated charity currently providing aid to the Carolinas ahead of Florence” according to ABC News, and it partners with local charities, so you know your money is being directed by people most familiar with the area. Here’s their website for donations. There are also South Carolina and Georgia state chapters of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster who each offer recommendations of which relief organizations they would choose, if you want to investigate where your money is headed. Finally, there’s The North Carolina Disaster Fund, which purports to assist with “unmet needs in the aftermath of a disaster.” These are the groups that will be in the Carolinas helping people get back on their feet long after the waters recede. Team Rubicon Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. According to their website, they have 9,979 volunteers across VA, NC, SC, and GA and have already positioned equipment and boats along the coast to sweep in where they’re needed. Americares Americares focuses on health in disaster relief, and they currently have a response team ready for North Carolina: “The storm is on track to make a direct hit on the East Coast and impact much of the southern United States in the coming days,” Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement Monday. “Our response team has been activated and is ready to meet the immediate health needs in affected communities.” Donations to Americares are directed to emergency medicine and other health supplies, and you can contribute here. GlobalGiving GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots groups working to restore areas hit by disasters, and they’ve already started their Hurricane Florence relief fund. Some of that money will be directed towards immediate needs, but much of it will go towards long term projects restoring the community once the storm has passed. Things are… not great now.

Vulnerable animals will need to be rescued from homes where they are abandoned and shelter animals will also be in need.

SCOTT CACCIOLA,"Then there was James, who had been incredibly durable in his 16-year career. But during the Lakers Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors, he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next 17 games. Without him, the Lakers struggled. The hope was that they could regain their footing once he returned, but he was not the cure-all anyone imagined. The Lakers continued to lose with James back in the lineup, even though he said he had activated himself for a playoff push.
It had become clear by then, however, that the Lakers lacked any discernible chemistry or cohesion, especially after Johnson and Rob Pelinka, their general manager, tried and failed to acquire the All-Star center Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans ahead of Februarys trade deadline. (It was no coincidence, perhaps, that Davis and James shared the same agent, Rich Paul.) The Lakers were willing to send the Pelicans several of their promising young players, including Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Ball, but were rebuffed in their attempts to swing a blockbuster deal.
The result was a team that seemed distracted at best and fractured at worst. With their playoff hopes spiraling, the Lakers appeared to hit rock bottom on March 2 when they lost to the Phoenix Suns, one of the worst teams in the league. In a moment that quickly went viral online and appeared a fitting symbol for everything that had gone wrong for the Lakers James carelessly threw the ball off the underside of the backboard on an out-of-bounds play, leading to a turnover. Walton glowered from the bench.
Yet about two weeks later, it somehow did get worse for the Lakers: a late-game collapse and a loss to the Knicks (who were the worst team in the league) at Madison Square Garden. Not long after that, the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention. James did not dress for the final six games of the season, as the team aimed to preserve him for more meaningful games in the future.
Walton, who spent most of his 10-year N.B.A. playing career with the Lakers, winning two championships as a reserve forward, was hired as their head coach in 2016 after two seasons as an assistant with the Warriors. In 2015-16, he began the season as the Warriors interim coach while Steve Kerr recovered from debilitating back issues, and guided the team to a 39-4 record, which included a league-record 24 straight wins to start the season.
It was certainly an achievement, but the Warriors were coming off a championship and primed to excel. With the Lakers, Walton was trying to build something. Now, that massive project however onerous will continue without him.","Walton had coached the team for the past three seasons, but 2018-19, with LeBron James on board, was a disaster and brought the franchise’s sixth consecutive missed postseason.",2019-04-12T20:37:41Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Los Angeles Lakers ‘Mutually’ Part Ways With Coach Luke Walton,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/sports/luke-walton-fired-lakers.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/sports/12walton/12walton-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
ZACH SCHONBRUN,"Roberts, who also had a 43-yard punt return in the first quarter, would take punter Sam Martin’s kick to the distance a few minutes later, tiptoeing down the sideline as he eluded Lions defenders. The first game for Detroit’s new coach, Matt Patricia, looked eerily familiar to the porous performance in last year’s Super Bowl by the New England Patriots, where Patricia was the defensive coordinator. But it turned into Darnold’s night after he rebounded to complete his first N.F.L. pass, on a slant to tight end Neal Sterling. After he converted his first four third-down conversions. After he delivered a teardrop throw to Robby Anderson for 41 yards, and his first career touchdown pass, in the second quarter. By then that first horrendous interception was long forgotten. It had been a curious play call. On first down at the 25, Darnold faked the handoff to running back Bilal Powell and then rolled out to his right. He was chased by a defender. Then he looked all the way left, where Powell had leaked out down the sideline, and that’s where Darnold would throw. But his pass floated in the air for what seemed an eternity. A throw back across the full width of the field is rarely advised. In this case, it was a disaster. Safety Quandre Diggs picked it off with ease and raced into the end zone. One play, one error. Darnold walked slowly to the sideline and stood with his hands on his hips. Coach Todd Bowles passed by. So did the offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates, who gave Darnold an encouraging tap. There was a lot of game left. “I was licking my chops a little bit too much,” Darnold said. “Right when I released it, I saw the defender. I just thought, ‘Oh shoot.’ But it is what it is. You put it behind you and play the game.” It is helpful to remember that Stafford was once in a position not unlike his opponent on Monday. As a 21-year-old rookie in 2009, he started the season-opener on the road in New Orleans and threw three interceptions in a 45-27 loss. He would go on to throw 20 interceptions with 13 touchdowns passes in a 2-14 season.","Darnold’s first professional throw was an interception returned for a touchdown, but he bounced back to lead the Jets to a big win.",2018-09-11T03:37:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Jets 48, Lions 17: Jets’ Sam Darnold Turns Disaster Into Dominance in Win Over Lions",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/sports/sam-darnold-jets-lions.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/sports/11JETSprint/11JETSprint-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
Megan Farokhmanesh,"In June, alongside annual creator conference VidCon, YouTuber Tana Mongeau held her own event called TanaCon. Despite promises of free concerts, talks, and meet-and-greets with stars like Shane Dawson and Bella Thorne, the event spiraled into a disaster that was canceled after its first day. Dawson later released a three-part series featuring interviews with Mongeau and TanaCon organizer Michael Weist. Now, Weist has released his own version of events. The tedious hour-and-a-half video, “TanaCon: What Really Happened,” is a no-flair affair featuring meetings between Mongeau, Weist, and other organizers involved with the event. (Embedded shares of the video have been prohibited by the YouTube channel.) While some of the footage was previously featured in Dawson’s documentary — including a moment in which Mongeau declares that “people love to be oppressed outside” in lines — Weist’s version is, at times, excruciating in its detail. “I think TanaCon is going to provide an experience that VidCon’s not going to,” says Weist in the video. Unfortunately for everyone involved, he was correct. “TanaCon is going to provide an experience that VidCon’s not going to.” The video crawls through early meetings and into the day’s events, which largely focus on what happened inside TanaCon, rather than outside, where fans were trapped in hellish lines for hours. There is no additional commentary to add context to TanaCon, whether it’s footage of the embarrassingly sparse swag bags (including the infamous “TanaCondom,” for an event largely filled with young fans) to footage of a venue that is clearly inadequate. The video also repeatedly sticks to incorrect claims that 15,000 or even 20,000 people showed up to the event. According to Garden Grove Police after the event, officers estimated there were around 4,000 to 5,000 people. Weist has said previously that the event was disastrous for his personal finances. On October 17th, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after claiming to have lost $700,000. His video only briefly addresses the Dawson documentary and further claims that after Weist, Dawson, and Mongeau sat down to discuss the damage done, “the responsibility was left on Michael.” It concludes with a message that “Michael and Tana are no longer friends and do not speak.”","In June, alongside annual creator conference VidCon, YouTuber Tana Mongeau held her own event called TanaCon.

Victoria Song,"In an about face, Netflix has decided to pull footage of the tragic Lac-Mégantic rail accident from its original film Bird Boxalmost two months after a spokesperson said the clip will stay in the movie.
In an emailed statement to Gizmodo, a Netflix spokesperson said, Netflix and the filmmakers of Bird Box have decided to replace the clip. Were sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Mégantic community. The company declined to publicly comment further on the reason behind its sudden reversal. 
Quebecs culture and communications minister Nathalie Roy praised Netflixs decision in a tweet. Translated, the tweet reads: This gesture was expected out of respect for the victims of this horrible tragedy, their loved ones and the entire Lac-Mégantic community. This result shows that by being united and pooling our efforts, everything is possible.
Lac-Mégantic Mayor Julie Morin is also satisfied with the outcome. Yes, there was a delay, Morin told The Canadian Press, but in the end, the most important thing is that people came to the conclusion that the situation was significant enough to settle. 
Earlier this year, Netflix issued an apology for including footage of the fatal 2013 accident that claimed 47 lives. In the apology, Netflix noted that the imagery had been unwittingly sourced from stock footage, and because it was so widespread, the company could not make changes to finished content. In January, a spokesperson told the Associated Press that it will keep the clip in the movie. The clip in question was featured early on in the movie, during a breaking news montage detailing fictional mass suicides.
Needless to say, Netflixs decision did not sit well with Canadians. Roy wrote a stern letter to Netflix in January, which was also posted to Twitter. Written in French, a portion translated by The Canadian Press reads: These archives should never be used for any purpose other than for news or documentaries. We should never tolerate the use of human tragedies, whatever they are, for entertainment. Its not moral or ethical.
The Canadian Parliament also didnt take Netflixs initial refusal lightly. In January, it passed a motion in the House of Commons demanding Netflix remove the images and pay compensation to the Lac-Mégantic community. 
According to the CBC, a version of Bird Box without the controversial footage will be released in two weeks.

Victoria Song,"When Samsung announced the Galaxy Watch Active smartwatch at its Unpacked Event a few weeks ago, I was cautiously optimistic. Sure, it did away with the companys signature rotating bezel, but otherwise, it was sleek, had all the right specs, and honestly, Samsung has consistently put out some of the best Android-friendly smartwatches over the past few years. It just always seems to struggle with the leap from pretty good, to really great.
The Galaxy Watch Active is a streamlined version of its rebranded Galaxy Watch, which came out last fall. As in, its got most of the same features but in a much smaller design. You could also say its the spiritual successor to the fitness-focused Samsung Gear Sport.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active
What is it?
Samsung's streamlined fitness watch
Like
Gorgeous design. Lightweight. Good price.
No Like
Mixed accuracy. RIP rotating bezel.
But where the Gear Sport added some much-needed app partnerships to Samsungs Tizen operating system, and the Galaxy Watch advanced Samsungs overall wellness offerings and battery life, the Active doesnt really take any meaningful steps forwardaside from design.
Whatever else you want to say about the Galaxy Watch Active, this is a bee-yoo-tiful smartwatch. The 1.1-inch, 40mm AMOLED circular screen didnt overpower my lady wrist, which is a problem I run into a lot. For instance, the smaller version of the Galaxy Watch is still 42mm and while it looks nice, it was still somewhat bulky and heavy. Not so with the Active. Its light enough that I barely notice it unless Ive got it strapped on too tight. Color wise, its also got some attractive options in black, silver, rose gold, and green. I opted to test the rose gold version, because why not, and also to see how it stacked up against some other fashionable, Android-friendly watches.
Compared to the Fossil Sport, the Active just has a sleeker profile and its a bit more comfortable as the two buttons on the right side dont protrude quite as much. Side-by-side, the Active looks a bit thicker, but it also looks less chintzythe Sports nylon case really doesnt do it any favors. Meanwhile, the Misfit Vapor 2 is heavier, and has more of an industrial look overall. But where I could see the Fossil Sport and Misfit Vapor 2 working as unisex watcheseven in rose goldthe Galaxy Watch Active might just be the first smartwatch thats better suited to women.
There are two reasons for that. First, the small case size is great on petite wrists but might look downright tiny on larger wrist sizes. Second, Samsung got rid of the rotating bezel. As much as it made Tizen stand out by being the most intuitive of smartwatch operating systems, it did give all of Samsungs wearables a distinctly masculine vibe. If anything, the photo above proves that by getting rid of it, the Galaxy Watch Active is looks just as sophisticated, if not more so, than some of the best-looking smartwatches out there.
That said, nixing the rotating bezel doesnt mean the Galaxy Watch Active doesnt have one. Its frustrating, but there is a thick black ring around the Actives display. Its not as egregious as say, the border on the Fitbit Ionic or even on the Versamost of the screens and widgets utilize a black background to mask that its even there. It just highlights the fact there seems to have been plenty of room for the rotating bezel that could have been.
Does Tizen actually suffer though? Surprisingly, not reallytheres just a lot less to differentiate it from Wear OS right now. But in terms of performance, its quite snappy, and swiping between screens is fast and easy. You swipe left to view notifications, right to scroll through pre-set widgets (of which, Samsung has provided plenty), and down to view a quick settings menu. Pressing down, meanwhile, will let you choose between Samsungs preloaded clock faceswhich for me, were varied enough to find one I liked. That said, Tizen isnt quite as stacked when it comes to available apps as, say, the Apple Watch. Plus, it doesnt matter how hard Samsung triesBixby just isnt good and its not happening.
The Active does decently well on battery life as well. Samsung estimates about 45 hours with typical usage, and that about tracks if you keep continuous heart rate monitoring on. (You can get a bit more mileage if you go into settings and opt for more intermittent heart rate readings.) The most I got with the Active was roughly two full days, including one night of sleep. I gave it a quick juice before sleep tracking the next night, and 50 percent battery was enough to get me through to the next morning. Two days isnt great per se, when you consider the Fitbit Versa gets about 5 days on a single charge and the Galaxy Watch gets a superb 4-5 days depending on which version you get. But its roughly the same amount you get with the Apple Watch Series 4, and given the compact designforgivable.
To take the sting out of the two-day battery life, Samsung says you can wirelessly charge the device via a Galaxy S10 phone. And that is coolkinda. It just requires that youre already in the Samsung ecosystem, have an S10, and dont mind incapacitating both your phone and watch while it charges. I tried it out and the Wireless Power Sharing feature definitely worksits just not fast and you do need to position it in exactly the right way to keep it charging. At the end of the day, the idea of waiting 58 minutes with my phone face down to charge 38 percent seems more of a gimmick than practical.
Inside, the Active is packing an accelerometer, built-in GPS, gyroscope, barometer, and heart rate monitor. Its rated for 5 ATM of water resistance, which is basically what a smartwatch needs to be called swim-proof. Its also got NFC payments and on-board music storage up to 4GB. In 2019, this is the basic spec soup you need for a decent fitness-minded smartwatch.
On the fitness front, there are a few things the Active does really well. For starters, Im a fan of its automatic activity tracking for running and walking. Basically, if youre out and about for roughly 10 minutes, the watch notices and starts recording. Thats great if youre absent-minded, like yours truly. Its also got 39 different activities you can choose from, which is a nice change from the limited options that you get with some other, more expensive smartwatches.
So if kicking the rotating bezel wasnt the end of the world, the battery life is decent, the hardware is solid, and the design is goodwhat gives? Sadly, the same thing thats held back every Samsung wearable to date: The software.
On a one-mile treadmill walk at 3.5 miles per hour, the Galaxy Watch Active tracked 1,705 steps compared to the 2,126 steps logged by my control pedometer, the Yamax SW-200 Digi-Walker. Thats a cringe-worthy difference of 19.8 percent. Running didnt fare much better. A one-mile run at 5mph resulted in 1,664 steps to the Yamaxs 1,951 stepsa difference of 14.7 percent. Thats also not great. Generally, most fitness trackers and smartwatches I test tend to be somewhere in the 2-5 percent range. For instance, I tested the Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition at the same time and got much more accurate 1.08 percent and 1.03 percent differentials for walking and running, respectively.
When it came to heart rate, the Active did somewhat better. During mid-run checks, it was within 5 beats per minute of my Polar H10 chest strap. It was also roughly on par with the Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition. That said, on a separate, open-ended 17-minute interval run, I encountered an odd glitch. The watch just could not get a read on my heart rate at all. The entirety of the run was recorded as a flat-line 120 beats per minute, which I know to be untrue because: 1) the only time your heart rate is static is when youre dead; and 2) I have data from other trackers worn simultaneously that prove otherwise.
This struck me as odd because itd done fine on my treadmill tests just minutes before. Later in the day, I noticed the watch was struggling to get consistent reads on my heart rate in general. I was futzing around with the stress monitoring, and I was surprised to see that three hours after my run, it was still pegging me as highly stressed out when in fact, I was super chill on my couch. I cleaned off the optical heart rate monitor just in case it was my greasy sweat that was mucking up readings, but it wasnt until I hard rebooted the watch that it started functioning normally again.
This inconsistency bled over into sleep tracking. While you can get a breakdown of your sleep stages, I had multiple nights where the Active just could not get a read on my heart rate and thus, did not track my sleep. When it did manage to track my sleep, it was a mixed bag. One night it was just wildly wrong. The next, it was basically on par with the results of my Fitbit.
None of this gave me much hope for the watchs blood pressure monitoring feature. The company was suspiciously silent about it at the Unpacked event, and for good reason. It requires a separate appMy BP Lab 2.0which launched late on March 15 and did not seem to meet some consumer expectations if reviews on Google Play Store are to be believed. The app itself also requires users to take an initial reading via a traditional blood pressure cuff before it uses the optical sensor to measure your heart rate and stress levels to monitor readings going forward. Its not exactly fair to ding Samsung on that, however, as the company has been transparent about the feature being part of beta research and not a full-blown, FDA-cleared blood pressure monitoring tool.
The good news is a lot of these issues are software related, and theres a chance that Samsung will push out fixes to make the Galaxy Watch Active a more consistent health wearable in the next few weeks. If it can manage that, then the $200 Active is an excellent buy. The GPS-only Apple Watch Series 4 costs twice as much, and in terms of design, the Active is just way more appealing than Fitbits Versa. Tizen, even with its slightly scantier app offerings, delivers a better OS experience than Googles Wear OS. So honestly, if health tracking takes a backseat, the Active is still a decently good option. Most of my beef is that it could have been a great one.

Tizen is pretty snappy and works well enough with swipes, even if its app offerings are scanty.
While the hardware is solid, the software is a mixed bag. Health tracking tests delivered mixed accuracy, and there were a few issues with heart rate monitoring.

Catie Keck,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency may have put the personally identifying information of millions of disaster survivors at risk of fraud and identity theft, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General.
The March 15 report said that during an audit of FEMAs Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, it found that the agency shared and subsequently exposed the personal data of 2.3 million survivors of a number of natural disasters that included the 2017 California wildfires as well as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Survivors of these incidents provided their private information to FEMA in order to obtain assistance such as temporary housing. The audit found that FEMA jeopardized private information that the agency collected about applicants when it unnecessarily released some of that information to an undisclosed contractor handling its TSA program.
FEMA, the report stated, shared with the contractor more than 20 unnecessary data fields for survivors participating in the TSA program, including bank names, account numbers, and home addresses.
FEMA Press Secretary Lizzie Litzow told Gizmodo in a statement by email on Friday that since becoming aware of the issue, the agency has has taken aggressive measures to correct this error, including by conducting its own audit of the contractors information system. Litzow also said FEMA is no longer sharing what the OIG identified as unnecessary information with the contractor.
To date, FEMA has found no indicators to suggest survivor data has been compromised, Litzow said. FEMA has also worked with the contractor to remove the unnecessary data from the system and updated its contract to ensure compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cybersecurity and information-sharing standards. As an added measure, FEMA instructed contracted staff to complete additional DHS privacy training.
A DHS official who spoke with the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said that it did not have information that any data had been compromised. He did, however, tell the Post that the banking information of 1.8 million individuals had been exposed in the breach, with roughly three-quarters of a million addresses also exposed.
The agency said Friday its goal remains protecting and strengthening the integrity, effectiveness, and security of our disaster programs that help people before, during, and after disasters.

AJ Dellinger,"The old adage about a lie traveling halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on has been made true thanks to Twitter. According to a new study, the vast majority of people using the platform during disasters and breaking news events spread false information without ever getting it a second thought. Researchers at the University at Buffalo examined more than 20,000 tweets sent during Hurricane Sandy and the Boston Marathon bombing. In their findings published in the journal Natural Hazards, they revealed between 86 to 91 percent of the users spread misinformation by retweeting or liking tweets, and less than one in five people tried to correct the falsehoods. The researchers honed in on four specific widespread, false rumors that made the rounds during the two major events. It found that Twitter users often expressed little to no skepticism when presented with those bits of fake news—most just clicked like or retweet and moved on. Just five to nine percent of people sought to confirm the information by asking if it was correct, while as little as one percent of users expressed doubt or said the original tweet was inaccurate. Even once the tweets were debunked by trustworthy sources, users made little effort to make sure their followers were properly informed. Less than 20 percent of users clarified the false information with a new tweet, and less than 10 percent bothered to delete the tweet. “These findings are important because they show how easily people are deceived during times when they are most vulnerable and the role social media platforms play in these deceptions,” Jun Zhuang, the study’s lead author, said in a statement. The findings of the University at Buffalo seem to jibe with an MIT study earlier this year that found false news stories were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories. MIT researchers also looked at tweets from the Boston Marathon bombing and found that facts took six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for falsehoods. Much has been made of fake news since the 2016 presidential election, and companies like Twitter and Facebook have been urged to take action to prevent malicious actors from hijacking the platforms and using them for misinformation campaigns and propaganda. The problem is, it’s often regular, everyday people spreading fake news with no real regard for whether it’s real or not. Social media platforms make it easier to spread that information, but people are inherently drawn to headlines that are sensational and cause an emotional rise. Often times, those stories just aren’t true. Facebook has gone through a number of iterations in its attempts to limit the spread of fake news on its platform, occasionally to disastrous results. At one point the company placed red warning labels on debunked articles to discourage people from spreading them. That upset users who believed the stories to be true and resulted in the articles being shared even more. Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook play a weird role here. They enable the spread of information, both real and fake. It just so happens users are much better at spreading the fake stuff, and now the companies are being pressed to serve as fact-checkers and gatekeepers when that was never their express intent. Social networks need to do better, sure. But so do the people who use those platforms.

George Dvorsky,"Earlier today, the VSS Unity went supersonic during crewed tests, reaching speeds of 1,220 miles per hour. It’s the first powered flight of Virgin Galactic’s new SpaceShipTwo aircraft, and the first flight since the 2014 disaster in which a pilot was killed and a co-pilot severely injured. After detaching from the carrier mothership VMS Eve, and gliding above the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, the VSS Unity fired its rocket engines for about 30 seconds, attaining a maximum speed of Mach 1.6. The experimental spaceplane, with its crew of two, landed shortly thereafter at around 12:05 pm ET, according to Virgin Galactic. Though just a test, it’s an important milestone for the Richard Branson-led company, which aims to eventually offer suborbital flights to space tourists. Back on October 31, 2014, Unity ’s predecessor, the VSS Enterprise, crashed, killing the pilot and badly injuring the co-pilot, who survived by deploying his parachute. An official investigation found that the craft’s braking system had been deployed prematurely by the co-pilot, resulting in the “in-flight anomaly.” All ensuing flight tests were canceled as Virgin Galactic worked to remedy the various deficiencies, both procedural and mechanical. Two years ago, the private company introduced an updated version of the spaceplane that would replace the destroyed SpaceShipTwo craft. The Enterprise was built by aircraft developer Scaled Composites, but the updated version was manufactured by The Spaceship Company, a California-based subsidiary of Virgin Galactic. The VSS Unity, named by the late physicist Stephen Hawking, had been undergoing engine and gliding tests over the past several months. Today’s successful test, with pilots Mark Stucky and Dave Mackay at the helm, means the company can continue to move forward with its plans. Eventually, Virgin Galactic would like to have a fleet of these SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplanes, each capable of carrying paying customers 68 miles above the Earth’s surface—a full six miles higher than the so-called Kármán line, which is conventionally used to mark the edge of space—and back. The estimated price tag for a single trip will be $250,000, but the spaceplane could also be used to carry science equipment and measuring devices to high altitudes for NASA and other organizations.

Tom McKay,"Authorities said this weekend that the death toll from an industrial disaster in Brumadinho, Brazil in Minas Gerais state has climbed to at least 34, with some officials saying that the true toll could reach the hundreds, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.
Thats a sharp increase from a prior count of 11 deaths from the disaster on Friday, in which a 280-foot dam owned by multinational mining giant Vale S.A. collapsed, flooding the area with almost 12 million cubic meters of sludge-like mining waste (known as tailings). The Journal wrote that one congresswoman, Áurea Carolina, referred to Vales destroyed dining facility as a cemetery. There cant be any life there, only hundreds of bodies.
The paper added that prospects of rescuing more survivors are fading quickly:
The sludge that buried the area is hardening fast, rescue officials told Ms. Carolina and other lawmakers visiting the site, making rescue attempts even more difficult and dimming the chances of finding survivors.
 Rescue workers have also pulled dozens of survivors from the thick, slippery mud. The number of people who are unaccounted for continues to change, as more people are reported missing and others get in touch with co-workers, family members or authorities. The current estimate is that about 300 people are still missing.
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said at a press conference on Friday that Vales work facilities and nearby living areas were flooded so quickly that anyone alerted to the disaster would have no time to escape, the Journal added. At least 256 people remain missing, CNN reported.
I saw a gigantic cloud of dust and a wave of mud, contractor Mayke Ferreira told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, according to the Observer. It was one wave on top of another.
We know now that the chances of having survivors are minimal and that we will probably rescue bodies, state governor Romeu Zema said, the Observer wrote.
While the cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the Brazilian environmental agency, Ibama, has already slapped Vale with a 250 million reais (about $66 million USD) fine for causing pollution, destroying the habitability of the environment, and other other regulatory violations, the Observer noted. Prosecutors have also moved to freeze roughly $1.3 billion in Vale funds for relief efforts.
As the Journal noted, a dam failure at a joint Vale-BHP Billiton Ltd facility in November 2015 killed at least 19 people, resulting in tens of billions of dollars in compensation claims. Lindsay Newland Bowker, founder of dam failure World Mine Tailing Failures, which studies such disasters, told the Journal that local authorities and Vale didnt learn anything from the first accident, other than that they were much quicker to form a response team, to rescue people and to evaluate the environmental damage.
 Per the Observer, Vale said the mine was judged safe during inspections and that it was being decommissioned at the time of the disaster, though the National Civil Society Forum for Hydrographic Basins said it had urged authorities to deny Vale a license renewal. An Ibama official also said during a meeting last year that some locals were very worried, with good reason. Another Ibama official, speaking anonymously to the Observer, questioned how a company reckless enough to build an administrative complex at the bottom of a mining-waste dam continued to get approval.
The New York Times noted that the mining disaster is also a political crisis for new President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who openly mocked environmental regulations on the campaign trail. He labeled environmental fines an industry that must be eliminated and promised to open up large swathes of protected land to mining operations, the Times wrote.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"You alright, Spain? In what is most certainly a contender for worst art restoration project, a 500-year-old wooden effigy of San Jorge de Estella in the Spanish city of Estella-Lizarra has been, uh, restored by a “handicrafts teacher,” according to the Guardian. The end result isn’t a pretty sight, and has left some people more than upset, myself included. The 500-year-old wooden effigy of San Jorge de Estella stands in the Chapel of San Jorge, located in the Church of San Miguel. San Jorge himself is clad in armor and mounted on a horse, trampling a dragon. The statue can only be seen during hours of worship. The restoration itself, commissioned by one of the parish’s priests, was done by Karmacolor, a school in the nearby town of Navarra. The school has since removed its Facebook page, which previously contained images and videos showcasing the restoration in progress, according to ArtUs. San Jorge de Estella’s new look completely erases the subtle features of the original (like the rosy cheeks and lips, and the shading and wear of the armor). His restored face addresses the admittedly faded shading and coloring, but makes San Jorge look more like a Moral Orel character instead of a knight in conflict with a giant mythical creature. In addition, aspects of the sculpture were recolored, like the red harness which was originally silver with gold leaf, according to art restoration expert Carmen Usua, who spoke to Spanish newspaper ABC. Usua suggested that a proper re-restoration could be impossible, because the wood was sanded incorrectly and the plaster work was subpar. Spain, judging from this and past catastrophes alone, it would seem like art restoration isn’t exactly your bag. Remember Elias Garcia Martinez’s 18th century Ecce Homo fresco in Borja, Spain? You’re probably more familiar with its Ecce Mono designation after its botched restoration. You also had that 2016 disaster involving the statue of Saint Michael the Archangel from the 17th century. Ouch. Like the Ecce Mono, San Jorge de Estella was reportedly restored in the absence of discussion with cultural institutions or restoration experts. The Association of Conservators and Restauradores of Spain (ACRE) has denounced the restoration project, and says it will bring the issue to the Prosecutor’s Office of Navarra to determine the scope of the damages and see that a penalty is imposed in the form of a fine for the destruction of property with cultural and historical value. To be fair, it’s hard to be too mad at someone who made a good faith effort to restore priceless cultural artifacts. It could be worse, you know? Imagine if they broke it.","You alright, Spain?

Sean Hollister,"Netflix has finally decided that its original horror movie Bird Box doesn’t need to contain footage of the real-life train disaster that killed 47 people in Lac-Mégantic, Canada in 2013. Originally, in the face of protests from the Canadian town and online supporters, Netflix tacitly refused to remove footage of the exploding train, which the film used in a fictional news report at the beginning of the movie. But now, nearly three months after Bird Box started streaming on Netflix and nearly two months after the protest, the company agreed to remove the material. A new version, which will replace the real-life derailment with fictional footage from an unspecified older TV series, should be available on Netflix globally in a matter of weeks. “Netflix and the filmmakers of Bird Box have decided to replace the clip,” reads part of a company statement provided to The Verge and other publications. “We’re sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Mégantic community.” According to The Canadian Press, Lac-Mégantic’s Mayor Julie Morin is satisfied with the outcome: “Yes, there was a delay, but in the end, the most important thing is that people came to the conclusion that the situation was significant enough to settle.” “This result shows that by being in solidarity and by putting our efforts together, anything is possible,” tweeted Nathalie Roy, the town’s minister of culture and communications. It’s possible Netflix benefitted from the delay Still, the late response means it’s possible that Bird Box has already had the lion’s share of its viewership. Scandals often tend to make people rush to see something quicker than they might normally have, and Bird Box had more than one — in additional to the train derailment outcry, there was also the potentially dangerous, viral Bird Box challenge that saw YouTube creators trying to spend 24 hours living their lives with a blindfold on.

Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday before being downgraded to a tropical storm. SEE ALSO: There's a glaring weakness in electric vehicles. (It's range anxiety.) As NPR reported, Tesla can remotely tap into the max capacity of its 75 kWh batteries in Model S and X vehicles, adding about 30 more miles of range. In any natural disaster situation like this, our policy is to make Superchargers free of use in order to optimize evacuation routes for affected customers https://t.co/SOUlKv3UUZ — Tesla (@Tesla) September 13, 2018 Tesla owners were notified that Tesla had enabled the additional battery capacity. They were also offered free Supercharging, which gets batteries to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. ""We hope that this gives you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,"" the notification read. Normal battery configurations will return mid-October. Tesla also extended battery range last year during Hurricane Irma. On GM vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac, all OnStar members have access to Crisis Assist services during disasters like Florence even if they don't usually subscribe. That means people can use their cars to navigate out of disaster zones, find hotels, gas, or use their vehicles as a WiFi hotspot. Mary Ann Adams, disaster response and crisis incident manager for OnStar, said in a phone call Friday that 25,000 calls had come in since Tuesday through the Crisis Assist service to always-available response teams. ""Since cars are connected they provide connections they may not have,"" she said about people in the storm zone. For many the OnStar tools mean access to a working phone and a charging source. For others it's a way to find a hotel or the latest storm updates. ""I think of it as another tool to survive the storm and navigate the storm,"" she said. After a storm, calls tick up again as damage is assessed and further evacuations may be required. For some it's a matter of checking to see if they can return home. If they can, signage and roads may be destroyed, prompting more calls to the command center. As of Friday afternoon, according to the New York Times, four deaths have been linked to the storm.

Rhett Jones,"It’s almost been a year since the White House held its last big tech summit. On Thursday, it will reportedly host representatives from 38 of the biggest companies in the US to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and how the government can help us avoid disaster. The anti-science Trump administration has been slow to address many of the issues that technology poses in our current time and the complex problems it promises for the future. According to the Washington Post, it’s slowly realizing that it doesn’t have the option to turn a blind eye to tech and it wants to get serious about what the government needs to do to address the coming AI revolution. From the report: The Trump administration intends to ask academics, government officials and AI developers about ways to adapt regulations to advance AI in such fields as agriculture, health care and transportation, according to a draft schedule of the event. And they’re set to discuss the U.S. government’s power to fund cutting-edge research into such technologies as machine learning. Among those expected to be in the room for that private gathering Thursday will be representatives from tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia and Oracle, as well as other businesses like Ford, Land O’Lakes, Mastercard, Pfizer and United Airlines, according to the White House. Slated to represent Facebook is Jerome Pesenti, its vice president of AI, the company confirmed. Amazon plans to send Rohit Prasad, the head scientist for its voice-assistant Alexa. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich is also expected to attend. The administration has done its best to purge scientific and technical expertise from the EPA, the White House, NASA, and other agencies. And just one year ago, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told a reporter that job automation wasn’t even on his radar and he believes its a problem that’s “50 to 100"" years away. But that flippancy can’t hold. The US government suddenly seems quite alarmed by China’s tech advances and it has been ramping up a cold war with companies it believes have Chinese interests at heart. At the same time, job automation poses a threat to the economy—one of the few ongoing talking points that Trump points to as a success for his team. Thursday’s summit is being framed as a first step in getting everyone on the same page about what has to be done for investment and innovation to keep pace with our rivals and anticipate the consequences of an AI-driven world. Any talk of universal basic income or free college tuition seems unlikely, but the Post says discussions about increased funding and potential regulatory barriers are likely on the table. Companies like Facebook and Amazon may be sending their best and their brightest, but it doesn’t seem like the CEOs will be putting themselves through the humiliation of being in Trump’s vicinity this time around. We’re not even sure if Trump will be there. The White House hasn’t released a statement on the summit yet, and Gizmodo has requested more information. Getting a bunch of tech experts in a room with people who could actually affect some sort of change could be the best option. The last big tech summit was reportedly spent buttering up Trump’s ego in order to get him to listen to the most basic issues. There’s also no word if Jared Kushner will be there. Kushner was originally the White House’s tech guy, but he hasn’t been in the public eye lately. What’s up with that?

Tom McKay,"On Monday night, President Donald Trump announced his second Supreme Court nominee of his term: the DC Court of Appeals’ Judge Brett Kavanaugh. On a range of issues—but particularly net neutrality, the principle that service providers should be required to treat all data on their networks equally—he is likely to be a total disaster if confirmed by the Senate. For the National Security Agency and big businesses that hate regulation, though, he’ll be great. Kavanaugh is a steadfast conservative, the New York Times wrote, particularly in his decisions on the “Second Amendment, religious freedom, [and] campaign finance.” He’s also issued “vigorous opinions hostile to administrative agencies, a central concern of the modern conservative legal movement.” That included the Barack Obama-era decision by the Federal Communications Commission to enforce net neutrality rules on the service providers that act as gatekeepers to the modern internet, the same rules the Republican-controlled FCC recently revoked. According to a rundown from Politico earlier on Monday, Kavanaugh dissented from a ruling upholding the FCC’s net neutrality rules in May 2017. Kavanaugh wrote that the FCC mandate was “unlawful and must be vacated.” In particular, Kavanaugh believes that the FCC did not have the power to impose the rules by itself—which would require congressional intervention to fix—and contended that its actions also violated the First Amendment. Kavanaugh wrote: First, Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule. Congress has debated net neutrality for many years, but Congress has never enacted net neutrality legislation or clearly authorized the FCC to impose commoncarrier obligations on Internet service providers. The lack of clear congressional authorization matters. As for the First Amendment issue, he argued that ISPs essentially act as editorial operations when they make decisions about content and the government needs to clear high hurdles to regulate those decisions: Second and in the alternative, the net neutrality rule violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Under the Supreme Court’s landmark decisions in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180 (1997), the First Amendment bars the Government from restricting the editorial discretion of Internet service providers, absent a showing that an Internet service provider possesses market power in a relevant geographic market. Here, however, the FCC has not even tried to make a market power showing. Therefore, under the Supreme Court’s precedents applying the First Amendment, the net neutrality rule violates the First Amendment.... The threshold question is whether the First Amendment applies to Internet service providers when they exercise editorial discretion and choose what content to carry and not to carry. The answer is yes. Later in the decision, Kavanaugh wrote that ISPs are not fundamentally different in this manner from cable companies and bookstores, both of which make decisions about what kind of content to carry or not. He argued that while exceptions exist in situations where “market-distorting monopoly power” threaten to limit the availability of content to consumers, the FCC did not bother to prove that was the case, and warned of a slippery slope if regulators were allowed to impose rules without demonstrating so: Consider the implications if the law were otherwise. If market power need not be shown, the Government could regulate the editorial decisions of Facebook and Google, of MSNBC and Fox, of NYTimes.com and WSJ.com, of YouTube and Twitter. Can the Government really force Facebook and Google and all of those other entities to operate as common carriers? Can the Government really impose forced-carriage or equal-access obligations on YouTube and Twitter? If the Government’s theory in this case were accepted, then the answers would be yes. After all, if the Government could force Internet service providers to carry unwanted content even absent a showing of market power, then it could do the same to all those other entities as well. 2016 FCC data shows that 56 million American households out of 118 million have no access to or only one choice of high-speed broadband provider, while only 6.9 million have a choice of three or more. But Kavanaugh conveniently cited an article arguing that “vibrant competition” exists in the form of wireless providers. (The argument that wireless internet is a substitute for broadband is too much even for Ajit Pai’s FCC, which backed down on a boneheaded plan to redefine service standards this way in January.) Beyond net neutrality, Kavanaugh seems like he would be a reliable enemy to proponents of digital privacy and federal regulatory agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency. As Politico noted in a separate article, Kavanaugh upheld rulings that the NSA’s massive metadata collection program was legal, citing the “third-party doctrine” that collecting records from service providers does not constitute a search of the customer. He added that the program constituted a “special need” overriding individual privacy protections. ( CNET wrote that the Supreme Court “recently ruled against the third-party doctrine for location history data,” though it is possible a court with Kavanaugh on it could go the other way.) Kavanaugh additionally argued in another case that monitoring the movements of a criminal suspect’s car via GPS surveillance device without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, Politico wrote, since there is no reasonable presumption of privacy in a person’s public movements. However, the site noted he wrote an additional statement arguing that actually tampering with the car itself without a warrant was illegal. Per TechCrunch, Kavanaugh also believes that the CFPB—the agency created in 2011 as part of the Dodd–Frank financial reform law—is unconstitutional. Kavanaugh’s opposition is based on the independent agency being managed by a single director who cannot be fired by the president, which proponents say allows it to aggressively respond to potential wrongdoing (say, the Equifax hack ) and conservatives argue makes the agency unaccountable. The agency is currently managed by Mick Mulvaney, who is doing his best to destroy it with or without Kavanaugh’s help. In another case, the Washington Post noted, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA should have to consider how much it costs for coal- and oil-fired power plants to reduce their emissions of toxic chemicals like mercury, dissenting from other justices who upheld the pollution standards. As noted by ThinkProgress, in another case regarding the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, he appeared amenable to neutering the EPA’s authority to enforce new regulations. Other tech-related arguments by Kavanaugh flagged by Bloomberg BNA include throwing out Federal Aviation Authority rules requiring drone registration. If confirmed, he may also have the opportunity to weigh in on a case regarding whether public access TV channels count as public forums. Republicans in the Senate are gearing up to push Kavanaugh through before the 2018 midterm elections, and it is very likely they will succeed. Confirmation is not assured, with a number of GOP swing votes potentially capable of tanking his nomination. However, a number of Democrats could also cave. The New York Times noted that pushback from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell arguing that some of Kavanaugh’s rivals for the nomination would face easier confirmation processes only seems to have deepened Trump’s resolve.","On Monday night, President Donald Trump announced his second Supreme Court nominee of his term: the DC Court of Appeals’ Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Mark Kaufman,"Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river. While several factors resulted in this Maryland town's second ""1,000-year storm"" occurring in just the last 22 months, one increasingly significant contribution to the flooding is the amount of water vapor accumulating in Earth's warming atmosphere. The flooding in Maryland fits within the broader context of how human-caused climate change is altering our atmosphere, making these extreme events more commonplace in the future. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year NASA scientists say that average global temperatures have been on a ""rapid warming trend"" in the last four decades. This warming means that the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. Accordingly, this loads storm systems with more water. ""So when it rains, it really, really pours, in the future — and now,"" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""This is super basic physics and chemistry,"" said Marvel of increased temperatures allowing the air to absorb more water. Today, the consequences of this elementary science are pummeling the U.S. ""We’ve already observed an increase in heavy precipitation events,"" said Marvel. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing extreme, single day downpours have been on the rise since the late 1970s. The United States' 2014 National Climate Assessment — guided by 13 federal agencies — found that ""Across most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent."" ""Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions,"" the report added. Image: U.S. government/National climate assessment That said, Marvel emphasizes it's inaccurate to say that any extreme downpour was the direct or single result of more water vapor being held in the warmer air. Destructive weather will still happen — but now it has an added kick — human-induced global warming. ""Unlucky, bad things happen all the time,"" said Marvel. ""Weather happens, but we know what climate change is doing."" Tropical cyclones, for example, have ravaged U.S. coastlines throughout history, and will continue to do so. The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto — which is not a hurricane but is still carrying bounties of water — has now causing flooding so severe in North Carolina that the National Weather Service tweeted ""HEED ALL EVACUATION ORDERS IMMEDIATELY!"" in areas around the Lake Tahoma dam.

KIRK JOHNSON,"By giving scientists, officials and the people who live nearby so much time to stew over what could be happening, the slow-motion nature of the slide — at least so far — has already created tensions. About 75 people have been evacuated from nearby houses that may or may not ever be damaged. The local road at the foot of the hillside has been closed. Irrigation canal operators stand ready to open dams and take water from the river if it is blocked by a rock slide. Alternate highway routes have been mapped out, in case the interstate becomes impassable. Current projections, based on dozens of motion sensors that have been installed on the ridge, suggest that the collapse is most likely to happen sometime in late February. “In a lot of disasters, you don’t have as much warning as months — hardly any,” said Jeff Emmons, the emergency management director for Yakima County. “It’s a unique thing.” CANADA Spokane Seattle WASHINGTON Union Gap OREGON Portland 100 Miles BIRCHFIELD RD. 82 97 THORP RD. 1 mile In the last few weeks, the main mass of rock has been moving toward a gravel quarry at the base of the ridge. The company that runs the quarry has stopped operations and has voluntarily offered to put up evacuated residents in nearby hotels for five weeks at its own expense, though the cause of the crack has yet to be formally determined. Some things, though, are clear. The slide is occurring in a rumpled layer cake of volcanic rock, or basalt, laid down by eruptions that began about 17 million years ago, interspersed with thin deposits of silt and other sediments. Over time, the layers have folded upward, forming the ridge, and the topmost basalt layer is now sliding over the sedimentary layer beneath it. Many landslides are caused by infiltration of rainwater or groundwater, but geologists think that water is not involved in this case at all, just gravity. That makes Rattlesnake Ridge a sharp contrast to the recent mudslides in California, which were caused by rain and erosion on lands loosened by fires — at least 21 people dead, with many more still missing — or the devastating Oso landslide in northern Washington State nearly four years ago, which killed 43 people, after weeks of heavy rain. Still, all these events reflect the restlessness of the earth and nature that is part of Pacific Rim life. Even the name of the town, Union Gap, is a testament to natural violence: It refers to the huge gash in the ridgeline carved thousands of years ago by a colossal flood from ancient Lake Missoula. That lake once covered much of Montana, and when the Ice Age dam that constrained it broke apart, its waters left scars across the northwest as they roared toward the Pacific Ocean.

"Daniel Setiawan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Huaraz, Peru –From a stone hut perched on the edge of the glacial lake Palcacocha, 14,980 feet above sea level, Juan Victor Morales radios down to a dispatcher in the city of Huaraz below. He is all that stands between the city and disaster. Today, it’s just a routine call, one the wind-chapped lookout makes every two hours during his fifteen day shift. Speaking into the handset of the CB radio, Morales reports the temperature, the amount of precipitation, and the level of the lake, then pauses to listen to the sound of a distant avalanche. “Don’t worry, that one is far away,” he says after the last echo of the avalanche’s rumble has faded out. He isn’t spooked: After all, there are avalanches here practically every day. Morales is one of two men tasked with standing sentinel over Lake Palcacocha, which sits high in the Cordillera Blanca mountains east of the 120,000-strong city of Huaraz. His job is to warn the residents of Huaraz in the event of a glacial lake outburst flood—a sudden breach in the lake’s natural dam, which could be caused by large chunks of glacial ice from an avalanche falling into the lake. The displacement of water would create a wave that some University of Texas models predict could be as tall as 100 feet. Such a wave would easily smash through the moraine dam, an accumulation of rocks and sediment that forms along a glacier’s edge. Billions of gallons of water would rush down the valley into the city of Huaraz some 12 miles (20 km) away and 3,200 feet (1,000 meters) below, destroying everything in its path. “We have to be ready for anything,” Morales says. “There could be a big avalanche or an earthquake, the moraine could fall, then there would be a big flood.” It’s a problem threatening not only Huarez, but mountainous communities around the world. As global warming continues unchecked, alpine glaciers from the Andes to the Alps are melting at record speeds, creating a host of challenges for the people that depend on them for water, energy, and food. Now, NGOs and government officials are scrambling to shore up Huarez’s defenses while some residents are taking on big energy companies directly—a strategy which could serve as a template for similarly-threatened communities around the world. Just before dawn on December 13th, 1941 an avalanche sent large blocks of ice into Lake Palcacocha, creating waves that crashed through the moraine dam. The water that rushed out of the ever-increasing rupture poured into another lake called Jircacocha located just over a mile below, also destroying its dam. The combined contents of the two lakes then rushed into the town of Huaraz, appearing to the sleepy residents as a 50 to 100-foot high wall of water and ice, mud, rock, trees, houses, livestock, and human bodies that crashed through the city with unrelenting force. Up to 5000 people died and nearly a third of the city was destroyed in the glacial lake outburst flood of 1941. Today, it’s hard to imagine that such a disaster took place. Fueled by tourism, Huaraz has grown into the second largest city in the central Peruvian Andes—its population has quadrupled since 1941. The streets bustle with hikers, climbers, and other adventure seeking tourists from around the world. A host of businesses cater to them, offering everything from knock-off North Face jackets to roasted Guinea pig. Meanwhile, unseen in the mountains to the east of the city, Lake Palcacocha has also grown. Today the volume of the lake is 34 times greater than it was in 1941, according to national authorities, a ticking time bomb of 4.5 billion gallons of water. Lake levels rose so high in 2011 that authorities declared a state of emergency and installed flexible tubes to siphon water out of the lake. This emergency measure succeeded in lowering the lake by 20 feet (six meters), but many glaciologists believe that’s not nearly enough. “The regular citizen of Huaraz does not think, oh we need to do something about this lake because I need to save my life. They don’t see the risk,” Jahir Anicama Diaz, the regional coordinator for CARE, an NGO working to implement an early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha, tells me. On the walls of his office are maps of the city showing evacuation routes, the high risk neighborhoods painted in yellow, orange, and red. “We don’t only need to control the lake,” he says, “but also increase the resilience of the people.” After more than a decade of delay, the early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha should be in place by the end of this year, but a reinforced dam is still years down the line. The $4 million dollar scheme to secure the lake has been slow moving, plagued by government corruption and bogged down by negotiations between competing interests, including national and regional governments, local communities, farmers, glaciologists, engineers, NGOs, and hydroelectric companies. “This is climate injustice.” Unable to just sit and watch from the sidelines, some, like local farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano LLiuya, have taken matters into their own hands. In 2015, LLiuya sued Germany energy company RWE, one of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gases. Although RWE has no presence in Peru, LLiuya argues that the energy giant has still played a major role in causing climate change and the loss of Peru’s glaciers. “What I want is for the companies that contribute to climate change to take responsibility,” says LLiuya, whose case is supported by the NGO Germanwatch. “Here we suffer the consequences for something that we are not responsible for. This is climate injustice.” After a district court in Essen, Germany dismissed LLiuya’s case in December 2015, a higher court in Hamm agreed to hear it, making it the first time a company will be tried for climate change-related charges in Europe. The case is largely symbolic. LLiuya is only asking $20,000 dollars from RWE—an amount proportionate to the.05 percent of global CO2 emissions that the company is purportedly responsible for. If he wins, the money would go to the national government to be used for the lake securitization project currently underway. Even if he doesn’t win, LLiuya is happy that the case has brought international attention to the immediate threat climate change is posing to vulnerable communities not just in Peru, but in countries around the world. “Every time I go up into the mountains, every year, I see the glaciers are less and less,” says Lliuya, who has been guiding tourists into the mountains for 17 years. “I felt I had an obligation to do something. We all do.” Scientists estimate that Andean glaciers have lost 1600 years of ice in the last 25 years alone, and in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru’s highest and most glaciated mountain range, glaciers have shrunk 35 percent in the past forty years, according to authorities. Beyond Huaraz, these glaciers supply water to the farms and cities in the desert lowlands. With that was supply today melting faster than it can be replenished, many experts fear shortages down the line. “In not a very long time, 10 years maybe, we are going to have really big problems, conflicts with water,” says Cesar Portocarrero Rodriguez, former head of the National Glacier Unit in Huaraz. “We already have problems with water in some parts of Peru,” he says, “but the big problem is coming. These are just the small signs.” Those small signs, though, matter tremendously to front-lines communities like Huaraz. Looking out upon Palcacocha, Morales is hopeful that glacial experts will be able to divert disaster. The new early warning system is nearing installation, and preliminary studies for the dam are moving along. It’s a bright, sunny day, and the clouds sweeping over the mountains are unthreatening. You can see the snow capped peaks reflected in the azure waters of the lake. It is hard to believe something so beautiful could also be so deadly. “But who knows how much time we have,” Morales muses. He admits that he fears for the safety of his family and friends who live in the valley below. “Every day I see the glacier changing,” he says. “And it appears it is a problem around the world.

Rhett Jones,"Coinbase, one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, has apparently had a nasty bug lurking in its system that would allow users to collect unlimited ether through a few simple steps. Thanks to a bug report, however, the company avoided disaster. VI Company, a Dutch firm specializing in FinTech, publicly disclosed the vulnerability on its HackerOne account on Wednesday. According to the report, a string of digital wallets controlled by a smart contract could be manipulated to trick Coinbase into believing a transfer had occurred. The issue was first reported in late December, and Coinbase responded on January 25th saying the issue had been resolved and that the company would be rewarded with a $10,000 bounty. Smart contracts have been touted as one of the main arguments for why the Ethereum blockchain technology could have more potential than Bitcoin. In the most basic terms, a smart contract is a set of if/then conditions regulating the transfer of cryptocurrency funds. VI Company wanted to give its employees a unique Christmas present last year, and familiarize them with smart contracts. It set up a smart contract that would distribute a small amount of ether to everyone on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. But it noticed something weird. The people handling the project realized that if one of the internal transactions of the contract failed, all the transactions were reversed, which is how the smart contract should work. But Coinbase’s internal accounts didn’t register the reversal. So, Coinbase thought the wallet had been credited with additional ether, but checking the wallet outside of Coinbase showed that no deposit had occurred. VI Company uploaded screenshots of its transactions and outlined the simple steps to collecting all the ether you could ever spend: 1. Setup a smart contract with a few valid Coinbase wallets and [one] final faulty wallet 2. Transfer appropriate funds to smart contract 3. Execute smart contract adding the set amount of ether to the Coinbase wallets without ever actually leaving the smart contract wallet because the complete transaction fails at the last wallet 4. Repeat until you have more than enough ethereum in your Coinbase wallet. 5. Cash out Just to be clear, the Coinbase account would show the funds as being present even though they were never transferred to the wallets. So the “ether” that could be collected was just part of Coinbase’s records. A bad actor could then either transfer that out to a wallet not tied to Coinbase, or they could just convert that cryptocurrency to fiat money in a bank account. Had someone decided they wanted to millions of dollars worth of Ether, red flags surely would’ve gone up at Coinbase. And if they managed to transfer the money out, they’d still have to go through a laundering process. Coinbase is also pretty strict about verifying your real-world identity. We don’t know if anyone managed to game the system, but we’ve reached out to Coinbase for comment and will update this post when we receive a reply.

ADAM NAGOURNEY,"As the fires began, Mr. Garcetti, who has lived through his share of fires and earthquakes, sought to reassure a city watching the fast spread of out-of-control fires, whipped by Santa Ana winds and with the potential to inflict catastrophic damage across wide swaths of the city. “These are days that break your heart,” he said. “These are also days that show the resilience of our city.” By Thursday night, with the smoke cleared and most of the flames gone, Mr. Garcetti appeared visibly relieved over how Los Angeles had been, at least relatively, spared. This was hardly the most severe disaster California has endured — fires in other parts of the state were more challenging to their elected leaders — and if one believes the predictions of geologists, the worst may be yet to come. But it offered some insight into the style of this mayor, something of a test after six years in charge — and at a time when Mr. Garcetti has encouraged a bit of national attention by suggesting he may want to run for president. In Los Angeles, especially at moments like this, there are few jobs as critical as fire chief. And it was Ralph M. Terrazas, whom Mr. Garcetti promoted to fire chief soon after he became mayor, who appeared most at his side, offering technical updates on fire conditions and reports on how he was dispatching his 3,200-member force across this 500-square-mile city, where the speed of a response can determine whether a fire is a passing brusher or a conflagration that forces the evacuation of thousands of homes. At the height of the disaster, 900 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department were spread out across the region, fighting three major fires and battling back scores of other outbursts. They were among an army of 2,000 firefighters, many of whom had come in from across the state to assist in the effort. Six-hundred members of the city’s police department were also assigned to the fires. Raphael J. Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said that this episode had spotlighted, at least for now, the strong relationship Mr. Garcetti had with his police commissioner and the fire commissioner. Those relations have frequently been strained with mayors in the past, and that has caused problems when the city had to come together. “When the relationship between mayor and chief is toxic — think Bradley-Gates — it’s not good of either of them when disaster strikes,” Mr. Sonenshein said, referring to Tom Bradley, who was mayor of Los Angeles from 1973 to 1993, and Daryl Gates, his police commissioner. By the time Mr. Garcetti arrived on Thursday morning for a private briefing by fire and police officials at the command center for the Skirball Fire, the blaze — which at one point loomed as a potentially major threat to some of Los Angeles’ most affluent neighborhoods — was considered to be far less of a threat. But danger still loomed. The command post at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs campus, just off the 405 freeway, was bustling with firefighters and police officers. Mr. Garcetti, wearing a blue City Hall windbreaker emblazoned with his name, mingled with firefighters in front of the command post, comparing photographs of the fire on their phones and trading information on what they had heard in the field. Mr. Garcetti walked over to to a map of the fire taped onto the wall as an assistant chief, Corey Rose, brought him up-to-date. The the mayor dutifully scribbled notes, asking questions that reflected the decidedly technocratic spirit he has brought to City Hall. (Example: “What is the containment in Rye, do you know?” the mayor asked, inquiring about a fire in Santa Clarita.) The role of mayor in Los Angeles is almost vague by design, reflecting a cumbersome government system in Southern California that would seem to confound any attempt to manage a complicated crisis. There are 88 cities in Los Angeles County, with Los Angeles being the largest. The county is controlled by a five-member board of supervisors. That means, more often than not, that it is the mayor who becomes the face of a crisis. But the mayor doesn’t have the overall authority over the response. So when millions of Mr. Garcetti’s constituents were startled Wednesday night by their phones buzzing with an emergency alert warning of “extreme fire danger,” the mayor had nothing to do with it: That alert was sent out by the state. Not that he would have blocked it, Mr. Garcetti said. “I said overcommunicate,” he said. “You saw how many people died up north,” he added, referring to the Northern California fires in October. Mr. Garcetti has never been much of a showman, at least in the tradition of, say, Edward I. Koch or Rudolph W. Giuliani, two New York mayors who regularly became identified with the biggest crises of their cities. But when he turned up Tuesday morning for the first fire, he wore protective gear — the yellow jacket — and an official “mayor” firefighter’s helmet. That was out of necessity, he said later, recalling the embers raining down from the sky. In this mayor’s view, politicians in these kinds of settings should wear civilian clothes, and leave the uniforms to the officers. As he spoke, he picked up his firefighter helmet from the seat, and moved it to the back of the S.U.V.

Kristen V. Brown,"For the native species of New Zealand, European settlement was particularly cruel. The country has no endemic land predators, so many of its birds evolved without the typical avian aptitude for flight. Then came Western settlers, and along with them rats, mice, opossums, stoats, cats, and the occasional misbehaving dog. For these invaders, New Zealand’s flightless birds were a veritable feast. Numbers dwindled. Despite conservation efforts, the country still loses about 20 of its namesake kiwi birds every week. Then, in 2014, a young Harvard scientist published a paper that caught the attention of conservationists around the world, New Zealand included. Using the genetic engineering technique CRISPR, he suggested that scientists could create something called a gene drive to override natural selection’s typical 50-50 mix. Among other things, this technique might be used to engineer invasive pests to breed themselves out of existence. No kiwi-killing stoats. Presto. Earlier this year, typically GMO-wary New Zealand signaled it was interested in giving gene drives a whirl. Now, a pair of papers published Thursday suggest there’s just one potentially significant hitch: Gene drives do not appear to be safe to use for conservation—at least not yet. The problem, it turns out, is that gene drives might actually work a little too well. “Our models show that standard drive systems are highly invasive,” Kevin Esvelt, the synthetic biologist who published the original CRISPR gene drive paper back in 2014, told Gizmodo. Gene drives thwart natural selection by creating a “selfish gene” that gets passed down to offspring with more consistency than the rules of inheritance typically allow, eventually—in theory—spreading through an entire population. If New Zealand decided to use a gene drive to rid itself of rats, for example, it’s possible that those genetically altered rats would eventually make their way to other unintended locations, either by stowing away on ships like they did to get to New Zealand in the first place or by other humans not-so-keen on their own rat populations purposefully moving them. “[Modified organisms] probably can’t be safely tested in the field because they’re likely to spread to most populations of the target species throughout the world,” Esvelt said. As you might imagine, genetically altering the world’s entire rat population might wind up being a pretty big problem. “I badly misled many conservationists who are desperately in need of hope. My mistake was in miserably failing to communicate clearly.” The notion of using genetic engineering to thwart natural selection was first proposed in 2003, but it was with the advent of CRISPR and Esvelt’s 2014 paper that the prospect of gene drives seemed within the realm of possibility. The 2014 paper inspired a rush of enthusiasm and fear within the broader public, and spurred a heated debate within the scientific community about whether it would really work. Ever since first putting the idea out there, Esvelt has worked hard to warn the world just how dangerous it might be. He occupies a weird space: a scientist at the forefront of genetic engineering who is also probably the foremost critic of technology he creates. Esvelt, who now has his own lab at MIT, said that the pair of papers published Thursday— one in PLoS, the other as a preprint on bioRxiv —amount to a “ mea culpa ” of sorts. He said his original paper made a compelling case for all of the potential benefits of gene drives—conservation! eradicating disease!—without spelling out the risks and challenges clearly. New Zealand is not the first place to get excited about gene drives for conservation. In Hawaii, for one, the idea has been floated as a solution to the disease-carrying mosquitoes that threaten native bird populations. Last year, the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity concluded that the potential benefits are too great to not proceed with “carefully controlled field trials.” A report from the National Academies of Sciences gave a cautious go-ahead to gene drives as well. “I badly misled many conservationists who are desperately in need of hope,” Esvelt said. “My mistake was in miserably failing to communicate clearly.” Some recent research has suggested that wild populations will naturally develop resistance to lab-engineered modifications before a gene drive really has a chance to work its magic. In one 2015 study, researchers reported a CRISPR gene drive had allowed an infertility mutation in female mosquitoes to be passed on to all offspring, but as the mutation increased in frequency over several generations, resistance to the gene drive also emerged, making it unlikely for the mosquitoes to invade wild populations. But Esvelt has floated potential ways around this problem, such as inserting the gene drive gene at several important places in a species’ genome so that it’s unlikely to develop resistance. Even with an inefficient gene drive though, the bioRxiv paper suggests a model in which a small number of altered species could spread to unintended populations. “This is part of an ongoing conversation about the balances of risk and benefits of gene drive technology,” said Jason Delborne, a scientist who works on gene drives at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the recent work. “These new papers signal that we should be even more cautious about gene drive technology.” The PLoS paper, co-authored with New Zealand geneticist Neil Gemmell, warns that releasing a standard gene-drive is “likely equivalent to creating a new, highly invasive species.” In other words: It could be very, very bad. “There are these natural mutations that will cause gene drive to stop working, that’s true. But the reason we’re concerned is people are already figuring out solutions to those natural mutations,” Gemmell said. “If you do that, then how do you stop it?” Even experimenting in a contained lab could be dangerous. For example, if an engineered lab mouse escaped and that lab was in the vicinity of other mice it might breed with, the gene drive could spread accidentally. (An exception to all this, Esvelt said, might be engineering malaria-resistant mosquitoes, which most of the world might agree to even if there was a potential for the engineered mosquitoes to spread globally.) “As it stands, there’s still a very large gap in understanding between gene drives in the lab and gene drives in the field, and of course field trials are complicated by substantial ethical and political issues,” Gabriel Zentner, a scientist at Indiana University, told Gizmodo. “The article states that ‘now is the time to be bold in our caution,’ and I tend to agree.” “The tools we have right now are not optimal.” None of this means anyone is giving up hope on using gene drives as a tool for conservation. It’s just that excitement over the technology got a little ahead of the technology itself. Esvelt and other scientists are working on developing systems that could limit the spread of a gene drive. One potential solution, proposed by Esvelt, creates limits to the number of generations that inherit an engineered trait. Another being developed by a group called the Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodent’s Partnership seeks to find and target genetic sequences unique to a desired population so that the gene could not spread beyond it. The hope is that these new papers move more scientists to focus efforts on designing localized or self-limiting drives that might one day actually have real-world applications, rather than experiment with standard drives that might be too dangerous to ever deploy. “I think some of my colleagues think we just shot them in the foot. We’re still excited about what gene drive has to offer,” Gemmell said. “But the tools we have right now are not optimal. We need something you can turn on and off or has a finite life.” In New Zealand, the gene drive is being considered as part of a bold plan announced in 2015 by the New Zealand government to eradicate all wild predators by 2050. Gemmell is part of the team of scientists exploring the use of the technology in New Zealand, and he said the early research can still proceed as planned, alongside work to develop a safer gene drive. But, the PLoS paper points out, if any gene drive is ever to be deployed at all, transparent conversations about gene drive technology and its potential consequences need to happen with the public now. “This is a technology that socially and ethically we’re unprepared for, but technologically, we can do,” Gemmell said. “That’s disturbing. These conversations are overdue.” [ PLoS, bioRxiv ]","For the native species of New Zealand, European settlement was particularly cruel.

To make blazing past those pesky inhibitors possible, Decenturion is issuing 30,000,000 tokens ""tied to Ethereum."" And, as a super cheesy doom-and-gloom promotional video embedded below a countdown clock posits: ""what if the state pays its citizens, not the citizens pay the state."" Deep. My passport. Image: Jack Morse/mashable But even though all of the above sounds totally legit and normal, you might still want to slow your roll on applying for citizenship. The Decenturion booth at Consensus was staffed by a large group of people who, strangely enough, couldn't really provide any details on who is behind the project. Sure, one booth attendant told me that Singapore, Tokyo, and Paris are all possible sites for future embassies, but she definitely couldn't tell me anything else about the group's property buying plans. Another booth staffer mentioned that there are even moves to ""go to the UN,"" whatever that means. I asked one of the attendants about her connection to the company and she explained that she's a student in New York City and just started working for Decenturion on Monday of this week. Although ""working"" is perhaps the not the right word, as she claimed to be there in a ""volunteer"" capacity. Was John Galt a Bitcoin maximalist? Image: Jack Morse/mashable She further explained that another so-called volunteer trained her on the talking points, and that she had to sign an NDA. We reached out to the media email address provided, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, didn't hear back. A quick Whois lookup of the website shows that it was registered in January of this year and updated in May, but not much else. So what, really, is going on here?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The island chain of Socotra, famed for unique plants and animals found nowhere else on the planet, is coping with the aftermath of a powerful cyclone. The archipelago was struck by Cyclone Mekunu on Wednesday night, leaving at least 17 people missing and forcing its native population to flee floodwaters. Socotra is part of Yemen, which is embroiled in a lengthy civil war - something from which the four islands have largely been spared. But after two boats capsized during the cyclone, and at least three cars were washed away by powerful floods, the government has declared Socotra a disaster zone. Media caption Residents sought shelter from the knee-deep torrential floodwaters Coastal areas ""were submerged by floods causing heavy damage to homes,"" a spokesman told AFP. Hundreds have been evacuated from villages, but rescue workers are reportedly unable to reach many people in isolated parts of the main island. Officials have appealed to international aid agencies for help. Home of the blood dragon Socotra is famed for its natural beauty. Its startling biodiversity has earned it the nickname ""Galapagos of the Indian Ocean"" - a nod to Ecuador's famous Pacific island chain whose ecosystem is so unique it inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Image copyright Getty Images The link to the famed Galapagos is not purely marketing either. Since it was first surveyed by United Nations' biologists in 1997, Socotra has been considered one of the most biologically diverse and distinct places on Earth. It's estimated that 37% of its plants and 90% of its reptiles (along with almost all of its snails) are found nowhere else on earth, and the entire island chain is a registered Unesco World Heritage site. One of the most iconic of its native species is the blood dragon tree - a striking, umbrella-shaped tree with a thick trunk. Image copyright Getty Images It gets its name from the deep red sap within, which is gathered as a resin - and has a wide range of uses including as a dye, as incense, and in traditional medicine. Inaccessible island beauty The island's status as an ecological gem, however, has caused some problems for its residents. As its population battles the torrential floods left behind by Cyclone Mekunu, reaching those in need is a major problem - partly because Socotra has few roads stretching into its biodiversity areas. A 2007 travel article in the New York Times said a journey in a four-wheel-drive vehicle with an expert local driver as guide was ""a struggle to the death"", covering five miles in an hour and a half. It was, the author writes, worth it. But plans to build and expand access roads on Socotra's main island have been controversial for years. Unesco considers the building of roads in the protected areas ""a serious threat"" to the island's value, and no improvements have been made since 2010.

But some construction work is sorely needed - because this week's cyclone is the third in recent years. Chapala and Megh Two cyclones - the name given to hurricanes when they form in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans - battered Socotra in November 2015. Cyclone Chapala brought powerful winds similar to a category four hurricane, damaging homes, vehicles, and injuring dozens. Image copyright EPA Image caption Cyclone Chapala, seen from the International Space Station in 2015 Less than a week later, Cyclone Megh passed directly over the main island, triggering flash floods and killing another two people. Thousands were displaced from their homes. The damage was not limited to buildings and infrastructure. Soil erosion and habitat damage were also probable, and Unesco approved $75,000 (£56,000) in assistance last year to help mitigate the impact on threatened plants. Yemen's wider crisis Socotra remains under the control of the internationally-backed government, whose President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi is in exile in Saudi Arabia. His government called for all ""urgent aid"" possible for the people of Socotra. But the mainland continues to be plagued by a complex civil war involving several regional titans. The result is that mainland Yemen is suffering the worst humanitarian disaster on Earth, according to the United Nations. Since March 2015, 9,559 people have been killed and 55,616 injured in the conflict. The vast majority are men, but 791 children are reported among the dead - and the UN believes the actual numbers of the dead, including those not formally recorded, ""are likely to be much higher"". Cyclone Mekunu could hit the mainland this weekend near the border with neighbouring Oman, and could gain strength before making landfall.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has been known to offer help, from donating solar batteries to Puerto Rico to building a tiny ‘submarine’ to rescue that Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave. (It was never put to use.) The latest disaster to land on Musk’s radar? The water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The predominantly black city of Flint has been reeling from a manmade water crisis since 2014 when the city switched its water source, exposing everyone to lead-contaminated water. Twelve people died as a result of a Legionnaires outbreak from the same water source switch. Given how many times the state and city told residents the water was safe when it wasn’t, people have a hard time trusting their water even today. Now, Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, wants to help. He hopped on Twitter Wednesday to affirm his “commitment” to “fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination.” And the city’s mayor is ready to work with him. “This would be the first time for someone at [Musk’s] level to have taken interest in Flint and say, ‘I want to help,’” Mayor Karen Weaver told Earther. The mayor’s office told Earther it has been in touch with Musk’s team for preliminary conversations about what this partnership or donation or whatever Musk is offering could look like. Weaver said she still hasn’t gotten Musk on the phone, but the plan is for that to happen by Friday. “They’re interested in workforce development. They’re interested in environmental justice issues. That’s what makes it so exciting.” First on her agenda? To tell Musk what the city actually needs. Musk had tweeted about water filters, but the state already offers free filters to Flint residents. And Weaver said Musk’s team is listening, which is a good sign. If this billionaire wants to parachute into a complex environmental disaster, listening is an important first step. The mayor wouldn’t mind some help with Flint’s ongoing pipe replacement. The city currently plans to replace all its lead service pipes by 2019, a feat that is expected to cost nearly $200 million (which the city is funding through a legal settlement and with state and federal help). “If we could finish that sooner, that would be a wonderful thing,” Weaver said. “This year would be great!” That’s one potential avenue. Economic development is another. Growing economic opportunities in this city, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line, would immensely aid its recovery, Weaver said. The mayor hopes their conversation will include opportunities in tech, given Musk’s role in the sector. Her conversation with his team didn’t shy away from that option. “They’re interested in tech,” she said. “They’re interested in workforce development. They’re interested in environmental justice issues. That’s what makes it so exciting.” Weaver isn’t worried about a private entity intervening in public affairs: After all, the city’s accepted donations from major companies ( like Nestlé ) and celebrities ( like Will Smith ) before. But Musk’s enthusiasm has been known to lead to disappointment or, well, nothing at all, from failed projections for his auto company to a so-called self-sustaining city on Mars that still lacks solid plans. So until we see some results, Musk’s newfound commitment to solving Flint’s water crisis should be met with some skepticism. Seems like Michigan learned its lesson on lead exposure after what happened in the city of Flint.… Read more Read Ultimately, trust lies at the heart of what’s going on in Flint. Residents are slowly regaining trust in city officials, Weaver said, but they’ve lost faith in the state of Michigan. Especially after it ended a free water bottle distribution program in April. The mayor doesn’t advise any of her constituents to drink the tap water, and she even seems wary about filtered water. “I use filtered water, as well, but most of the time, I’m using bottled water,” Weaver said.","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has been known to offer help, from donating solar batteries to Puerto Rico to building a tiny ‘submarine’ to rescue that Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave.

Tom McKay,"A Japanese nuclear power station in Hokkaido is operating on emergency power after the region was hit by a 6.7-magnitude quake in the early hours of Thursday morning, Reuters reported. However, though the event carries unsettling overtones of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, authorities say there is currently no danger of any similar radioactive release occurring. 100 people are injured and 19 missing following the quake on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK. The seismic event knocked out local power, forcing Hokkaido Electric Power’s Tomari nuclear plant to switch to emergency generators to keep its three reactors from overloading. Reuters wrote: The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. The Fukushima incident occurred after an earthquake off the coast of Tōhoku prefecture on Honshu, Japan’s largest island, caused a tsunami. The disaster killed some 19,000 people, as well as knocked out power to and swamped backup generators at the Fukushima facility. The result was three nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen-air explosions that spread a radioactive plume up to 25 miles away, as well as resulted in authorities dumping massive amounts of contaminated material into the oceans. Scientists say most of that radiation quickly faded or was otherwise diluted. Most, but not all, also agree that there is likely a low risk to public health outside of the immediate region of the plant. The primary danger is to the thousands of workers involved in its cleanup. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported, the Japanese government acknowledged the first death of a worker from radiation exposure at the plant, a subcontractor for its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company that developed lung cancer in 2016. Japan idled all of its 54 nuclear power facilities after the incident, but seven have since been reactivated “after a protracted relicensing process,” Reuters wrote. The Conversation wrote last year that the Japanese government estimated the total cost of the Fukushima at around $188 billion, while polls indicated the Japanese public had lost faith in the safety of nuclear power. The cleanup effort at the facility still generates huge amounts of nuclear waste, and Tokyo Electric doesn’t expect to begin clearing fuel debris from the destroyed reactor cores until into the next decade. According to Reuters, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that he is coordinating emergency response for the earthquake on Thursday. A government spokesman added that a Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing plant in the city of Muroran also caught fire, but is being brought under control.

JONATHAN MARTIN,"Many California Republicans also believe the open primary law, which was adopted in a 2010 referendum, has proved to be a political science experiment gone terribly awry. “I hate the top-two,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and California’s most prominent Republican. In the tradition of many reforms enacted by voters in the state that helped pioneer direct democracy, the move to do away with partisan primaries has triggered a host of unforeseen consequences. “It has created mass confusion,” said Dave Gilliard, a longtime Republican strategist here. “And the people who have been empowered are not people from the districts. It has really just increased the power of outside forces.” It is, however, the people from the districts who are the most frustrated.

AJ Dellinger,"Here’s a fun thing to think about as you plan your next vacation: researchers at a number of government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security believe that a cyberattack against an airplane is inevitable and could lead to a “catastrophic disaster.” Have a nice trip! Motherboard got its hands on a number of government documents via Freedom of Information Act request, which yielded internal presentations and risk assessments from DHS. The agency has been looking into potential vulnerabilities in commercial aircraft and found that most planes lack necessary cybersecurity protections, which is not reassuring. A portion of the documents come from a presentation put together by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a research group that is part of the Department of Energy. The lab conducted tests earlier this year in which it attempted hack an aircraft via its wifi internet service. The presentation, dated January 10, 2018, seems to suggest PNNL succeeded in part, noting that researchers were able to “establish actionable and unauthorized presence on one or more onboard systems.” However, another slide noted the group was “unable to penetrate via selected access vector,” leaving it unclear just how successful the simulated attack was. What the research does make clear is the fact that they view a potential hack of an airplane as a viable threat and one that should be taken seriously. “Potential of catastrophic disaster is inherently greater in an airborne vehicle,” part of the presentation said. Another troubling part claims that it’s just “a matter of time before a cyber security breach on an airline occurs,” the document adds. While the PNNL documents come from earlier this year, DHS has been probing the possibility of a cyberattack against commercial airplanes for some time now. A document from 2017 reported that “early testing indicates that viable attack vectors exist that could impact flight operations.” A team of researchers at the agency reportedly successfully hacked the electronics systems of a commercial aircraft last year, bolstering concerns that malicious actors could make planes a target for attack. Making the situation all the more worrisome is that DHS stated in a 2016 presentation that “most commercial aircraft currently in use have little to no cyber protections in place.” Per the presentation, most current aircraft have about a 20-year or longer lifecycle, which means “15-20 years of higher cyber vulnerability.” That is a significant period of time to rely on the existing cybersecurity protections on planes, which the DHS describes as “a network of trust,” suggesting companies are basically just banking on the idea that they won’t get hacked. DHS also warned in a presentation that it expects “significant reluctance by the commercial world to expend resources” to prevent cyberattacks. (Boeing, in a statement to Motherboard, said it is “confident in the cyber-security measures of its airplanes.”) If a hack were to occur, it could spell a considerable amount of trouble for the industry. Not only could it do damage to the plane itself, but DHS warns that it could “create conditions where public perceives there is risk to aircraft operations.” The agency also raises the possibility of a hack causing a disruption to the operation of commercial and military flights and could have a significant economic impact on plane manufacturers. In a statement to Motherboard, DHS said it “takes aviation cybersecurity seriously” and is working with researchers and vendors to “identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the aviation sector.” One document notes the agency has moved from penetration testing to mitigation development last year, suggesting it is helping companies develop defenses against attacks. The spokesperson for DHS also noted, “The aviation industry, including manufacturers and airlines, has invested heavily in cybersecurity and built robust testing and maintenance procedures to manage risks.” [ Motherboard ]",Here’s a fun thing to think about as you plan your next vacation: researchers at a number of government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security believe that a cyberattack against an airplane is inevitable and could lead to a “catastrophic disas…,2018-06-07T03:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Government Researchers Say It's Only a 'Matter of Time' Until a Commercial Airline is Hacked,https://gizmodo.com/government-researchers-say-its-only-a-matter-of-time-un-1826623974,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uoIqOc1V--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/qdednjn8i1qe8huas8f9.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,disaster,1

Rhett Jones,"Verizon recently started offering a VPN service to make users feel more secure when connecting to public wi-fi, but the premium feature’s associated privacy policy is a disaster. The company is reportedly trying to fix it and says the whole thing was just a mistake. The age of the privacy grift is upon us. Over the last couple of years, the public has become more aware of massive data collection by corporations and the steady drumbeat of leaks and hacks of personal information has people looking for a quick fix. If you ever find yourself tuned into Fox News, you’ll see commercials advertising dubious VPN services claiming to anonymize your online activities crammed between spots for buying gold and penis pills. That’s why many people might see a VPN option offered by their wireless carrier and consider it a simple solution to a problem they’re vaguely aware of. This is a bad idea. Case in point, Verizon’s “ Safe Wi-Fi ” plan offers users “a VPN which protects your privacy when you use public Wi-Fi, so you can connect confidently and securely” for the low cost of $3.99 per month. As Motherboard first reported, it appears the service is a privacy problem itself. The Safe Wi-Fi terms of service on Verizon’s website offers little explanation and encourages users to read the privacy policy on McAfee’s website “carefully and completely.” If you make it that far, you’ll find the sentence, “We may use Personal Data for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Data or with your consent.” That gives McAfee a lot of room to collect, use, and share your data. The policy goes on to outline more ways that your personal data could be used, all under the caveat that McAfee will “generally” disclose how it uses that information before it does anything. When we contacted Verizon about the issue, a spokesperson told us that a mistake was made and McAfee’s website only has its standard generic privacy policy posted at the moment. “We’re working with McAfee to post their privacy policy specific to Safe WiFi,” the spokesperson said. They added that “it will reflect the fact that neither Verizon nor McAfee collects any personal data regarding users or [their] use of the Safe WiFi VPN.” We’ll update this post when we receive a link to the revised policy. Assuming Verizon is being forthcoming, it gives little comfort to know that Motherboard had to inform the company of what its publicly posted policy actually said. The thing is, Verizon is the kind of company you want to protect yourself from if you’re concerned enough about privacy to be using a mobile VPN. The big stories that circulate in the media about reckless privacy standards are more often than not about big companies like Verizon, Facebook, and Equifax being data-hungry money machines. Facebook has also offered its own suspect VPN service that you should definitely not use. You can read up on what you should look for in a VPN here, but different services can change and you should always do some research before using one. Even if this VPN is the greatest service in its field, do you really want to add to the heap of little fees that Verizon turns into big money?

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding Californias Camp Fire was the worlds costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that poor forest management is to blame for Californias wildfires woes. He also again threatened to cut off FEMA aid to the state.
The news was announced this morning on Trumps communication platform of choice, in a typo-laden tweet that has since been taken down and rewritten with the standard English spelling of forest.
Heres the original:
The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.
We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives, Newsom tweeted in response to Trumps threat.","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding California’s Camp Fire was the world’s costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that “poor forest management” is to bla…",2019-01-09T19:24:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","Trump Threatens to Cut off Federal Wildfire Aid to California in Ill-Informed, Typo-Laden Tweet",https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-threatens-to-cut-off-federal-wildfire-aid-to-cali-1831610415,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--w9hzFmmX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/yyyonpdq0czaryx3ybex.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,disaster,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions. The multibillion disaster centered in Nebraska will spread this spring, with above average rainfall expected to cause floods to impact some 200 million Americans living near rivers. And it wont necessarily end once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
This springs floods will shape this summers dead zone. The area of low oxygen is an annual occurrence driven in large part by nutrient-laden runoff that washes down the Mississippi River and its many tributaries, fueling algae blooms when it reaches the Gulf. The dead zone in 2017 was the largest thats ever been recorded at nearly 9,000 square miles, and while its much too early to say exactly how big this summers dead zone will be, the flooding weve seen so far doesnt bode well. Another enormous dead zone would put pressure on Gulf marine life and fisheries
The flooding we see this month, in March, may ultimately determine the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone in August, Kimberly Van Meter, a researcher who studies water and ecosystems at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Earther.
And this years floods are already shaping up to record setting. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the upper Mississippi and Red River of the North basins have doubled their normal spring rainfall totals. That includes areas that were smacked by a rare bomb cyclone earlier this month that dumped rain on snow and set the flooding overtaking the region in motion. NOAA forecasts indicate areas all along the Mississippi River basin could face major flooding through Mayas snow continues to melt amid a forecast for heavier than normal rainfall over the next few months.
As the floodwater wash over farmers fields, theyll do more than strip soil. They can also scoop up fertilizer and other organic matter and transport it downriver. The nutrient-rich water will reach the Gulf of Mexico sometime in June, which will kickstart the dead zone.
In the simplest terms, the more nitrate that is transported downstream to the Gulf, the larger the size of the dead zone, Van Meter said. Nitrate is food for algae, and spring floods essentially deliver a large, delicious meal to the Gulf just as temperatures start to rise and the algae start to grow. Decades of fertilizer application and intensive livestock production across the Mississippi River Basin have created large stores of nitrate in the landscape, just waiting for the next flood to carry them to the Gulf.
As that algae bloom grows, it hoovers up all the oxygen that marine life needs to survive. The process is known as hypoxia, and chokes marine life to death. But they also take a toll on humans as well. Separate algae blooms in Lake Erie have befouled drinking water. Those along Floridas coasts have harmed the tourism industry. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone creates its own hardships.
Weve got data that its essentially a doughnut hole that forms with brown shrimp where they are avoiding areas that are low oxygen and theyre congregating on the edge, David Kidwell, a researcher at NOAAs National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, told Earther.
Recent NOAA-funded research has shown that the dead zone can cause small and large shrimp prices to fluctuate, with fishermen catching fewer high-value large shrimp when a dead zone is present. Climate change is liable to make blooms worse by intensifying the hydrological cycle and warming waters. Whether the historic flooding that just hit the Midwest leads to a historic dead zone is not set in stone, though. 
Kidwell said that the annual dead zone forecast NOAA and the U.S. Geological Service puts out in early summer is based in large part on discharge of the Mississippi River as well as the pure nutrient levels in the river at that time, but other factors could dull their impact. A hurricanewhich would offer its own set of problemscould churn up the Gulf and staunch the algae bloom.
Regardless of what happens this season, its clear that something has to change in how we manage land and floodwaters. Nancy Rabalais, a marine ecologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, told Earther that it does not make sense is to rebuild in floodplains if the end goal is to limit the Gulf dead zone (to say nothing of exposing communities upstream to floodwaters). Reducing the amount of farmland in the floodplain so would ultimately cut down on fertilizer and animal waste being swept into streams and eventually the Gulf. Rabalais said, though, that she knew what this means economically to the agriculture community if floodplains were put off limits.
That neatly illustrates the tradeoffs and hard discussions society will be forced to havefarmers or fishermen? Midwest or Gulf Coast?the longer we put off addressing climate change, which is set to make heavy downpours and flooding even worse. Starting those conversations now makes a lot more sense than, say, holding sham votes.","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions.

Dozens of people died and hundreds are still missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in Brazil. 
The rupture released a sea of contaminated muddy sludge, in some places up to 15m (50ft) deep, sliding towards the town of Brumadinho, eventually covering an area the size of 300 football pitches. 
The mud buried the dam site's cafeteria, where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads.
As hopes of finding anyone alive dwindle, thoughts are now turning to how to deal with the 12 million cubic metres of mud that was released. 
Built in 1976, the dam was used to hold residue from the mine, which it is feared may contain harmful chemical substances.
So, how will it be cleared up and how could the operation be guided by lessons from past disasters?
Before and after photos show the vast scale of the destruction caused by the sliding mud.
Vale, the mining company responsible for the dam, has announced plans to deal with the debris. 
These include building barriers to contain the mud in the area around the dam, dredging a section of the nearby river and constructing barriers to sift out the fine residue.
This case is especially sensitive because of the number of bodies thought to be buried by the mudslide. 
""It isn't just mud there, it's people's families. Everything will depend on how rescue efforts go. And it will take a long time,"" says Anderson Amparo, from Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama), which, along with other agencies, is responsible for determining what to do with the waste.
And he says even if the authorities were certain that there were no more bodies in the mud, it would not necessarily be cleared in its entirety. 
""In some areas it is best to plant over the land to restore it to its original use, whether it be agriculture or forest,"" Mr Amparo says.

 Experts are concerned the collapsed dam released harmful substances
Miguel Felippe, a professor of geoscience at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, disagrees. Although it is not yet clear if the mud in Brumadinho is toxic, he says some environmental damage is to be expected. 
""This debris is very likely to contain harmful chemical substances,"" he says.
""Even if there are no traces of heavy metals, which are the most worrisome, like arsenic, there are others which are sure to be there and will float downstream, as the mud has already reached a river, so, environmentally speaking, it would be best to remove the material.""
Vale says an analysis is under way and the results are expected within the next two weeks but it is too soon to say for sure that the mud is toxic. 
The mine waste, known as tailings, may contain traces of nickel, magnesium, cadmium, iron oxide, ammonia, silica, silt, clay, mercury and arsenic, says Bráulio Magalhães Fonseca, a geologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. 
And experts say the level of toxicity will depend on the concentration of each substance.
Roger Doome, director general of the Industrial Minerals Association Europe, in Brussels, says that implementing an appropriate clean-up response depends on assessing the specific type of contamination. 
If that can't be removed, it needs to be neutralised, he says.
""And if the elements are flowing down the river, it is almost impossible [to avoid contamination].""
Different cleaning techniques will need to be applied to different types of mud. 
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Hundreds of people are still missing
Prof Felippe says the top layer of mud could be removed through dredging or using excavators. 
""As you get closer to the soil, more sophisticated technology is required because heavy machinery may damage the soil, exposing it to erosive processes,"" he says.
Brazil went through a similar tragedy in 2015, in what was considered to be the country's worst environmental disaster. 
A dam burst in the nearby town of Mariana, also owned by Vale, in partnership with BHP Billiton, releasing 43.7 million cubic meters of mining waste and killing 19 people. 
Most of that waste - about 90%, according to the environment agency - was never removed.
That disaster led to a public campaign to introduce tough legislation on the mining industry. 
But campaigners were disappointed by the regulations eventually passed, saying they failed to address their demands for stricter safety measures.
They had also called for a ban on the type of dam involved in the Brumadinho disaster. 
Lessons from Europe?
Mr Doome recalls two accidents he says set a precedent for how the mining industry in Europe responds to accidents where dangerous substances are involved. 
In April 1998, a dam burst in Aznalcóllar, Spain, releasing almost seven million cubic meters of mine tailings. 
The acidic mud and water were tainted with heavy metals and travelled for over 40km (25 miles) down the Guadiamar river, contaminating 4,500 hectares (17 sq miles) of land on the Doñana National Park, a Unesco world heritage site. 
The clean-up operation took over three years and cost 240m euros (£210m), according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.
In 2000, tragedy hit the Romanian town of Baia Mare. A dam partially collapsed, releasing about 100,000 cubic metres of water contaminated with cyanide. The water ran down streams towards the Tisza river, reaching the Danube and the Black Sea. 
""Since those tragedies, we have adapted European legislation so that now we have a strict action plan and legal requirements,"" Mr Doome says.
""For instance, if we assess that there is a minor risk [of spilling], by law we have the obligation to provide an emergency plan, internal and external. 
""The plan must be ready and in place even before the mine starts operating.""
The Brumadinho dam had passed safety inspections. Five people involved in the inspections have been arrested as part of an investigation to find out whether the process was fraudulent.

Matt Petronzio,"Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water. The new TV spots, from the brewer's popular brands Budweiser and Stella Artois, both focus on the need for clean water in different parts of the world. It's undoubtedly an effort by Anheuser-Busch to show off its accomplishments in corporate social responsibility, but it's also an example of trends in Super Bowl ad spend toward promoting good causes, rather than simply trying to sell products. And this year, these ads could spread some much-needed awareness. SEE ALSO: How Apple, Anheuser-Busch, and other companies are helping Harvey victims The Super Bowl has long offered the best TV ad real estate of the year. More than 112 million people are expected to watch the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots on Sunday, with coveted advertising spots costing "" north of $5 million "" for 30 seconds. That's a lot of eyes, which is why ""Stand By You"" — the one-minute, heartwarming Budweiser ad that stops just short of being emotionally overwrought — is an important use of airtime. It shows Kevin Fahrenkrog, general manager of Anheuser-Busch's Cartersville, Georgia, brewery, waking up in the middle of the night to lead emergency operations during a natural disaster. We see the brewery switch gears; beer cans are filled with water for people in need, while singer-songwriter Skylar Grey's crooning cover of Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"" plays in the background. As Budweiser tractor-trailers set out to deliver the cans, the words ""TEXAS,"" ""FLORIDA,"" ""PUERTO RICO,"" and ""CALIFORNIA"" flash across the screen. ""Stand By You"" hits close to home, after Americans witnessed one catastrophic natural disaster after another in 2017, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, and the Northern California wildfires. SEE ALSO: Anheuser-Busch brewery halts beer to bottle water for flood victims But the ad also highlights something that many people — and perhaps the average Super Bowl viewer — may not know. In partnership with the American Red Cross, Anheuser-Busch has used its Cartersville brewery to deliver clean drinking water to disaster victims and communities in need for nearly 30 years. In that time, the emergency water program has provided more than 79 million cans of water across the country. Last year alone, Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross delivered 2 million cans of water to people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and California. There’s no bigger stage than #SBLII to recognize our real life heroes. Our Cartersville, GA employees and wholesaler partners have helped provide 79 million+ cans of emergency drinking water since 1988. Cheers to them, and to expanding this program in 2018. https://t.co/HjCZA6HNLU https://t.co/uvljAOBade — Anheuser-Busch (@AnheuserBusch) January 26, 2018 The commercial primarily celebrates Anheuser-Busch's efforts, sure. But it also hopefully reminds the millions of people watching the Super Bowl (and other powerful corporations) of the importance of disaster relief at all levels. It should also serve as a reminder that communities are still in need of assistance. One-third of Puerto Rico residents, for example, are still living without electricity and, in some areas, without running water. ""We believe we can make an even greater impact."" A huge conglomerate like Anheuser-Busch halting beer production at one of its locations to help those in need is admirable, but it's also strategically difficult for one brewery in Georgia to serve everyone across the country. That's why Anheuser-Busch just announced it would be converting another brewery into an emergency water response location in 2018. The brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, will be able to fill cans with water, helping Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross to reach more people on the West Coast in shorter amounts of time. ""Anheuser-Busch has a long history of giving back, and not only are we continuing to support in the short-term, but we also want to use our upcoming 30th anniversary of the emergency water program to announce our long-term commitment for natural disaster relief,"" said Bill Bradley, vice president of community affairs at Anheuser-Busch, in a statement. ""By adding our Fort Collins, Colorado, brewery to the program, we believe we can make an even greater impact,"" he said. ""Taps,"" the 30-second Stella Artois ad featuring Matt Damon, shifts the focus to developing countries. In partnership with Water.org, the water and sanitation organization Damon cofounded in 2009, the campaign encourages beer lovers to ""Make Your Super Bowl Party Matter"" and help end the global water crisis affecting more than 663 million around the world. ""Such a simple thing,"" Damon says in the spot. ""Clean water at the turn of a tap. It's like magic. It takes no time at all. And yet millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" ""Millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" It's a worthy cause, and could change some American viewers' perceptions about global haves and have-nots. But the ad is more transparent in selling a product than Budweiser, driving viewers to buy a $13 chalice, with $3.13 of each purchase going toward Water.org's efforts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. That's less than 25 percent of each chalice going to clean water initiatives — but Damon does make a decent point: ""If just 1 percent of you watching this buys one, we could give clean water to 1 million people for five years,"" he says in the ad. Proceeds from other Stella Artois purchases will benefit clean water efforts, too — the campaign claims the purchase of a 12-pack will provide clean water to someone for 12 months. (A portion of proceeds from the Budweiser ad's ""Stand By Me"" single will also be directly donated to the American Red Cross.) These aren't the first socially conscious Super Bowl ads by a long shot. Notable recent examples include the powerful 2016 ad from anti-domestic violence organization NO MORE, and Colgate's recurring campaign to get Americans to use less water when they brush their teeth. In 2017, several ads seemed to comment on issues like immigration and the Trump administration, though many marketing teams (of course) claimed any political statements were unintentional. Whether a Super Bowl ad is a well-done, altruistic campaign or a transparent, capitalist gimmick (or some unintended statement in between), the big game continues to offer the perfect time to send a message directly into millions of Americans' homes. There are already predictions that most of Super Bowl LII's ads will focus more on humor than politics or social issues this year, but the potential for social impact remains huge.","Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters. While it was still assessing the fallout from Augusts deadly Lombok earthquake, a major earthquake on September 28 triggered a tsunami that slammed into Central Sulawesi. According to the latest UN reports, this disaster robbed at least 2,010 people of their lives, with 700 still reported missing. The tragedy in Sulawesi may be falling out of the news cycle, but the recovery efforts there are now in full swing. For emergency responders, the hard work of getting supplies, shelter, healthcare and education to those in need is just beginning. It hasnt been easy. The population is in shock, to be quite frank, Susan Mangicaro, the Indonesia response management team leader at International Medical Corps, told Earther. The quake, tsunami and associated landslides in late September destroyed or severely damaged 67,000 homes, leaving 330,000 people without proper shelters. Marc Vergara, chief of communications for UNICEF, said that entire neighborhoods in Central Sulawesi have simply vanished, literally erased from the map. Tens of thousands of displaced people are being packed into temporary emergency shelters where limited aid can be administered. State officials with Indonesias national disaster management authority (BNPB) and the military are leading the recovery efforts. Right now, those officials are still working out what type of aid needs prioritizing and who might be best placed to help hand it out. Meanwhile, international NGOs and local partners that have received permission to work alongside the BNPB are working round the clock to fill in the gaps and do what they can. Maya Kroitoru, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee s director of operations for disaster relief and development, told Earther that upon arrival in Sulawesi in the days following the tsunami, the scene was desperate and grim. The population is in shock. She described how people lacking food and water plundered aid trucks, how the bodies of the dead were still scattered along the road, and how her team of aid workers waited in line for seven hours to enter the city of Palu where the full force of the tsunami struck. She described the city as paralyzed. Several weeks later, getting help to the afflicted sites is still proving immensely difficult. The airport at Palu was extensively damaged, and roads leading to the city are covered in mudslides. Journeys that should take 8-10 hours are taking 20-25 instead, according to Mangicaro. The dire situation has been exacerbated by heavy disruption to the regions already sub-standard infrastructure. Water and sewerage systems have been knocked out completely in tsunami-hit Palu and Donggala. In plenty of regions, electricity is down and cell phone communications are been extremely limited. The main priorities for all actors on the ground is to prevent further emergencies from happening, Daniel von Rège, the Doctors Without Borders country director for Indonesia, told Earther. Here were talking about mainly reducing the spread of diseases linked to lack of clean water for drinking, washing and cooking. Electrical generators, water purification kits, health servicesboth mental and physicaland the management of vector-borne diseases are at the top of the list. Vergara said that food is now somewhat less of a problem that it was in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, although various aid agencies have said that there are still reports of communities being cut off from basic supplies. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education to get kids back to school as quickly as possibleno easy feat after 2,700 schools were damaged. The plan is to set up temporary tent classrooms while training teachers to cater to the children who need their education to continue. Education is a tool for recovery, Vergara said, adding that restoring a sense of normalcy is important. This is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that many residents are now afraid of being so close to the sea. The ocean isnt all they have to fear. During disasters like these, crime rates also rise, exacerbated by the willful spread of hoaxes and misinformation. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gender-based violence can rise following natural disasters, too. And a high number of children have been separated from their families, placing them at risk of sexual exploitation, violence and trafficking. So far, working alongside the Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF has helped to identify 61 such children, and three have been reunited with their parents. Sadly, many are feared to have been orphaned. As is always the case, these disasters didnt affect everyone equally. It is the very vulnerable and poor who are most in danger when these disasters strike, Kroitoru said. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone. Plenty of NGOs hire local staff, as they know the affected population, language, customs and culture best. Sadly, some of those local aid workers have been swept up in the disaster too. Mangicaro of International Medical Corps said that one of their in-country aid workers homes was destroyed by the tsunami, but that he and his family were physically unharmed. Immediately after the disaster struck, he began an on-site assessment, even though he had to sleep outside. Its not clear how long recovery will take. Lessons can be drawn from the past disasterslike the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people across 14 countriesbut only to a certain extent. No two disasters are exactly alike. Despite the unknowns, first responders do know that certain things must always be done after a disaster strikes. Building resilience is vital. Training, education and assisting the local population is the best way you can help out, Mangicaro explained. Indeed, although theres a debate as to what extent Indonesias current early warning system may have failed and contributed to the crisis, seismologists have stressed that plays second fiddle to public awareness of natural hazards. Effective safety advice, tailored to the regions specific geology and society, needs to be properly disseminated through community-driven initiatives. Long term, infrastructural reconstruction and restoration will also be vital. In an ideal world, earthquake-proof building codes would be applied and reinforced, and tsunami barriers would be set up in vulnerable areas. This, however, depends entirely on resource availability and the governments willingness to act, both of which are lacking at present in Indonesia. Kroitoru explained that its critical for everyone to understand that the emergency does not end when the headlines recede. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone, Vergara said. Practical help is required for communities in Sulawesi, but they also value dignity and emotional support too.","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami. More than 1,200 deaths have been confirmed, and the city of Palu needs help. There are a number of ways to donate, but according to the New York Times, money is a much more immediate way to help rather than canned goods, water, or clothes. Its very easy for those items to be misplaced. NPR reports that the scale of the disaster was at first difficult to determine, because communications were knocked out. The U.N. is now estimating that 1.6 million have been or will be affected in the coming recovery. The NYT and NPR suggest ed a number of organizations you can send money to who have people on the ground (to make sure it gets where it needs to go). GlobalGiving This group focuses on local organizations and currently have a goal of $1 million to help people in Sulawesi. They focus on emergency supplies first, then long-term recovery assistance. CARE CARE is also focusing on immediate needs north of Palu and towards the center of the cityespecially clean drink water, sanitation and shelter.Their county director in Indonesia, Helen Vanwel, told NPR that its a difficult project, because access is limited. A landslide has blocked the main road into Palu, flights are restricted into the airport, there is a destruction of major seaports and a general lack of communication, she said. Indonesian Red Cross According to the group, theyve mobilized 70 tons of supplies, including baby kits, mattresses and tents as well as water trucks and 15 ambulances. They say they have 179 staffers in the area already. Humanity &amp; Inclusion This organization has been in Indonesia since 2005. The theme continues to be working on immediate relief, especially medical care and psychosocial support. Save the Children There are Save the Children volunteers in Palu who are trying to establish temporary shelters from ropes and tarps, and also clearing away areas for children to safely play, because kids continue to need some normalcy and freedom when their worlds are turned upside down. UNICEF This group is also working on clean water by bringing in a mobile water treatment facility. Theyve also been working with local authorities to find the families of children who were separated from them during the disaster. The Jakarta Post also shared a few groups that are much more local, and shared a message from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying things like fuel (diesel fuel and gasoline), drinking water, medical personnel, medicines and field hospitals, tents, tarps, blankets, stretchers, water tanks, food, lamps, generator sets, emergency kitchens, body bags, shrouds and baby food were all needed. They also boosted the Indonesian Red Cross as an option for immediate relief. Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT Indonesia) ACT Indonesia as been around since 2005 as well, and are extremely transparent with their money.

Hayato Huseman,"The Find X feels like a direct response from OPPO to all of the jaded critics that love to say that smartphone designs have become ""boring"" or ""iterative."" It's hard to call this phone either of those things, with its incredibly unique slide-out camera panel and jaw-dropping bezel-less display. From a hardware perspective, this is probably the most interesting phone of the year, and maybe even a milestone for smartphones as a whole. As with any industry-leading design, though, the phone isn't perfect, and that's before you even turn it on. Once you do, the Find X's software isn't nearly as futuristic as its hardware, and some of the ways OPPO changes the fundamental Android experience with ColorOS are hard to look past. Price: $960 Bottom line: The Find X has a jaw-dropping, innovative design and an almost entirely bezel-less display, but the ColorOS software is pretty hard to look past and its cameras are subpar for the price. Pros: Gorgeous, unique design with high screen-to-body ratio Long-lasting battery Huge, bright display Cons: ColorOS is a travesty Notifications are disabled on most apps by default Cameras aren't great for the money No water resistance or wireless charging About this review I (Hayato Huseman) am writing this review after using the Find X (PAFM00) for two weeks in Indianapolis and New York City on the AT&amp;T network. The phone was running firmware version PAFM00_11_A.23_7cd29206 with ColorOS v5.1 based on Android 8.1 Oreo, and hasn't received any updates over the course of the review. The unit was purchased by Mobile Nations. OPPO Find X Hardware The Find X is one of the most unique phones I've ever used from a hardware perspective. There's just nothing like it, and that starts with its curved 6.4-inch display, front and center. It's a great Full HD+ AMOLED panel with good color reproduction and outdoor viewing angles, but that's clearly not its headline characteristic. The display occupies an insane 93.8% of the face of the phone. Read that back, that's just a few points shy of a completely bezel-less, 100% screen-to-body ratio. That absolutely topples over phones like the Galaxy Note 9, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, and even the Vivo NEX — the latter of which is closest in design to the Find X. While having virtually nothing but screen up front isn't always entirely practical (we'll get to that later), watching videos on this phone is nothing short of stunning, and it's an experience unlike using any other phone. The biggest problem with the coveted bezel-less design tech enthusiasts lust over is that phones still need somewhere to put all of the various sensors that typically sit above the display — things like the ambient light and proximity sensors, the earpiece speaker, and the front-facing camera. Most manufacturers have started cramming those sensors into a notch at the top of the display, but OPPO had something different in mind. The Find X's motorized camera panel is a stunning hardware component, but moving parts still give me pause. At the top of the Find X is a motorized hidden panel that raises whenever you need to access the cameras and automatically tucks itself away when you're done. It's just as crazy as it sounds; you can actually hear and feel the motors whirring as the panel raises and lowers, and it's just wild to watch. While the Vivo NEX pulled off a similar design first with its motorized camera tab, this is the first phone with a raising panel spanning the entire width of the phone. Now if you're worried about hardware longevity with a motorized panel … well, you're right to be. OPPO says it's tested its motor for up to 300,000 actuations, but at the end of the day it's still a moving part, and moving parts eventually break. If that happens with the Find X, you're not just out a cool party trick, you won't be able to access your cameras. That's not just a big deal for photographers, either. Since the Find X doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, it instead relies on facial recognition for authentication. Just like the iPhone X, when you first set up the phone, it uses infrared to map out your face, including depth, then the panel quickly slides out to read your face every time you turn on the display. The whole system works surprisingly well; the motor is fairly quick to extend and retract the panel as necessary, and the facial recognition is almost instant once the panel is out. The process isn't quite as fast as OnePlus's facial recognition or even Apple's Face ID, but we're talking a second longer at most — this is perfectly fine for daily use. Just like the alternatives, the Find X won't unlock if you're looking away, which is a good security measure. The only time the phone gives me any trouble is when I'm wearing glasses; it'll still recognize me eventually, but it often takes much longer than usual. Specs OPPO Find X Screen 6.4-inch 19.5:9 (2340x1080) AMOLED Chipset Snapdragon 845 RAM 8GB Storage 128GB/256GB Software Android 8.1 Oreo, ColorOS 5.1 Rear Camera 1 16MP, ƒ/2.0 Rear Camera 2 20MP, ƒ/2.0 Front Camera 25MP, ƒ/2.0 Security Face unlock Battery 3730mAh Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.0 Colors Bordeaux Red, Glacier Blue Dimensions 156.7 x 74.2 x 9.6mm Weight 186g Price $960 It's almost a shame how much the motorized panel and bezel-less display steer the conversation away from the rest of the phone, because it's just as unique and gorgeous elsewhere. With all the cameras hidden away, the back of the phone is completely barren, with only the OPPO and Find X branding interrupting the otherwise blank slate. By this point, we're all programmed to avoid touching the upper third of the backs of our phones to keep from accidentally smudging the cameras, but it's oddly relieving to not have to worry about that here. The Find X also has some pretty eye-catching, beautiful finishes. On my Glacier Blue unit, the center of the glass back is a glossy deep black, but the edges subtly fade into a gorgeous dark blue that permeates to the metal frame. The Bordeaux Red model features the same gradient effect, but with more of a dark magenta hue. They're both incredible finishes that are unlike anything I've seen on other phones. Now despite all of the Find X's opulent hardware traits, there are a few letdowns here, too. There's no headphone jack, nor are there front-facing speakers — instead, there's a small speaker grill on the bottom edge that puts out disappointingly tinny audio. You also don't get wireless charging, despite this phone having a glass backing, but most damning of all, it isn't water resistant. This is obviously a necessary trade-off to achieve the motorized panel, but it's disappointing nonetheless — this phone is far too costly to be wiped out by a rainstorm or spilled glass. OPPO Find X Software I've gushed on for nearly a thousand words about the Find X's incredible hardware, but the software is a different story entirely. OPPO's ColorOS software runs on top of Android 8.1 Oreo, but you'd never know it from using the phone. This is a fundamentally different Android experience than any Western user will be accustomed to, and the vast majority of OPPO's changes do much more to harm the experience than improve it. From the moment you first set up the Find X, all of your apps are scattered across multiple pages of the home screen without an app drawer, iOS-style, and what would typically be the Google Feed to the left of the home screens has instead been replaced with OPPO's Smart Assistant. The latter makes sense, since Google's services aren't available in China, where OPPO originates, and Smart Assistant actually isn't bad; you can use it to quickly check the weather, track steps, see upcoming calendar events, and so on. Android Oreo on the Find X is completely unrecognizable through all of ColorOS's changes. The problems begin when you start trying to install … well, pretty much anything. OPPO has its own app store, but it's all in Chinese, even if you set the phone up in English, and the selection is miserable at best. Instead, you'll want to side-load the Google Play Store, which is as simple as downloading and installing the APK, but finding it takes a bit of work, no thanks to OPPO's browser, which — you guessed it — is all in Chinese. Once you've installed the Play Store and started downloading your favorite apps, you'll likely start running into other problems. Using a third-party keyboard like Gboard works well enough; but much like iOS, the Find X reverts to its default keyboard any time you input passwords — a somewhat reasonable security measure, if a bit annoying. If, however, you try to install a third-party launcher, you'll quickly find out that the Find X doesn't let you change launchers. The default launcher option in the system settings leads to a completely blank menu, no matter what you try, so … get used to ColorOS, I suppose. In fairness, OPPO says that's been fixed in a new software update, but I have yet to receive it on my unit. I also had a ton of trouble with Google Maps on the Find X. On a recent trip to New York, I was trying to pull up directions to my hotel from the airport, but the phone simply couldn't lock onto my location. Despite having a solid 4G connection, I waited almost five minutes before the phone could pull up directions, which were completely inaccurate because the phone had pinpointed me at a completely different part of town. Eventually I had to just give up and grab my Galaxy S9 to navigate around, but most people who buy this phone won't have a spare to fall back on, and I can't say I'd be confident getting around town with the Find X. It's easy enough to shrug these issues off and say that the phone wasn't intended for Western markets or Google Play services in the first place, but the troubles with ColorOS aren't exclusive to third-party apps. Dismissing individual notifications is a multi-step process now; you can't just swipe them away like most other phones. Instead, you'll have to swipe them to the left, which then slides out a trash icon you can tap to dismiss the notification. Every single time. For every notification. ColorOS has a few convenient features, but it's so broken in its current state that it makes the Find X hard to use. That's not so bad though, since you'll hardly receive notifications in the first place — at least, by default. After a few minutes with the Find X, you'll quickly start to notice that push notifications from apps aren't coming in. That's not because of aggressive background task management or a poor network connection; it's because by default, notifications are disabled for every third-party app. You actually have to go into the system settings and enable push notifications for each app individually. I can't overstate how awful of an experience this is, especially without a way to mass-approve every app at once. These issues are a real shame because the phone actually runs extremely smoothly — though that's no surprise, given the Snapdragon 845 and whopping 8GB of RAM in tow. The software has some genuinely convenient and useful features, like the swipe-up gesture navigation that replaces the three-button layout to regain the bottom of the screen, or the app cloning that allows for multiple accounts on a single service like Facebook or Instagram. Sadly, though, the benefits of ColorOS are far outweighed by its shortcomings. OPPO Find X Cameras The Find X features two cameras on the backside of its motorized module, one a 16MP primary sensor (1.22µm) and the other a 20MP sensory (1.0µm) that aids in portrait mode photography — both with an ƒ/2.0 aperture. Considering the Find X is priced similarly to the Galaxy Note 9 and iPhone X, I was comparatively underwhelmed by its cameras, but they're still impressive given just how narrow the sliding enclosure for the cameras is. Dynamic range is pretty great; I went on a hike with a few friends the other week, and even on darker paths shrouded from the sun by trees, the bright sky still came out blue in photos, rather than a blown out white. Colors are decent as well, if not a bit undersaturated, but I noticed a tendency for the cameras to overexpose. It's a quick enough fix in post, but I'd rather the phone just properly expose in the first place. I'm mostly happy with the Find X's cameras in daylight, but it gets pretty rough in even the slightest of dark conditions. While on that hike, I missed a lot of shots later in the evening because the cameras are just too slow in the dark, and despite the 16MP sensor's built-in OIS, most of my photos came out blurry and undefined. Take the Find X into a truly dark environment like a bar, and it just gets worse. Colors become muddy and clarity becomes all but nonexistent. Low light is a weakness of any phone's cameras, but I had hoped for better from a thousand dollar phone. What annoyed me most about shooting on the Find X is that the camera app has absolutely no settings. Save for the small bits of iconography strewn across the viewfinder, OPPO's camera software is a mostly take-it-or-leave-it experience, though I'm happy there's still at least a pro mode (OPPO calls it ""expert mode"") for manual controls. As far as video goes, you can shoot in 4K despite the display only reaching 1080p, but I more appreciated the option to shoot in 1080p at up to 120fps for smooth slow-motion shots. OPPO Find X Battery Life Battery life is actually one of the Find X's high points. It's a sizable 3730mAh, and combined with ColorOS's aggressive app management and the relatively low-resolution display (that's not a knock — 1080p is plenty good enough for most people), it's pretty hard to kill the phone in a single day. Even with the unavoidable constant gaps in service of riding the New York City Subway, which are notorious for running down any phone's battery, the Find X always made it through the day for me, typically with 20 or 30% to spare by midnight. ColorOS doesn't show screen-on time, but the Find X has no trouble making it through the day and then some. If you don't like how often ColorOS closes out idle background tasks, you can actually disable its app management in the system settings, though that'll likely impact battery life pretty significantly. Then again, you're still working with almost 4000mAh, so while endurance may be a bit worse without what OPPO calls ""app freezing,"" it'll still likely last you through the day without a hitch. When the phone does run down, it features OPPO's VOOC rapid charging for quick top-ups. If you've ever used another phone from OPPO or OnePlus, you already know all about VOOC charging — it's insanely fast; even with a 3730mAh battery, the Find X can reach a full charge in less than an hour, so long as you use the included charger. Even with a different charger, though, I was impressed with the charge times. I use my 15-inch MacBook Pro's 87W USB-C charger interchangeably with my laptop and phones, and I've found that the Find X charges fully in about 80 minutes. The only letdown with the Find X's battery life is standby time. If I leave the phone off the charger overnight, it loses nearly 10% of its charge. With such aggressive throttling of idle apps, I'm really not sure what could be draining the battery so much with the screen off, but it's definitely been disappointing whenever I pull the Find X out of my bag after a flight and notice how much it's lost. Should you buy it? Probably not This far in, it's pretty to guess my feelings on the Find X. I can't remember the last time a phone's design has captivated me the way this one has, from its unprecedented sliding mechanism to the incredible 93.8% screen-to-body ratio. It's not flawless — the camera panel traps dirt and dust pretty easily, and there's no telling how long the hardware will last, both because moving parts eventually fail and because the phone isn't water resistant in any way. But it's no stretch to say that the Find X has some of the most fascinating and impressive hardware of 2018. Sadly, great hardware doesn't get you very far when the accompanying software is as big a disaster as ColorOS. From annoying systemwide quirks to downright broken third-party app support and a complete disabling of notifications out of the box, the software on the Find X seems to combine all the worst parts of iOS and Android into a jumbled mess that make the phone hard to use — and even harder to recommend. If you're a hardware enthusiast with considerable money to spend, and you just want to marvel at the stunning design of the Find X, you can order one straight from Amazon for about $960. With future updates that promise to fix broken features like the inability to use third-party launchers, the Find X might eventually offer a better software experience. Until then, though, you can do a lot better than the Find X for a lot less money.

McFarland now faces one charge of wire fraud and one count of money laundering on top of the charges he faced from the original Fyre Festival. McFarland allegedly used one of his companies to sell $100,000 worth of fraudulent tickets to events like Coachella and the Met Gala and then sent the money to other peoples' bank accounts. What's more, McFarland allegedly committed these scams after he had already been charged over Fyre Festival and was awaiting trial. Good Lord. If this sounds familiar, it's because McFarland tried to pull this same stunt before, buying up tickets to high-profile events like the musical Hamilton in an attempt to make a little money in the resale market, only to have it all blow up in his face.

Ed Cara,"In the face of the Purge prequel we’re living out right now, it should come as a tiny bit reassuring that not every federal agency has closed—at least not completely—during this government shutdown. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will keep fighting and tracking the flu virus, which is important, because this year’s flu season is a disaster. Per Reuters : Earlier, the Department of Health and Human Services had released a contingency plan in case the Senate failed to pass a stopgap spending measure by a midnight deadline. According to that plan, the CDC’s flu tracking program would be suspended during a shutdown. But late Friday night, officials told reporters on a conference call that the program would continue. Along with collecting flu data from states, hospitals, and other sources, a CDC official said, they will be reporting “critical information needed for state and local health authorities to provide, track, prevent and treat the disease.” The decision comes into the midst of one of the worst flu seasons in recent time. Hospitals in California have set up triage units in their parking lots to deal with the overabundance of ER patients, and the flu has been classified as widespread throughout 49 states and Puerto Rico. More than 800 people died from flu in December alone, and there have been 30 pediatric deaths, as of last week, according to CDC data. Not all the lights are on at the CDC, though. Just this morning, the @CDCFlu account on Twitter announced it will be silent until the government is up and running again: If you haven’t already, it’s not too late to get the flu shot.","In the face of the Purge prequel we’re living out right now, it should come as a tiny bit reassuring that not every federal agency has closed—at least not completely—during this government shutdown.

Rebecca Ruiz,"When historians look back on 2017 and try to describe the profound cultural upheaval that brought down Hollywood titans and powerful politicians, they'll no doubt struggle to capture the ache and fury of women who spent their lives silenced by abusive men and finally decided they'd had enough. There's no tidy or sober way to describe the rot that women knew festered in our social, professional, and political institutions — a decay that once couldn't be named or fully exposed, until it was. SEE ALSO: 2017 was the year middle-aged women fought back When the accounts are written by those with more hindsight than we currently have, one man should play the starring role, and it's not movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. It's another master showman, the one we call president of the United States. The election of Donald Trump, who admitted to grabbing women's genitals against their will, to the nation's highest office confirmed what many women knew, and triggered a visceral awakening for others. Despite being well into the 21st century, America still clings to the notion that women are vessels whose bodies can be owned by men for pleasure. These bellwether moments are evidence of how women are increasingly embracing a pose of cultural and political defiance. As it turns out, though, confronting that ugly reality helped produce a dramatic shift in attitudes about gender. This might seem obvious based on the blockbuster success of the film Wonder Woman, or the unapologetic reckoning of the #MeToo movement, whose "" silence breakers "" were named ""Person of the Year"" by Time. It was clear in the defeat of accused pedophile and Trump-backed Senate candidate Roy Moore, whose retrograde policy views and racially divisive beliefs led to critical voter turnout among black women in Alabama. These bellwether moments are evidence of how women are increasingly embracing a pose of cultural and political defiance. They also collectively suggest women show no signs of tempering their outrage in 2018, a year that will bring Congressional midterm elections, the possible end to Robert Mueller's investigation of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, and new clashes over issues like immigration, health care, and race. That's not to mention any unforeseeable conflict sparked by Donald Trump's penchant for publicly demeaning women who oppose him. If the newfound enlightenment when it comes to gender equality and politics seems like a passing fad or a liberal fever dream, that shift is showing up in a way we can quantify: public opinion. Tresa Undem, partner in the polling firm PerryUndem, has spent the past 17 years asking people about their views, and she's used to tracking the slow pendulum of change swing toward a new consensus. But in the past year, Undem has witnessed an intriguing phenomenon. When she polled 1,058 voters from across the nation and political spectrum in late November, she discovered a surprising percentage of people altered their views in the past year. A new majority of voters thinks the country would be better off with more women in office, a figure that jumped from 52 percent to 69 percent between 2016 and 2017. Those who said sexism is a ""big"" problem in American society increased from 30 percent to 44 percent during the same time period. People aren't keeping these feelings private, either. Seven in 10 respondents in Undem's poll said they've talked to a friend or family member about issues related to gender equality. That marks a major increase from last year, when just 49 percent said they'd had similar conversations. ""I don’t know that I’ve seen these kinds of differences in my career in polling."" We can arguably trace this transformation partly back to Donald Trump, says Undem. When she analyzed the results of her nationally representative December 2016 poll of 1,302 adults, she found that the number one predictor of engaging in activism after the presidential election was feeling upset by Trump's behavior on the Access Hollywood tape. Undem believes that Hillary Clinton's loss, despite the tape's existence, played a significant role in the increased percentage of people who believe the country would be better off with more women in office. While these are just two polls, Undem is struck by the swift evolution in participants' opinions. ""I don’t know that I’ve seen these kinds of differences in my career in polling,"" she says. ""In my view, what’s happening right now is a result of a lot of things, but one of the biggest things was the Access Hollywood tape."" Neera Tanden, an informal adviser to Clinton's presidential campaign and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, knows what Undem means. In April, Tanden tweeted, ""I don't think the country has understood how psychologically wounding it was to so many women that Trump won after the Access Hollywood tape."" The observation has remained her pinned tweet for months. It's received 33,000 likes and 16,000 retweets. I don't think the country has understood how psychologically wounding it was to so many women that Trump won after the Access Hollywood tape https://t.co/asbo4Z1uWR — Neera Tanden🖖🏼 (@neeratanden) April 2, 2017 ""If you look at this year, the beginning, middle, and end of the year, it's fueled by what I hear as a primal scream for women’s equality,"" Tanden says. Indeed, people demonstrated by the millions in January's Women's March. Women were prominent voices in protests against Trump's travel ban, the decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and Congress' attempt to repeal Obamacare, among other political battles. They dressed up as characters from The Handmaid's Tale to protest restrictions on reproductive rights, and they confronted racism on the left in tense exchanges on the private Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. ""If you look at this year, it's fueled by what I hear as a primal scream for women’s equality."" Women ran for office in unprecedented numbers and notched historic victories. Charlotte, North Carolina, elected its first black female mayor in the city's history. A transgender woman unseated a conservative Virginia lawmaker who authored a ""bathroom bill"" that would've required people to use the restroom that matched the gender listed on their birth certificates. And when the media's attention wasn't trained on the liberal women who form the backbone of the resistance movement, Trump's own tweets reminded the public why they oppose him in the first place. Whether he was harassing and insulting women like Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski, Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fl.), or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Trump frequently found ways to illustrate his taste for uniquely berating women who defy his authority. It's a wonder, then, that national news organizations barely revisited the dozens of accusations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump for the first half of the year, even as they helped drive women's opposition to Trump's agenda. (The White House maintains all of the women are lying.) ""This man did this terrible thing, he wins, and the media treated it like everything got wiped out by the election,"" Tanden says. ""But women said: 'I didn't forget what he did.'"" Tanden believes that Democratic elected officials, including a star like Sen. Al Franken, should also be held accountable for sexual misconduct. SEE ALSO: Female senators lead the way in calling for Al Franken's resignation on Twitter When people warn Tanden about the possibility of a backlash against the #MeToo movement, she offers a different take: ""#MeToo, in my view, is a backlash to Donald Trump. I don’t think it’s an accident that we had a gigantic discussion of sexual harassment and assault, and what it means for women reaching their potential. It's a cultural response to misogyny taking over the White House."" ""It's a cultural response to misogyny taking over the White House."" The fact that Republican leaders haven't taken women's opposition to Trump seriously worries Evan Siegfried, a Republican strategist and author of GOP GPS: How to Find the Millennials and Urban Voters the Republican Party Needs to Survive. In January, Siegfried wrote a New York Times op-ed imploring his party's leadership to learn from participants in the Women's March. That advice, he says, has gone unheeded and may help spell the party's doom in the 2018 midterm elections. Siegfried finds that particularly troubling, since the GOP has long faced criticism that it wages a ""war on women,"" and Trump isn't helping the party's case. Instead, Siegfried describes Trump as ""steroids"" that are making the symptoms of that problem far worse. ""Women are disgusted with the Republican party for myriad reasons,"" he says, noting the impact of the Access Hollywood tape and the #MeToo movement. ""At the same time, among Democrats and progressives, organizations are taking anger, the most abundant renewal energy source invented in the world, and harnessing it and making it productive."" Trump’s disapproval with women- 68% and millennials- 61%. Both were groups that have helped Dems win in NJ, VA, Alabama and other 2017 races https://t.co/pjCK2nJr1b — Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) December 13, 2017 That poses a real threat to the GOP's grip on Congressional power. If women who oppose Trump help drive Republicans from office in the midterm elections, it could put the House of Representatives in the control of Democrats, who'd be willing to investigate the assault allegations against the president, and have indicated they're considering the possibility of impeaching him. Neither Undem nor Tanden see an imminent end to the current cultural and political moment. Undem continues to be surprised by sentiments shared in focus groups, including the feeling that people are still energized to fight Trump's agenda. Tanden believes that women, including those who are entering politics and activism for the first time, are only just getting started. ""There are backlashes and forward movements, but my basic view is Donald Trump is giving rise to a new wave of feminism that will transform the country,"" Tanden says. ""It will be women that defeat that him.""","When historians look back on 2017 and try to describe the profound cultural upheaval that brought down Hollywood titans and powerful politicians, they'll no doubt struggle to capture the ache and fury of women who spent their lives silenced by abusive men and…",2017-12-22T16:54:59Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",Trump was a disaster for women in 2017.

FRANCES ROBLES and SHERI FINK,"Following public debate over the Trump administration’s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service. Photo Staffed with 800 medical personnel, the hospital ship admitted about 290 patients. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times The result, combined with the reluctance of some hospitals to lose their own patients, fell far short of what the Comfort could have provided, medical experts said. “They were prepared for anything other than the reality of Puerto Rico,” said José Vargas Vidot, a doctor and independent senator in the Puerto Rican Senate whose charitable organization, Iniciativa Comunitaria, supported the post-hurricane medical clinic directed by Dr. Rosado. “It was like a vision in the harbor. Everybody was looking at the Comfort, like trying to build hope. But in the reality it was very frustrating to get access.” Staffed with 800 personnel and costing $180,000 a day, the ship received an average of 36 people a day as outpatients or inpatients. (A New York Times reporter was one of them, given an X-ray and medicine for an asthmatic cough). And that number swelled only after a public furor erupted over the ship’s empty beds. “That’s not the right question,” said Capt. Kevin Buckley, the commander of the ship’s medical facility, when asked how many patients were admitted. The right question, he said, was: “What kind of patients do you have?” The patients who arrived in the early weeks “were as sick as the sickest patient in any I.C.U. where I’ve worked,” said Capt. José A. Acosta, the United States Third Fleet surgeon, a Puerto Rican-trained physician who served as a liaison with the Comfort. In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the ship. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. One woman had a double mastectomy, and the ship filled the oxygen tanks for dozens of patients who needed help breathing. It took in some patients from hospitals where generators had failed. It treated 98 critically ill patients, eleven of whom died. The Comfort’s deployment was not the only federal health care initiative after Maria hit. Federal field hospitals, clinics and medical shelters saw more than 30,000 patients, and more than 1,400 uninsured people filled their prescriptions at pharmacies for free thanks to a federal reimbursement program. Photo Medical staff took a blood sample from a patient in the emergency room aboard the Comfort. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times A mid-November visit to the ship found dozens of people waiting to see doctors in the tents set up outside, but inside most of the beds were empty. Only a handful of patients were on board, and most of the doctors were milling about. But those who were getting treatment appeared satisfied. Olga Quezada’s knee had swollen up as if someone had pumped air into it. She had been turned away by her local hospital, and she worried about the pain, the bill and finding care. Ship doctors stuck a frighteningly long needle into her knee to drain the fluid, for free. “At first, I went to hospital in Bayamón, and they told me to come back,” Ms. Quezada said. She added: “I really like the doctors here.” The Comfort is used on relief missions about every two years. It served off the coast of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 and provided aid during the rescue of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994. The Comfort was deployed in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, the Comfort provided much-needed surgical care, but communication with referring doctors and with family members was problematic. Some patients died during laborious, multistep transfers, and some doctors felt the ship left too soon. Doctors in Puerto Rico said the Comfort could have been of enormous help directly after the storm, because at first many hospitals were damaged or shuttered. Without air-conditioning, temperatures soared dangerously, and operating rooms were closed as generators failed. Emergency room staff sewed wounds, lanced boils and examined patients by the light of cellphones and flashlights. They lacked access to CT scans. In the 10 days after the Sept. 20 storm, the number of deaths in Puerto Rico jumped to an average of 118 a day, 36 more than usual. Photo A radiology specialist prepared a patient for an X-ray aboard the Comfort, which deployed to Puerto Rico for 53 days. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times But the ship did not leave Virginia until Sept. 29, arriving in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3. Problems quickly emerged. For starters, the Comfort lacked critical capacities, including the ability to treat premature babies and patients with common antibiotic-resistant infections, head trauma and strokes requiring neurosurgery, or heart conditions needing bypass surgery. One doctor was heard complaining about receiving so-called “social cases”— patients who would be difficult to discharge because they lost their homes or lacked caregivers. When the ship docked in San Juan, residents were thrilled. “People saw the big, white ship and came running,” said Murad Raheem, a regional emergency coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services who oversaw the federal government’s health response to the disaster. The Comfort cared for 67 patients in its first two days, but wasn’t set up to receive unscreened patients, Mr. Raheem said. Soon after the ship’s arrival, Puerto Rican and federal officials and local medical professionals met on the Comfort. They decided the ship should move around the island to assist “wherever the needs were at the time,” Mr. Raheem said. But they agreed that doctors around the island would need to vet potential patient transfers through the Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration, the large and overburdened public hospital in San Juan that normally served as a referral center. Only if the hospital was full would a case be reviewed for possible referral to the Comfort. Patient flow slowed to a trickle. According to the Navy, only 137 patients were delivered over a period of three weeks. The first phone numbers provided by the public hospital did not work, and others had to be established. Callers overwhelmed the cellphone of the emergency department director after his number was posted on Facebook. Photo In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the Comfort. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times In areas without working cellphones, land lines or satellite phones, and with only ambulance radios to communicate, “referring patients to the Comfort was impossible,” said Dr. Rene Purcell-Jordan, an emergency room physician in Yauco, in southwest Puerto Rico. Dr. Purcell and other doctors said they also had little information about what type of patients the Comfort could or would treat. Some problems were beyond the Comfort’s control. Poor weather grounded helicopters. Some local hospital administrators were reluctant to give up their patients, and sometimes patients themselves wanted to stay near home, even when conditions at their hospitals appeared dangerous. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló petitioned for changes. He said the ship’s roving mission was appropriate immediately after the storm when roads were impassable, but that as time passed it made more sense to allow seven hub hospitals to refer patients directly and ultimately for patients to refer themselves. The Comfort returned to the port in Old San Juan. This time, federal Disaster Medical Assistance Teams set up in tents outside the ship, and thousands of people went for prescriptions and care. Those who needed something the tents could not provide, like surgery or X-rays, were taken on to the ship. “No one who walked up to the ship has been denied care,” Captain Buckley said. Officials at the public hospital defended the Comfort’s operation. “The Comfort was not a party boat,” said Dr. Carlos A. Gómez, the head of the hospital’s emergency room. “You need criteria to go to a hospital, whether it’s at sea or on land.” Still, the mission to the end remained murky. On Nov. 15 the Comfort left the dock, with a spokesman saying the ship planned to restock at sea and then resume treating patients. On Nov. 17, the ship was ordered home, for good, without warning.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

Mark Kelly,"Captain Mark Kelly (US Navy, retired) is a combat veteran and former NASA astronaut. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) In 2001, I flew my first flight into space aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Roughly a decade later, I commanded that same space shuttle on its final flight. That trip was my fourth journey -- and at least for now, my final one -- from this planet into space. To see our planet as this majestic blue ball floating in the blackness of space is breathtaking. It is truly the most amazing thing I've ever seen. When you see it for the first time it appears perfect. Bright and mostly blue, it's a literal island in our solar system. And make no mistake -- right now, we have no place else to go. Too often, we forget that this remarkable and fragile place is our only home, a point that was underscored earlier this month at the largest gathering of Earth scientists in New Orleans. At the conference, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) made a sobering announcement. It came as part of a study of climate change on 2016's weather. The scientists behind the study concluded that without climate change, three of the most severe weather events that took place that year would not have happened. Which events? 1. Heat waves that scorched parts of Asia, including India and Thailand, killing more than 500 people. 2. A patch of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean that's had harmful effects on marine life along the coast of North America. 3. And rising air temperatures that made 2016 the hottest in recorded history. The impact of climate change -- the scars that it's leaving on our planet -- is visible from above, too. There is visible pollution over large portions of the Earth. You often see this over the Asian sub-continent. The burning of wood and plastic and other materials to heat the homes of hundreds of millions of Indians creates a thick smoke over thousands of square miles. In China, the problem is more industrialized and more severe. Coal power plants and millions of cars have polluted the skies over eastern China to the extent that I can honestly say I don't believe I have seen the terra firma of eastern China during my four missions into space. It is hidden by a constant blanket of tiny airborne particles of despair. Perhaps the thing that worries me the most is the massive deforestation underway in areas like Asia and Latin America. Countless trees and millions of square miles of jungle and forest have been removed to accommodate our desires for more -- more wood, more farmland, more pasture, more meat. When I first looked down upon the Amazon rainforest in 2001, I saw vast areas of jungle and a wide and winding copper colored river that went on and on and on. A river that was impossible to miss and like no other on the planet. By 2011, however, the part that was most noticeable wasn't the river or the jungle but the large swaths of empty land. From space, it looks empty because we are far away. We don't see the crops or the cattle but we do see the loss. We see the loss of an incredibly diverse ecosystem that once held endless possibilities for new medicines and other discoveries. We see the loss of a home for so many species that will now have to learn to adapt and survive somewhere else -- or not. And we see the loss of a large amount of carbon, sequestered in a living and breathing ecosystem which created massive amounts of oxygen for all of us. That carbon, once the giver of life to millions of species all over our planet, now has a new role: greenhouse gas. It will sit in our atmosphere as CO and CO2 for millennia, but in this case as an invisible blanket, warming our planet, changing our climate and creating a cataclysmic mess for future generations. As an astronaut, I'm often asked about the climate, our environment, and how we are destroying the Earth. My response often surprises people. ""Don't worry about the planet, the Earth will be just fine,"" I tell them. ""What you need to worry about is us -- all of us."" This year has been an unequivocal disaster for the future of the planet. President Donald Trump has managed to take a wrecking ball to years' worth of hard work and painstaking negotiations. If not undone, our retreat from the Paris Climate Accords and the EPA's Clean Power Plan alone mean our planet's temperature will rise at a greater rate and our citizen's health will degrade. Other changes in environmental regulations on drilling and auto and appliance efficiency will only make matters worse. The United States was handed the mantle of leadership on this and so many other issues decades ago for a reason. It is because we are good at it. Our President has an obligation to look closely at the raw data on climate change. If he does, I think he will reach the same conclusion that I and so many others have reached. As you pass over the United States in space at night you can see, with your own naked eye, the bright lights that prove we lead the world in energy consumption. It is very obvious. What's not obvious is whether our country will adequately respond to this reality. As the largest consumer of energy we must lead the way in solving this problem. If we don't do this, who will?","In 2001, I flew my first flight into space aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Roughly a decade later, I commanded that same space shuttle on its final flight.

Fergus Jensen,"CIGONDONG/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesia reels from the carnage of yet another natural disaster, authorities around the globe are working on how they can prepare for the kind of freak tsunami that battered coasts west of Jakarta this month. 
The Dec. 23 tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire. 
No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore. 
Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place. 
But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened. 
“Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton. 
Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands. 
During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic metres, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea. 
But the eruption didn’t rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia’s geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami. 
Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later told Reuters its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events. 
The head of Japan’s International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan’s current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait. 
“We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there’s 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,” he said in Jakarta. 
Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 km (100 miles) west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a “tsunami hazard.” 
Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. 
BROKEN WARNING SYSTEM 
Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week’s tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau. 
But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say. 
“The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday’s tsunami was not detected,” said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. 
“Signs that a tsunami was coming weren’t detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.” 
President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau. 
The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia’s total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho. 
But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult. 
“The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,” said seismologist Hicks. 
In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country’s Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake. 
He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to “re-emphasize awareness and preparedness” regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines. 
The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service. 
MORE EDUCATION 
In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok. 
In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness. 
“Given the potential for disasters in the country, it’s time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,” Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami. 
For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week’s waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough. 
He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training. 
“I’ve never received education on safety steps,” he said. 
“The system...totally failed.”

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"After an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia on Friday left more than 800 people dead, a spokesperson for the nations board of national disaster affairs revealed that a critical part of its warning and detection system hasnt been working for years. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said a network of 22 early-detection buoys havent been operational since 2012, Australias ABC News reported. The buoys, which communicate with seafloor sensors, are supposed to send tsunami warnings to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, but are now ineffective due to vandalism and a lack of funding, according to the report. The tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning, Louise Comfort, a disaster management expert, told the Associated Press. None of the 22 buoys are functioning. In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide. BMKG reportedly sent out a tsunami warning on Friday evening after the earthquake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Efforts to create better advance tsunami warning systems started after 230,00 people died in a 2004 tsunami, with a majority of those deaths occurring in Indonesia. The buoys were among those effortsGermany and the U.S. reportedly provided 12 of them. However, an earthquake that hit an Indonesian island in 2016 revealed that none of the buoys were working. The buoys have been stalled in a prototype phase for years, reportedly failing to receive the funding needed because of budget cuts and a failure for agencies to agree on project decisions. The buoys reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each on top of the funding needed to maintain their operations. Now we have no buoys in Indonesia, Iyan Turyana, an ocean engineer at BPPT, Indonesias Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told Phys.org in an article published in January 2017.

Shannon Connellan,"Japan is experiencing what could be one of the worst weather-related disasters in its history, following the heaviest rainfall the country has experienced for decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned of a ""race against time"" to rescue flood victims on Sunday, as emergency response teams in the country's western regions search for at least 60 missing, after floods and landslides caused by torrential rains killed over 100 people. SEE ALSO: California's wine country fire has been brewing for years Since the downpours started Thursday, evacuations had been ordered for up to 5.9 million people in 19 prefectures, according to The Japan Times, but this has been scaled back to 2 million since the weekend. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency is reported to have counted over 30,000 people accommodated in temporary evacuation centres as of Sunday. Some of the affected areas include Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Ehime, Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Hyogo, Shiga, Gifu, Kochi and Saga, with the Hiroshima and Okayama Prefectures among the hardest hit. It's the worst weather-related disaster in the country since 2011, when nearly 100 people were killed by two typhoons in August and September. The Times reports over 1,000 people in Okayama found themselves trapped on rooftops after the Oda River burst, with many rescued by helicopter or boat. It's hard to imagine this happening to you, but photographs taken of the affected areas bring these tragic events a little closer to home.

Morgan Sung,"Guy Fieri isn't just the mayor of Flavortown. He's a national hero. As the Carr fire scorches through Northern California, becoming the seventh most destructive fire in the state's history, Guy Fieri rushed to feed the thousands of first responders and evacuees. Some people think the celebrity chef has been more helpful during this disaster than Elon Musk was during the Thai cave rescue. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's kid-submarine was 'a PR stunt,' Thailand cave rescue diver says The Carr fire started on July 23, torching more than 112,000 acres and sweeping through the city of Redding. Fieri drove from Napa Valley on Saturday, and José Andrés' nonprofit World Central Kitchen joined him two days later. Since Monday, Fieri and his team have prepared over 1,000 meals twice a day with the disaster aid organization Operation BBQ Relief. ""My son and I, and his buddies, and a bunch of mine, we loaded up our caravan from wine country and drove four hours up here,"" Fieri told ABC7. ""We're in tough times... with all of the things going on, you take a moment like this and you really see America is made of a lot of great people coming together."" This is the second time that Fieri has volunteered to feed victims of California wildfires. Last October, he and his family had to evacuate their Santa Rosa home when fires threatened his neighborhood. Three days later, he arrived at the evacuation center with a smoker and a wood fire oven to cook for the displaced shelter residents, preparing 1,200 meals in one lunch. He told KQED that the move wasn't a ""PR stunt."" ""If that's what you think and you're that shallow at a time like this with what we're facing, then there's no changing your mind about that,"" he said during the October fires. ""I'm not promoting anything. I'm just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I'm here to help. That's it."" And some Twitter users pointed out that unlike certain rich celebrities who try to swoop in during disasters, Fieri's efforts were genuine. In a now-deleted tweet, @BowieWhale said, ""Guy Fieri has, with no publicity, been feeding 5000 wildfire evacuees, proving that he is much more decent and altruistic than Elon Musk."" They're referring to the cave debacle, when Musk tried to save a team of boys who were stranded in an underwater cave in Thailand. Musk commissioned a kid-size submarine, went on a Twitter rant when it was criticized as ""not practical,"" and then called Vern Unsworth — one of the lead rescuers — a ""pedo"" after he dismissed the mini sub as a ""PR stunt"" that had ""absolutely no chance of working."" Musk managed to make the rescue mission about himself, and then when he couldn't be the hero, still managed to make it about himself. Which is why Guy Fieri is the internet's new darling. With his bleached spiky hair and weird affinity for flame-printed button up shirts, Fieri has been written off as a cheesy dad way past his prime. But compared to Musk's ridiculous narcissistic Twitter feuds with pretty much anyone who criticizes him, Fieri's once tacky quirks are actually kind of endearing. Guy Fieri out here feeding thousands of wildfire refugees, after feeding thousands in Puerto Rico, without publicity and y'all still trying to dunk on the Mayor of Flavortown.

Tom McKay,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety. Yes, that means Donald Trump can now put your phone on blast. No, he probably won’t use the system to text you throughout the day with rambling bullshit about “ 13 Angry Democrats ” or wishing “the haters and losers” a “special” September 11th, at least according to experts who spoke with NBC News. The wireless emergency alerts (WEA) system was first approved by Congress in 2015 and restricts usage of the system to instances of “a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety.” According to NBC, those experts say the system is a good idea in a time when people are glued to their phones and the internet: “If you separate this from the politics and personality of any individual president then this is a great idea and an amazing use of technology to reach everybody if they’re in harms way,” said Karen North, director of the Annenberg Digital Social Media program at the University of Southern California. UCLA communications professor Tim Groeling agreed, writing via email, “broadcast-based emergency alert systems... have remained professional and impartial over decades... A system like this seems necessary in an era where most people are disconnected from ‘live’ media like radio and television.” If Trump were to order FEMA to warn the nation of the emergency threat posed by the cowardly Jeff Sessions and the very corrupt and unfair Robert Mueller, he would probably be in violation of the law—which, granted, is something he doesn’t seem particularly concerned about. However, anyone actually attempting to use the system would have to go through FEMA (namely, its Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System) and rely on support staff trained in the complicated process necessary to transmit the message. As Vox reported, even those suspicious the president would abuse WEA generally agree it is a good idea: Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told me that the wireless alert system is a good idea, as is testing it — but having someone as volatile as Trump with control over it is concerning. “I’m not sure that the system would protect us from rogue announcements by a president who has exhibited the kind of behavior President Trump has over the last two years,” Redlener said. “I personally would not give this microphone to Donald Trump.”...“We need to accept the fact that any of these systems can fail, miscommunications can go out when the wrong button’s being pushed. That’s a given for any system of this type,” Redlener said. “What I’m more concerned about is the president of the United States taking control over such a system intentionally to create havoc, to make some sort of highly disruptive, highly political announcement.” FEMA itself noted that the alert system is “only for national emergencies” on Twitter: To the extent WEA has been criticized, it’s mainly been that the system has inherent limitations like a 90 character limit—partially as a result of pushback from carriers and smartphone manufacturers resistant to spending time and money on it. It’s not possible to opt out of the system, and one shouldn’t, unless they like being caught off guard by potentially life-threatening disasters. However, it is possible to tweak an individual phone’s settings to simply ignore it (not recommended). Regional WEA systems are already in place—for example, those AMBER Alert messages advising residents of the details of child abductions as well as flash flood, tornado, and hurricane warnings already go out using the system. Hundreds of agencies have access to the system. As Mashable noted, the national WEA test is new, but there have been three prior national tests of the predecessor Emergency Alert System, which goes out over television and radio. Tests of the system are required every three years or less under the law, according to CNN. The message going out on Thursday will read an English-only message stating “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” [ NBC News ]","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety.

Andrew Krok,"Hyundai started 2019 off right by teasing a concept vehicle that could allegedly walk and climb. Now, Hyundai has brought this concept to CES 2019, and it's every bit as wild as we hoped.
Hyundai used CES 2019 as the backdrop to debut its Elevate walking car concept. While it's primarily designed to give first responders an additional edge in rescuing people, it can also be used to enhance mobility options for all sorts of citizens. 
The pictures make it pretty obvious how this car gained the ability to move less like a vehicle and more like a creepy robot animal -- while it does have traditional wheels on each corner, they're connected to the vehicle by way of mechanical ""legs."" Those legs have multiple axes of articulation, and since the electric motors that power the concept are in the wheels themselves, there are no powertrain linkages complicating matters.
According to Hyundai, the Elevate is capable of driving at highway speeds, but it can also allegedly climb a 5-foot wall, step over a 5-foot gap and have a track width up to 15 feet. So, it's basically an AT-AT from Star Wars that has, as Hyundai puts it, ""both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits."" 
The model on display at CES is just a 1:8 scale model, sadly, but it's still absolutely nuts.
Hyundai
""Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers,"" said David Byron, design manager of Sundberg-Ferar, which worked on the concept, in a statement. ""This is the future of vehicular mobility.""
The Elevate rides on an electric ""skateboard"" platform, onto which the body is attached. This gives the concept a little extra flexibility, with bodies that can be removed and swapped out depending on the needs of the moment. To keep things efficient, the legs can cut power to its joints when acting like a normal vehicle. 
Of course, first responders are the first group I think of when it comes to the Hyundai Elevate. Being able to better traverse rubble and other detritus, which could be the result of a natural disaster, could allow emergency personnel a better chance of saving as many people as possible. But there are other use cases, too -- Hyundai has an example image with a New York taxi livery, lifting itself up to make ingress easier for a person in a wheelchair. The sky's the limit, which I guess makes sense given the concept's name.

Frederic Lardinois,"If you know about Synology, chances are you know about its network attaches storage (NAS) hardware. Over the course of the last few years, the company made a name for itself as one of the premiere NAS providers for consumers and small businesses who want to make local backups of their data or make it easy for users in an office to share local drive space. Now, the company is making a major move into the cloud with the worldwide launch of its C2 Backup service for its NAS systems, which was previously only available in Europe. To be clear, C2 Backup is all about backing up your Synology NAS system in the cloud. It’s not a competitor to online backup services like iDrive, Carbonite or Backblaze. If you are a Synology NAS users, though, this service gives you yet another degree of security. Backing up your data locally is a good first step, after all, but if a disaster strikes your office, your backups are gone, too. Synology has long offered the ability to store backups in the cloud (on Amazon’s S3 service, for example), but it clearly wants a piece of this business, too. “The flexibility of cloud backup in terms of low barrier to entry and strong future scalability plays a key role in the rapid growth of this market. With the demand for offsite data protection on the rise, we have received numerous requests from regions outside EMEA to expand our C2 Backup coverage,” said Jia-Yu Liu, Director of the Application Group at Synology. “We are happy to announce that all users around the world can now enjoy the same seamless backup experience designed specifically for Synology NAS.” Pricing for the service seems pretty fair, with plans that start at €9.99/year for 100 GB of backed up data. Prices go up to €59.99/year for a terabyte. Under these plans, you can store 11 backup versions which remain in the system for 30 days. What’s nice here is that only the size of the source data counts against your storage usage, not the individual backups. For users who need more flexibility, the company also offers a €69.99/TB/year plan with flexible backup schedules and customizable retention policies. The company is also offering a 30-day free trial. A subscription business is obviously a smart move for Synology. The company mostly relied on its hardware sales for its business so far, but with the C2 Backup and the existing C2 Disaster Recovery services, it now offers two subscription services with recurring revenue.","If you know about Synology, chances are you know about its network attaches storage (NAS) hardware.

If they had known, they never would have bought the house on Bayou Glen Road. Sure, it was a beautiful lot, tucked in a bend of the creek, backyard woodsy and wild, the neighbors friendly and the street quiet. A little piece of nature just 20 minutes from downtown Houston. It was exactly what John and Heather Papadopoulos recently married, hoping to start a family were looking for in 2007. They didn't think much about the creek that ran along their yard, aside from appreciating the birds it attracted to the neighborhood.
Across town, the Evans family was similarly indifferent to the wooded bayous that cut through their neighborhood. Janice Perry-Evans chose the house she rented because it was conveniently located near the local high school, which made it easy for her two boys to get to class and home from football practice. Her commute to the post office wasn't far either. Plus, at $800 per month, the rent was affordable. By 2017, the family had lived there for four years, and didn't have any plans to move. 
And then, in August of that year, both homes were destroyed. Both families had to start over from nothing. But today, one family is financially stable. The other is facing bankruptcy.
John Papadopoulos stands in the rental home in Houston where he and his family moved after their house flooded. The taxidermied deer are among the few items they were able to rescue from their flooded home.

Disasters are becoming more common in America. In the early and mid-20th century, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. counties experienced a disaster each year. Today, it's about 50 percent. According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, climate change is already driving more severe droughts, floods and wildfires in the U.S. And those disasters are expensive. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually helping communities rebuild and prevent future damage. But an NPR investigation has found that across the country, white Americans and those with more wealth often receive more federal dollars after a disaster than do minorities and those with less wealth.Federal aid isn't necessarily allocated to those who need it most; it's allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk.
Put another way, after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer. And federal disaster spending appears to exacerbate that wealth inequality.
The Flood
Nowhere are the economic and racial inequities of disaster aid more apparent than in communities that have experienced one of the most costly and widespread disasters: urban flooding.
Houston is arguably ground zero for urban flooding a sprawling city built on low and marshy flatlands exposed to hurricanes blowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past decade, there have been five major floods in the city, culminating in the largest amount of rain ever recorded from a single storm: Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.
The Papadopoulos and Evans families were two of the hundreds of thousands of families who evacuated their homes during the storm.
After Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast in August 2017, the storm stalled over Houston and dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on some parts of the region.
Katie Hayes Luke for NPR
""We were the first ones to evacuate out of our house, up the street,"" remembers John Papadopoulos. In the years before the hurricane, their home had gone from a refuge to a nightmare. It flooded in 2009, in 2015 and in 2016. By 2017, they knew what to do: Put the valuables up high, and get out. They went to a neighbor's house first, and then to a hotel.
It was a new experience for the Evans family. ""When the water started coming up, we thought we were going to have to go on the roof,"" says Janice Perry-Evans. ""But we ended up not going on the roof. We ended up, me and the kids, packing up a little bit of stuff"" in a plastic container.
""We got out and we walked in that water,"" she remembers. The water was up to her armpits in places. Eventually, a dump truck carried them to a bus, and the bus dropped them at the convention center downtown.
The next morning, Perry-Evans and Papadopoulos took the same first step to start rebuilding their lives they turned to the federal government for help. But almost immediately, their experiences diverged.

From the beginning, a lot of things went right for the Papadopoulos family. John's employer, Microsoft, gave him as much time off as he needed and more than $10,000 to help with rent and other bills that piled up after the flood. The Papadopouloses rented a townhouse nearby and, within a few months, the federal aid they had applied for began to arrive.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency gave them $30,000; because the family owned a home that had been destroyed in the flood, the Internal Revenue Service sent checks for more than $100,000 in refunded taxes a perk of having a relatively high income. The Small Business Administration gave the family a low-interest loan.
About a year after the storm, Papadopoulos said, his family was financially stable.
The Evans family was not.

Janice Perry-Evans had one goal after the floodwaters receded: find a place to stay. She didn't have any savings for a hotel or a new apartment, so when a co-worker offered her a room in his house, she took it, even though it was one room for her and her three kids and it was a 45-minute drive from work and school.
Then, she started applying for help from FEMA.
The agency gave her about $2,500, enough to cover a deposit and first month's rent in a new place, but Perry-Evans needed the money for something else. Her oldest son was hoping for a college football scholarship. He couldn't afford to miss school or football practice that fall, and the family couldn't afford for Perry-Evans to miss shifts as a mail carrier for the post office.
""I had to go to work, and I had to get these boys back and forth to school. So I took that [money] and I put it for a car,"" she explains.
With her immediate transportation needs met, Perry-Evans went back to FEMA to see about getting more money for housing, but she says agency representatives reprimanded her for incorrectly using the money she had been given.
Perry-Evans never missed a day of work as a mail carrier for the USPS in the months she spent applying for disaster funds.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""Some of them were kind of rude,"" she remembers. ""Some of them felt sorry for me because I would be crying, [saying] 'Hey, I have nowhere to go. I don't have no money. You guys are not helping me like I thought.' ""
FEMA didn't block Perry-Evans from reapplying for housing money, but she says after the scolding she turned to other potential sources of federal aid, unsuccessfully. Her income wasn't high enough to claim a significant tax refund. She says she was denied a low-interest loan from the Small Business Administration because her credit score was too low. A FEMA representative suggested she try to get housing money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but after she used her day off to go to an information session, she was informed that her income was too high to qualify.
""It was like every time I tried something, it was an obstacle in the way,"" she says.
The entire time, Perry-Evans says, she never missed a shift at the post office. She even worked the week that Hurricane Harvey hit Houston. She often worked six days a week. But her paycheck just wasn't enough to cover all her bills, and her co-worker said it was time for the family to move out of the spare room.
Six months after the flood, Perry-Evans did the only thing she felt she could: She signed a lease to rent a house that cost 50 percent more than where they used to live, for less space. The electricity didn't always work. For more than a year after the flood, Perry-Evans was still sleeping on a cot she took from the convention center.
The Rich Get Richer; The Poor Get Poorer
Perry-Evans is not alone in her struggle. ""Recovery for vulnerable families [looks] a lot different than it does for more affluent neighborhoods,"" says Kathy Payton, the director of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corp., a neighborhood nonprofit that works a few miles from where Perry-Evans lives.

Payton grew up in Houston and has spent decades supporting the basic needs of her neighbors, many of whom live on fixed incomes or do not have a cushion of savings to fall back on after a disaster.
""We had loss of income because people lost their jobs. We had increased health issues as a result of them living in bad situations,"" she says, ticking off the cascade of challenges lower-income families have contended with since the flood. Many families struggle to successfully apply for money because they do not have access to a computer, she says, or do not have all the paperwork they need, or can't take time off from work to meet with a FEMA representative.
Payton says wealthier families are more able to comply with the rigid application requirements. ""There shouldn't be a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all template,"" she says. ""You've got to make adjustments based on the vulnerabilities and the needs of the families. And that's not what we do.""
Those application requirements are not explicitly designed to favor some citizens over others. Under the 1988 federal disaster relief law, the requirements exist to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or improper payouts after a storm, by keeping track of who has been given money for what.
But Payton says the upshot in Houston is that the more affluent parts of the city have recovered more quickly and deeply since the flood. Private insurance accounts for some of that, but Payton also believes residents in those areas have been more successful at getting federal money.
""Those families who are more apt to be able to respond to that [funding] will do so quickly, will do so more efficiently and the funds will be available on a first come, first serve basis,"" she says. Families who cannot, she says, ""will be left behind again.""
Football players gather at C.E. King High School. Perry-Evans' younger son is on the team. After the family was displaced by the flood, Perry-Evans needed to use the $2,500 she had received from FEMA for a car because they were living more than 45 minutes away.
Claire Harbage/NPR
A new and growing body of research backs up Payton's observations. Studies by sociologists, as well as climate scientists, urban planners and economists, suggest that disasters, and the federal aid that follows, disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans. The same is also true along racial lines, with white communities benefiting disproportionately.
""Cities are often very unequal to begin with,"" says James Elliott, a sociologist at Rice University. ""They're segregated and there are lots of income disparities, but what seems to happen after natural hazards hit is these things become exacerbated.""
""We see these same patterns of wealth inequality being exacerbated in communities that receive more FEMA aid,"" explains sociologist Junia Howell of the University of Pittsburgh. Howell and Elliott have published multiple studies that find a pattern in who wins and who loses after floods and other disasters: Rich people get richer after a storm, and poor people get poorer.
""That's particularly true along racial lines, along lines of education, as well as homeownership versus renting,"" explains Howell. And rather than mitigating the inequity, federal aid exacerbates it, in part because of the biases Payton has noticed that are baked into how federal money is distributed.
NPR examined one federal disaster program and found evidence of exactly that phenomenon. The program uses federal and local money to purchase homes that have flooded or been affected by other natural disasters and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
The buyouts are voluntary, and the homeowner can use the money to move to a safer place. As climate change drives more extreme rain, David Maurstad of FEMA says he expects the program to grow more in the coming years.
But buyouts have disproportionately gone to whiter communities. NPR analyzed records of about 40,000 property buyouts funded by FEMA and state and local governments and found that most of them were in neighborhoods that were more than 85 percent white and non-Hispanic. (For context, the nation as a whole is 62 percent white/non-Hispanic, and disasters affect communities of all demographics.)

A Tale of Two Cities
Hurricane Harvey in Houston was a cataclysmic event. But more extreme rainfall is falling all over the United States, and that means more flooding. The trend will continue in the coming years, and so will the need for disaster relief programs and programs designed to mitigate damage. But even when those programs work as designed, NPR has found that inequality persists.
More than 1,500 miles northeast of Houston, two towns show how disaster relief efforts are determined and who wins and who loses in the calculation.
Manville, N.J., an hour outside Manhattan, has flooded repeatedly since the 1970s. On a recent tour, Superintendent of Schools Robert Beers drove over a bridge and into a neighborhood called Lost Valley, a suburban enclave of Cape Cod-style homes built in a compact grid along the Raritan River.
The numbers spray-painted on the front of this house in the Lost Valley neighborhood in Manville, N.J., indicate that it was bought as part of a federal disaster program. The program uses federal and local money to purchase houses that have flooded multiple times and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""This area was hit the hardest,"" he says. ""And as we drive through you're going to be able to see a lot of vacant homes, and areas that were bulldozed. Some of these open, these vacant lots here, there were homes here.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. A drop in household incomes followed, and home values lagged behind nearby towns.
""After the first flood, people began thinking, 'Is it time to get out?' "" says Eleanor Nieliwocki, who lived in Lost Valley for more than 30 years. ""After the second flood, not again. And the third flood, we've had it."" She finalized the sale of her house to a government buyout in 2015.
""We've had to cut programs; class sizes have grown; and, quite frankly, we haven't been able to offer the supports that our students so desperately need,"" said Robert Beers, the superintendent of Manville School District.
Claire Harbage/NPR
And buyouts like Nieliwocki's matter to Beers. All those vacant lots affect how much money his schools get. Fewer homes overall mean less tax revenue to fund education. Last year, Manville's public school system found itself battling large budget shortfalls. At the same time, Beers says, the schools faced new demands: Since 1999's Hurricane Floyd, Manville's Hispanic population had risen from 5 percent to 23 percent.
""Nearly 30 percent of our students speak only Spanish at home, so we need to fund additional positions to transition these children and provide them with the services they need,"" Beers said last spring. (By summer, after an intense lobbying effort, Beers was able to get the state government to increase funding for Manville's schools.)
And even though the buyouts in Manville hurt the tax base, FEMA says the strategy actually saves money in the long run. The agency says for every dollar spent on buyouts and other hazard mitigation programs, federal taxpayers save $6 in future disaster losses. The agency has allocated more than $15 billion on those strategies since 1989.
Students walk through the hallways of Manville High School between class periods. Fewer homes have meant fewer tax dollars to fund education, and the public school system has found itself battling large budget shortfalls.

""I think our program is achieving in Manville what it's intended to achieve,"" says Maurstad, who oversees FEMA's buyout program. He says FEMA is meeting its goals if it makes a community less risky, saves property and potentially saves lives.
And he points out that while FEMA pays 75 percent of the cost to buy out homes in disaster-prone areas, states and localities decide where they want those buyouts to occur, so demographic changes aren't on the federal agency's radar.
""I'm not aware that there's been a specific study by FEMA or anyone else on the demographic distribution of [the buyout] approach,"" says Maurstad. ""But the approach itself is not one that would necessarily, intentionally lead to those outcomes.""

Reeling from repeated floods, Manville asked the Army Corps of Engineers to build a flood control system to protect it. In 2016, the Corps said no.
Catherine Kling, an economist at Cornell University, studies the kind of benefit-cost analysis the Corps does to decide which property is worth saving. ""The whole idea of a benefit-cost analysis is actually very simple,"" Kling says. ""It simply seeks to answer the question: If we do this project, is the total value from this project greater than the total costs?""
That means that protecting 10 families in $1 million houses has the same value as protecting 100 families in $100,000 houses.
In Manville, the Corps counted about 500 homes and businesses in flood zones and said it could protect them for about $67 million. But for every dollar spent on the project, only 40 cents' worth of property would be saved. Under federal guidelines, that's not enough.
""It is completely agnostic as to who receives those benefits and those costs,"" says Kling. And, she says, economists assume the people displaced and the economic activity they generate will simply move somewhere else.

Still, even if the approach is designed to avoid picking winners and losers, it ends up doing so anyway, favoring wealthier neighborhoods. ""It's also going to be [choosing] more valuable businesses,"" Kling says. ""More valuable real estate.""
Indeed, if there were a climate change lottery with public funding as the prize, you could say Bound Brook, N.J., just 4 miles from Manville, hit the jackpot: a sweeping, $650 million flood control project whose local portion was completed in 2016. Developers followed, investing tens of millions of dollars.
In Bound Brook, on a very different tour around town last summer, Councilman Abel Gomez detailed plans for hundreds of upscale apartments, new restaurants and an expanded Main Street. ""Without flood control,"" he said, ""you were always the next natural disaster before you were wiped out.""

But some residents worry how they will afford to live there once the new projects are completed. Bound Brook has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Costa Ricans enough that the country's president visited in 2014 and a history of alleged housing discrimination. The Justice Department sued the town in 2004, saying its housing policies discriminated against Latinos, and for years its housing and development practices were regulated by a consent decree. In 2017, a local government analysis found that households in the most heavily Latino neighborhoods had lower incomes and spent a greater portion of their incomes on housing than those in the majority-white area.
Some of the newer apartments are already renting for hundreds more than the town's median rent.
Francisco Morales Mora, who emigrated from Costa Rica in 1994 and owns a restaurant downtown, says that's too much. ""The people of Bound Brook are poor,"" he says. ""And unless the new [apartments] are cheaper, people will leave.""
Francisco Morales Mora, a Costa Rican immigrant, owns a restaurant called Frank's in downtown Bound Brook. Morales says more development in town, fueled by feelings of relative safety from floods, will be good for business and make the town more vibrant. But he worries about affordability.

Robert Greco, the project's manager for the Corps, says the flood control project in and around Bound Brook protects a highly dense area with a range of income levels. He says it isn't intended to favor the wealthy but acknowledges that the project is changing the area.
""The Borough of Bound Brook is not wealthy,"" Greco says. ""But guess what, now they're building and the economic vitality is picking up, and it's beautiful, actually.""
Pressed on what the new, expensive development plan might mean for the Latino community, Gomez, the councilman, says, ""We really, really hope that the Latino identity that's here remains here. ... Because that's key to this. It sets us apart.""

The bigger picture around the country is that some Americans will be more vulnerable and some will be more resilient in the face of climate change. And who wins and who loses appears to mirror existing inequalities.
""Hardworking Americans who are working class are going to find their communities stressed even more than they are now,"" says Andrew Light, an editor of the 2018 National Climate Assessment. ""If you're already a community at risk, you're going to be at more risk.""
In Houston, the Papadopouloses have applied for a buyout and are likely to be offered one if they wait long enough. It may take years. 
Janice Perry-Evans and her family are still in their rental but, ""It is really a struggle now to stay afloat,"" she says. She plans to file for bankruptcy.
And in Manville, even as the Army Corps of Engineers declined to build a flood control project, it predicted that ""significant flooding can result in municipal infrastructure damage, loss of jobs, and closure of businesses,"" as well as ""continued potential for loss of life.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. This house in Lost Valley was bought out.

Megan Geuss,"Enlarge / GILLETTE, Wyo.: A truck loaded with coal is viewed from the Eagle Butte Coal Mine Overlook which is operated by Alpha Coal. The area is a large producer of coal. Gillette uses the moniker of ""The Energy Capital of the Nation"". (Photo by reader comments 2 On Wednesday, Wyoming's Land Quality Advisory Board voted to limit so-called ""self-bonding"" in the state, a practice that allows coal and other mining companies to avoid putting up any collateral to reclaim land when the company is done with the mine. The new proposed rules will go through a public comment period and then need to be signed by the governor of the state to take effect, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. The board's passage of the proposed rules is somewhat surprising in a coal-heavy state, because it could potentially raise the cost of coal mining in Wyoming for some companies. However, there is political support for more stringent environmental rules after a number of coal companies filed for bankruptcy in recent years. Although no companies ended up abandoning mine cleanup to the state, the specter of hundreds of millions of dollars of cleanup in the event of another coal downturn has left regulators eager to limit how much damage the state could be on the hook for. The five-person advisory board voted 4-1 in favor of limiting self-bonding. The board member who voted against limits to self-bonding works for Peabody Energy, a major coal producer in the state. The limits wouldn't do away with self-bonding in Wyoming. Instead, to qualify for self-bonding, a coal company would have to have a strong credit-rating and would be expected to run the mine for at least five more years. The Star-Tribune notes that credit ratings for coal firms also factor in the health of the market, so the state of Wyoming wouldn't have to independently evaluate the larger economic risks to a mine going under. If a company doesn't qualify for self-bonding, it could still open a coal mine, but it would have to purchase some sort of surety bond or collateral bond to pay for mine reclamation after the mine has reached the end of its life, according to the US Department of the Interior (DOI). That requirement would increase the cost of starting a new mine, compared to a coal-mining company simply showing the state its financial statements under self-bonding. Wyoming's proposed amendments to its self-bonding rules are long in the making. In March, the Land Quality Advisory Board reviewed similar restrictions on the practice, but, amid pressure from major coal companies, the board sent the rules back to legislators to rewrite. The proposal that the Board passed this week seems to be only mildly less stringent than its March predecessor, which required 10 years of mine life left to self-bond instead of five, in addition to a strong credit-rating. Wyoming is not the only state that allows self-bonding for mining companies. In fact, 19 states allow it, and of those, 10 states plus the Navajo Nation currently host self-bonded surface-mining operations, the DOI notes. But the financial troubles of the coal-mining industry have highlighted the risks involved with self-bonding in a way that previous operations have not. At a federal level, self-bonding is not illegal, and the US government has largely allowed states to legislate the matter as they see fit. In April, however, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the federal government end its tacit approval of self-bonding.",Legislators are eager to avoid financial disaster if coal companies default again.,2018-09-20T21:20:14Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","As coal stalls, Wyoming considers new environmental-protection rules",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/wyoming-proposes-making-cleanup-funding-rules-stricter-for-coal-companies/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-691404934-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,disaster,1
Adam Clark Estes,"Software updates are exciting. I keep telling my friends this, and when they get behind on their updates, I’m all, “Hey, you’re missing out on good stuff!” This is part of the reason why I’m sometimes the guy who downloads beta versions of software. The bugs are annoying, but hey, the features are better. This approach recently backfired on me with macOS and iOS 12. Unexpectedly, I think the resulting disaster made me a better computer user. It’s honestly a really stupid story. (Emphasis on “stupid” and also emphasis on me being the stupid one.) After seeing several coworkers running the beta version of macOS Mojave and looking super cool with the new dark mode, I decided I had to have it. And while I was at it, why not join the public beta for iOS 12 and see what that was all about? Because you should always pivot from dependable software to unpredictable adventures when your daily life depends on it. Definitely do it with the laptop and phone you use every day! Again, I did a dumb thing, but I learned a lesson from it. Within 24 hours of downloading macOS Mojave and iOS 12 onto my primary laptop and phone, my world was turned upside down. I didn’t receive notifications properly on my phone any more, and I couldn’t send text messages. My laptop wouldn’t connect to wifi on a regular basis. Battery life was a gut-punching tragedy. And it was my fault. It was also a little bit Apple’s fault, says my vindictive side. For the sake of learning lessons, though, let’s look at all this mess from a historical perspective and see if we can make sense of anything. This isn’t the first time Downloading beta versions of integral operating systems is not a new thing for me. A few years ago, I did my first Gizmodo review: an anguished tome about iOS 7. It was a silly thing to review, since most people would eventually upgrade their iPhone software out of necessity, but I think my editor was trying to ease me into the waters of Gizmodo reviews as gently as possible. “Download the developer beta,” he told me, “and check out the new features.” It felt thrilling at the time. I quickly realized why anyone who knows anything about software discourages non-developers from using betas on a regular basis. At the very least, wise computer users will tell you that you should never download beta versions of operating systems on your primary computer or smartphone. The software is called beta for a reason! Beta versions are unfinished, full of bugs, and guaranteed to be unpredictable. If you’re really curious about how the new iOS works, install it on your old phone and save yourself some heartache. When I did the iOS 7 review, I only had one iPhone. I was also somehow dumber than I am today, so I signed up for a developer account, nuked my trusty iOS 6, and dove headfirst in the glorious, new, flat design. I’d go out to bars, hoping someone would see how different my iPhone looked and ask me how I did it. (No one ever did.) During work hours, I would miss emails, tear through my battery by 10am, and struggle to stay sane. The review turned out fine, I think, and I swore never to do it again. Until iOS 8 came out, and I did it again. That time, though, I had an old phone and followed the advice of the sage developers. I followed that pattern for the next several versions. Then, this year happened. Thanks to a clumsy friend, my backup phone got destroyed a few months ago, so I’ve been depending solely on my iPhone X. My backup computer also bit the dust, so my primary machine is a work laptop. Given what I’ve just said about only loading beta operating systems onto backup phones and computers, you’d think that I would skip this year’s public beta. I did not. A week ago, I downloaded both of them at once and felt proud of myself for being bold. That feeling lasted less than a day. This isn’t the worst time, either It turns out iOS 12 isn’t much different than iOS 11. We knew this would be the case a while back when reports suggested that the next version of Apple’s mobile software would focus on stability and clean up the buggy mess that was its previous version. Similarly, macOS Mojave is a gentle upgrade at best. Aside from the new dark mode, many of the improvements can only be spotted when you’re looking for them. They’re great—I really like the quick editing options macOS Mojave lets you do in Finder—but there’s nothing I couldn’t live without. Like I said before, the primary motivating factor for my joining the public beta program was to get the dark mode. It is, as I’d hoped, dark and, as a result, deeply badass. The bugs in these early version of macOS Mojave and iOS 12 are not badass. They’re awful. As I write this post, I’m using my iPhone as a hotspot because my Mojave-powered laptop will only connect to wifi sometimes, and I’m about to lose my mind, because my company’s security software clearly hasn’t been updated for macOS Mojave and is freaking out as a result. Meanwhile, my iPhone is about to die, even though it was fully charged about 90 minutes ago. I still can’t receive most text messages, and my contact list seems to nuke itself at will, so even if I do get one, I usually have no idea who sent it. These kinds of bugs reminded me of my earlier forays into beta versions of Apple’s operating systems, although the problems weren’t as catastrophic as some I’ve encountered in the past. I could honestly deal with a lot of these annoyances, if Apple offered an exceptionally better experience in this new software. While I do believe the new versions of macOS and iOS are better than their predecessors, there’s nothing mind-blowing, at least not in the way that iOS 7 and its slick design was mind-blowing so many years ago. Sure, macOS Mojave has dark mode, but half of my other software doesn’t yet support it. Meanwhile, iOS 12 promises some cool innovations with Siri Shortcuts and ARKit 2, but those platforms need third party apps to make the features shine. Those apps won’t be available until the official release. It seems like Memoji is the splashiest new thing available in the iOS 12 public beta, so far. Which is gross. The really tricky thing about using with early beta software—especially an operating system—is that some bugs rear their ugly heads at the weirdest times. Some of them, like that messaging one I mentioned above, are fixable. (It’s an iMessage bug, and all you have to do is completely sign out of iCloud on your iOS device and sign back in.) The wifi issue also isn’t the end of the world. (It has to do with public wifi networks, and there’s a specific webpage you can visit in Safari to skirt around the problem.) The trouble with my company-specific software, unfortunately, won’t go away. This headache mainly amounts to getting a lot of random pop-ups throughout the day which is annoying at best. At worst, my computer is slightly less secure than it was when I was running the official release of macOS High Sierra. So after a week of suffering, I decided to turn back. The new-ish public beta programs come with a sort of handy rip cord that lets you unenroll in the public beta. If you don’t like the glitchy software, you can delete your public beta profile, put your device in recovery mode, and restore your device from the backup you were supposed to make before installing the public beta. Apple even built a handy little website to walk you through the process. Problem is, the macOS backup only works if you use Time Machine. I back everything up with Google Drive, so that was useless. But since macOS Mojave isn’t all that buggy, I decided to live with it. Getting out of iOS 12 was harder than I thought. Luckily, I did back up my iPhone through iTunes. So I erased it and went for the full restore, excited to get back to my crappy old iOS 11 experience. Unfortunately, the macOS Mojave beta version of iTunes wouldn’t recognize my phone, so I couldn’t restore it that way. Thanks to a slew of adaptors and some deep digging in the mobile backup folder in Finder, I got the backup file and restored it from a different computer. Well, first I just simply wiped and restored the device without putting it in recovery mode first. This simply restored the iPhone from the backup but did not get rid of iOS 12. To do that, you have to put your device in recovery mode before you restore from the backup. It took—I’m not exaggerating—an entire day to accomplish this. There won’t be a next time After many wasted hours tinkering with this unfinished software, I’m done. My iPhone is basically back to normal, minus a few days of lost data. My MacBook Pro is a bit of a flickering mess, but I’ll deal with it. (At least it didn’t turn blue, like my coworker’s did.) Me, I’m a bit embarrassed. All of the inconveniences that come with using beta software for my daily life were completely avoidable, and I knew it. Apple is also very careful to express you should be prepared for bugs, and you should absolutely back everything up before you start. This got me thinking hard about how I used computers these days. I’m frankly a little overconfident sometimes. While I take pride in fixing problems myself and even doing basic hardware repairs, I’m not a developer. I honestly don’t have any business spotting bugs for Apple, especially when I’m just using my iPhone and my MacBook to keep in touch with friends and do my job. And also, I suck at following instructions. I didn’t backup my MacBook when Apple told me to, and that was almost as stupid as thinking I needed dark mode immediately. So I’m stuck. I’m stuck with this beta version of macOS until the fall when the official release will drop. I’m stuck with the bugs, and I’m stuck with the frustration. If there’s a silver lining to any of this, it’s the simple fact that I will not make this mistake again. I’ll stop thinking I’m some kind of super user and that I’m capable of using half-finished software for the fun of it. I’ll even be better about backing up my devices in the ways that Apple wants me to, in case I ever do need to restore them. I might even be a better computer user one day. Doubt I’ll ever recover from being a dumbass, though.","Software updates are exciting. I keep telling my friends this, and when they get behind on their updates, I’m all, “Hey, you’re missing out on good stuff!” This is part of the reason why I’m sometimes the guy who downloads beta versions of software.

Reuters Editorial,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela arrested five state police officials for their alleged role in a riot and fire that killed 68 people in an overcrowded police station cell, the country’s public prosecutor said on Saturday. “The prosecutor’s office has issued arrest warrants for five officials of PoliCarabobo who have been signaled as responsible for the tragic incident that led to the death of 68 citizens in the cells of the headquarters of said regional police: THEY HAVE BEEN DETAINED #Justice,” tweeted prosecutor Tarek Saab. Saab, a former Socialist Party governor close to leftist President Nicolas Maduro, did not provide any further details on the cause of the disaster, the worst to affect Venezuela’s notoriously violent jails in over two decades. Relatives of dead inmates and one surviving prisoner told Reuters there was a shoot-out with police on Wednesday morning in the jail in Carabobo state capital Valencia. One inmate’s widow said officials had doused the area with gasoline, which fueled a fire through the small cells strung with hammocks and divided with sheets. There was no immediate comment from Carabobo state police. Venezuela’s opposition blames the tragedy on Maduro’s inability to reform Venezuela’s lawless jails, where inmates strut around with weapons and orchestrate crimes from cells. “The situation in detention centers and police jail cells in Venezuela is unacceptable!” said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro. Opposition politicians have also criticized the government for its long silence about the incident. Maduro’s administration only issued a statement late on Friday night expressing its condolences to relatives and the president has yet to publicly speak about the deaths. A former bus driver and union leader who has grown widely unpopular, Maduro is running for re-election in a May election largely boycotted by the opposition. With heavy use of state resources and a compliant electoral council, he is expected to win a six-year term despite salary-destroying hyperinflation, a fifth straight year of recession, and rampant crime. State television focused on showing images of Venezuelans on the beach during the Easter holiday, while Maduro’s ministers also largely remained mum on the Valencia disaster. But Delcy Rodriguez, the president of the pro-government legislative super body known as the constituent assembly, struck back at criticism of the government’s handling of the jail fire. “We repudiate the use of Venezuelans’ pain as a political tool,” tweeted Rodriguez.

Shannon Connellan,"James Franco was pressed for answers by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show on Tuesday, following accusations of sexual misconduct since his Golden Globe win. The Disaster Artist star was interviewed by the talk show host, broadcast mere hours after The New York Times cancelled a TimesTalks event with Franco scheduled for Wednesday. SEE ALSO: Seth Meyers slays Golden Globes monologue then gives women the mic A public supporter of the Time's Up movement against systemic sexual abuse in Hollywood and other industries, Franco wore one of the widely publicized pins to the Globes on Sunday. But during and after the ceremony, in which Franco won a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in The Disaster Artist, several women posted accusations of sexual misconduct on Twitter. Tweets included those of The Breakfast Club actor Ally Sheedy, who Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway play. She wrote in now-deleted tweets, “James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,"" then posted #MeToo at the end of another tweet. Actress Violet Paley claimed that Franco had tried to force her to perform oral sex, tweeting that, ""A couple weeks ago, James offered me &amp; a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone “apology”. I don’t accept."" Cute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis &amp; that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old? — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018 Colbert asked Franco about these accusations of sexual misconduct on the Late Show. “First, I want to say I do support it,"" said Franco, speaking of the Time's Up and #MeToo movements. ""Look, I was so excited to win but being in that room that night was incredible. It was powerful, and there were incredible voices and I support it, I support change."" ""There were some things on Twitter, I haven’t read them. I’ve heard about them,"" he said, turning his attention to the accusations against him. ""OK, first of all, I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy. I directed her in a play off-Broadway. I had nothing but a great time with her. Total respect for her. I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweet down, I don't know, I can’t speak for her."" ""The others, look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I’ve done. I have to to that to maintain my wellbeing. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed. I make it a point to do it."" ""The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long. So, I don’t want to shut them down in anyway. It's, I think, a good thing and I support it."" Colbert asked Franco whether there was some way to have the discussion that wasn't held on social media, and whether there could be some kind of reconciliation for two people who have different views of a situation. “If there’s restitution to be made, I will make it. So, if I’ve done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to. I mean, I think that's how that works. I don’t know what else to do. ""As far as the bigger issues, you know, how we do it, look, I really don’t have the answers and I think the point of this whole thing is that we listen.

Victoria Rodriguez,"Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday and then weakened as it moved through Georgia. Now designated a tropical storm, Michael is headed toward North and South Carolina, which were both recently devastated by Hurricane Florence. SEE ALSO: Photos show widespread destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael Although the full scope of the damage is still being evaluated, preliminary reports have included power outages, uprooted trees, flooding, and demolished homes. At least six people have died as a result of the hurricane. CoreLogic, a financial data company, estimates insured storm losses could reach $4.5 billion. Recovery work has started in Florida, so if you'd like to help the survivors there and in Georgia, here's our list of ways you can provide support: 1. Donate to disaster-relief organizations. The nonprofit Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities, compiled a list of organizations providing general aid and relief, as well as food, shelter, medical care, and other necessities. If you want to ensure that your donation goes directly to Hurricane Michael relief, check first with the nonprofit about how they earmark financial gifts. Here are the organizations listed by Charity Navigator: GlobalGiving, International Relief Teams, International Medical Corps, Save the Children, Direct Relief, American Kidney Fund, DonorsChoose.org, World Help, American Red Cross, LeSea Global Feed the Hungry, SBP, Americares, Good360, World Hope International, First Book, Christian Relief Fund, World Vision, Matthew 25: Ministries, Heart to Heart International, Catholic Charities Diocese of St. Petersburg, Big Cat Rescue, Feeding the Gulf Coast, and Feeding Tampa Bay. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Habitat for Humanity is taking donations to carry out their recovery plan following the storm. Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, which receives donations, is working to assist people with disabilities, older adults, and other people with access and functional needs. 2. Help provide emergency supplies. Several of the above organizations are focused on meeting the urgent need for food, water, clothing, and shelter. World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, is delivering supplies, such as food, hygiene kits, clean water, blankets, diapers, and other personal care items to those affected and displaced by Hurricane Michael. You can donate here. Global Giving, an international crowdfunding community that supports local nonprofits, launched a Hurricane Michael relief fund to provide emergency supplies as well as long-term assistance. 3. Donate to GoFundMe campaigns. GoFundMe has created a general relief fund to raise $50,000. The funds will be managed by The Direct Impact Fund, an independent nonprofit that distributes funds to verified campaigns and aid organizations. GoFundMe has also created a hub for verified individual campaigns related to Michael. If you're looking for additional resources on how to assess nonprofits and their work providing relief aid, consider consulting Charity Navigator or other charity watchdogs, like GuideStar, Charity Watch, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.","Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press.

Andy Sullivan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida last September, the top U.S. disaster-response official ordered all hands on deck. With 4,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers already helping survivors of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, FEMA chief Brock Long told managers in an internal memo to ready every member of the agency’s on-call reservist workforce for deployment. In the following months, thousands of FEMA reservists, who account for about half of the agency’s disaster-response personnel, would descend on Florida, Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere to help recovery efforts after an unprecedented string of natural disasters. But not all would respond. About 500 reservists, or one of every twelve workers, ignored FEMA’s deployment request, current and former officials told Reuters. “We didn’t even hear from them,” Patrick Hernandez, who oversees FEMA’s disaster workforce, said in an interview. “We need to get people in here who understand the system and adhere to the protocols.” With the 2018 hurricane season already underway, FEMA is scrambling to hire more people who are willing to depart at a moment’s notice for assignments that can last months at a stretch. Internal documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the agency's disaster-response force is understaffed by 26 percent. And as last year revealed, many of those who sign up don't always respond when needed. (For graphic, see tmsnrt.rs/2Juw4LV ) That comes at a cost. At times, staffing shortages force FEMA to shuffle personnel from one disaster to the next and in some cases rely on workers who do not know how to do the job effectively, according to interviews with 15 current and former FEMA workers. Some local officials say the agency’s central mission - getting federal aid where it is needed - is undercut by the constant turnover. “They had no knowledge of the system. They had no knowledge about how to do anything but fill out forms,” said Junior Shelton, mayor of Central, Louisiana, which experienced catastrophic flooding in 2016. “We’re still sitting around waiting for that money to get here.” Hernandez said staffing issues have not affected FEMA’s ability to get the job done. “I would not agree with that statement wholeheartedly,” he said. Help wanted at FEMA: tmsnrt.rs/2Jxn6O1 ‘A VERY LOW NUMBER’ The extraordinary string of domestic disasters in 2017 continues to weigh on the U.S. agency. With thousands of workers still out in the field, official figures show that 33 percent of FEMA’s disaster-response workforce is available for deployment, down from 56 percent at this time last year. Some specialties are stretched especially thin: Only 13 percent of the workers who direct federal aid to pay for rebuilding costs after a disaster hits are currently available. “That’s a very low number, and that would be very scary going into more disasters,” said Elizabeth Zimmerman, a former senior FEMA official. Unlike military reservists, those who work for FEMA don’t have a guarantee that their regular jobs will be available when they return home. As a result, most are retirees who don’t need steady work or recent college graduates who don’t yet have a full-time job, current and former managers say. Reservists are allowed to turn down up to three assignments each year, meaning FEMA cannot count on a full reserve force during peak periods. According to internal figures, FEMA’s reservist corps has grown by roughly 1,000 workers over the past year. Still, it remains 3,700 workers short of the 10,949 reservists it has determined it needs to be able to respond to several disasters at once. Some reservists say they are not in a position to accept months-long assignments far from their homes. “I could get a phone call tomorrow telling me to go to Puerto Rico, but the truth is I’m not going to go,” said Alessandra Jerolleman, who said family obligations prevent her from leaving Louisiana. FEMA officials point out they can pull in other types of workers when needed. Some 22,000 federal employees from agencies like the Defense Department participated in disaster-relief work with FEMA in 2017, for example. “We rely on our reservists and we love them,” said FEMA’s Hernandez. “But FEMA’s made up of a lot of different elements.” SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS FEMA also hires residents of disaster zones to help out, a practice that is widely praised for boosting employment and harnessing local knowledge. But some say it can hinder FEMA’s effectiveness. Carlos Mercader, Puerto Rico’s top lobbyist in Washington, said he received numerous complaints of poorly trained FEMA workers who assess damaged houses in a seemingly arbitrary manner. While one might be declared a total loss, another that appeared to suffer similar damage might be denied reconstruction assistance, he said. Local hires accounted for more than half of the 2,878 FEMA employees in Puerto Rico in May, according to agency figures obtained by Reuters. Only 100 are permanent FEMA employees. “They probably should be sending us more people with as much experience as possible,” Mercader said. FEMA officials say Congress could help with recruiting and retaining reservists by guaranteeing they can keep their regular jobs while on assignment, as is the case with military reservists. Officials have also asked Congress to change hiring laws to give reservists preferential status when they apply for a full-time FEMA job. Congress has yet to act on those requests. But FEMA’s own actions may also drive away some who are willing to serve, reservists say. Paul Seldes, 59, said he tried unsuccessfully since 2011 to find an assignment that matched his background in field operations. Instead, the agency repeatedly asked him to report to a telephone call center to screen financial-aid requests from disaster survivors. By last fall, he no longer bothered to respond to such deployment requests, he said. “I have this capability, I have this knowledge, I have this training - why don’t you want to listen to me?” he said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption A symbol of hope or bad PR for Fukushima? Fukushima residents have reacted angrily to the statue of a boy in protective gear, saying it gives the impression of a city still contaminated after the 2011 nuclear disaster. Fukushima's nuclear plant was hit by a tsunami in 2011, causing the most serious such accident since Chernobyl. The statue was erected in early August and its creator said it was about hope for a world free from nuclear disaster. Artist Kenji Yanobe has since apologised for making residents uneasy. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo, angry citizens took to Twitter and called the authorities directly, demanding for the statue to be removed as it would harm the reputation of Fukushima. The statue is named ""Sun Child"" and can be found outside Fukushima's train station. It depicts a boy wearing a yellow hazmat suit, holding his helmet in one hand and a sun symbol in the other. A monitor counter on his chest displays the numbers ""000"" to show there is no radiation. ""I wanted to make a work that encourages people… and made the statue of a child standing up bravely and strongly against any difficulties it faces,"" Mr Yanobe said, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo. Image copyright AFP Image caption The nuclear plant remains contaminated and in ruins The 2011 Fukushima disaster saw three reactors of the nuclear power plant, some 100km (62 miles) southeast of the city of Fukushima, fail after it was damaged and flooded in the tsunami. The accident forced more than 200,000 people to leave their homes because of nuclear contamination concerns. More than 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown. Parts of the damaged reactors are still highly contaminated but most of the prefecture has been declared safe again. The artist Mr Yanobe said he ""should have paid more attention to the fact that accurate knowledge about radiation is needed much more now than before the disaster"". Image copyright AFP He also said he wanted to discuss the future of his statue with the city. The city's mayor defended the decision to put up the statue, arguing it had been well received at exhibitions in Japan and around the world before it was installed permanently in Fukushima. On Twitter he called for understanding saying that unlike science, contemporary art was abstract.","For angry Fukushima residents, the statue gives the impression of a city still contaminated.",2018-08-14T06:36:52Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fukushima child statue: Residents complain about radiation suit,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45179095,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42DC/production/_102961171_044df30c-44db-4682-a84b-295ac0cde9df.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,disaster,1

Gram Slattery,"BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Residents of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais reacted with indifference and in many cases dismissal at a raft of measures mining giant Vale SA pledged to adopt in recent days in the wake of a dam burst that likely killed over 300 people. 
“Too Late” read the newspaper of record here, O Estado de Minas, after Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, said it would take up to 10 percent of its production offline and spend 5 billion reais ($1.36 billion) to decommission 10 dams like the one that collapsed at its Corrego do Feijao mine on Friday. 
With some 99 people confirmed dead and another 250 missing, according to firefighters, the tailings dam collapse in the town of Brumadinho may be Brazil’s deadliest ever mine disaster. In recent days, Vale has vowed to keep paying taxes on the paralyze mine and donate 100,000 reais to the family of each victim. 
The initiatives were either little talked about, or derided in this pastoral region, whose residents are in many cases still in shock. 
At the local union on a side street in the devastated town of Brumadinho, one union official still had not heard of Vale’s plan, while another said it was an issue on the back burner. 
“Honestly, we’re just absorbing what happened,” said Neftali Goncalves da Silva, the union’s vice president. “Vale will come here and we’ll talk, but for now we’re just recovering.” 
On Wednesday, United Nations human rights experts weighed in, urging an official investigation into the incident. Federal and state prosecutors have already said they are a seeking to make the matter a criminal case. 
Along the massive mudslide that was once part of the hamlet of Corrego do Feijao, from which the mine takes its name, residents concentrated on trying to put their lives back in order. 
“The focus of everything is looking for my brother,” said Pedro Ferreira dos Santos, as he dug into the dirt, looking for his sibling’s body. 
“My greatest desire is that he be found.”

MARTIN FACKLER,"A Tepco guide explained this was because the central plant grounds had been deforested and paved over, sealing in contaminated soil. During a recent visit, the mood within the plant was noticeably more relaxed, though movements were still tightly controlled and everyone was required to wear radiation-measuring badges. Inside a “resting building,” workers ate in a large cafeteria and bought snacks in a convenience store. At the plant’s entrance, a sign warned: “Games like Pokemon GO are forbidden within the facility.” “We have finished the debris cleanup and gotten the plant under control,” said the guide, Daisuke Hirose, a spokesman for Tepco’s subsidiary in charge of decommissioning the plant. “Now, we are finally preparing for decommissioning.” In September, the prime minister’s office set a target date of 2021 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — for the next significant stage, when workers begin extracting the melted fuel from at least one of the three destroyed reactors, though they have yet to choose which one. The government admits that cleaning up the plant will take at least another three to four decades and tens of billions of dollars. A $100 million research center has been built nearby to help scientists and engineers develop a new generation of robots to enter the reactor buildings and scoop up the melted fuel. At Chernobyl, the Soviets simply entombed the charred reactor in concrete after the deadly 1986 accident. But Japan has pledged to dismantle the Fukushima plant and decontaminate the surrounding countryside, which was home to about 160,000 people who were evacuated after accident. Many of them have been allowed to return as the rural towns around the plant have been decontaminated. But without at least starting a cleanup of the plant itself, officials admit they will find it difficult to convince the public that the accident is truly over. They also hope that beginning the cleanup will help them win the public’s consent to restart Japan’s undamaged nuclear plants, most of which remain shut down since the disaster. Tepco and the government are treading cautiously to avoid further mishaps that could raise doubts that the plant is under control. “They are being very methodical — too slow, some would say — in making a careful effort to avoid any missteps or nasty surprises,” said David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was a co-author of a book on the disaster. “They want to regain trust. They have learned that trust can be lost much quicker than it can be recovered.” Continue reading the main story","Daisuke Hirose, a Tepco spokesman, inside the Unit 5 reactor at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

Tom McKay,"Electronic Art’s Star Wars Battlefront II, one of the biggest video game titles of the year, debuted to disaster in recent weeks after both consumers and the gaming press revolted against the $60 game’s reliance on microtransaction-fueled, pay-to-win loot boxes. At launch, the title prevented players from accessing key features of the game like playing as Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader without either grueling grinds or shelling out extra cash to help bypass its confusing internal economy. Crucially, some elements of the system like loot box contents were randomized—meaning even players who chose to give EA more money could still walk away frustrated. Last week, the Belgian Gaming Commission reportedly launched an investigation into whether the system constituted a violation of gambling laws. According to PC Gamer and VTM Nieuws, the commission’s decision is clear: It considers inserting randomized pay-to-win schemes into video games as equivalent to the “mixing of money and addiction” and thus a form of gambling like video slot machines. Belgian Minister of Justice Koen Geens added, “Mixing gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.” He noted that Belgium would have to work through the European Union’s process to achieve a total ban. This has potentially huge ramifications for the video game industry, which has seen some of its biggest players turn to milking players for micro-transaction revenue even after they’ve shelled out money for the original product. The Belgian ruling doesn’t address that issue directly—consumers would still be allowed to pay for specific bonuses or items—but it does suggest that the trend is starting to become abusive enough that regulators are setting limits to how far it can extend its grimy tentacles. It’s also likely to be particularly embarrassing for EA, which has already seen such an incredible backlash to Battlefront II’s model that it’s in the uncomfortable position of tanking a flagship Star Wars game in the middle of a rebooted franchise. While gamers are notoriously rabid opponents of government infringement on the industry, it’s hard to see them sticking their nose up at this one.

Catie Keck,"The release of a damning report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week predicting unprecedented climate disaster within the next decade was no doubt a sobering reminder of the fragile state of our planet. But new forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the future of global renewable energy capacity offers a far more hopeful picture, predicting a massive spike in clean energy over the next five years if, that is, necessary policy and regulation are acted upon now. In an October 8 press release on its Renewables 2018 report, the IEA highlighted modern bioenergy which the International Renewable Energy Agency describes as including liquid biofuels produced from plants, biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, and wood pellet heating systems, which is of particular importance for industries as having the potential for the greatest growth in renewable resources between now and 2023. The IEA also noted the importance of modern bioenergy in developing a robust renewable portfolio and ensuring a more secure and sustainable energy system. Modern bioenergy is the overlooked giant of the renewable energy field, the IEAs executive director Dr. Fatih Birol said in a statement. Its share in the worlds total renewables consumption is about 50% today, in other words as much as hydro, wind, solar and all other renewables combined. We expect modern bioenergy will continue to lead the field, and has huge prospects for further growth. Whats more, Bloomberg reported Sunday that one forecast scenario from the report could see as much as an extra 1.3 terawatts of clean energy being installed by 2023. Part of this predicted renewable energy boom is thanks to solar power, for which the Renewables report states: Solar PV capacity is forecast to expand by almost 600 GW more than all other renewable power technologies combined, or as much as twice Japans total capacity, reaching 1 terawatt (TW) by the end of the forecast period. Despite recent policy changes, China remains the absolute solar PV leader by far, holding almost 40% of global installed PV capacity in 2023. The United States remains the second-largest growth market for solar PV, followed by India, whose capacity quadruples. [ sic ] If all this sounds great, the report does underscore the importance of appropriate policies and market design as paramount to the success of continued renewable energy growth. As Birol noted in his statement on the report, [T]he right policies and rigorous sustainability regulations will be essential to meet its full potential. Gizmodo reached out to IEA for comment and will update this report should we hear back.

Brendan M. Egan,"Launching a startup takes courage -- and cash. About one-third of new businesses fail within their first two years, and about 50 percent of new businesses are no longer around after the five-year mark. Why? According to U.S. Bank, it is estimated that 82 percent of businesses that don’t make it fail because of cash flow problems. It’s no secret that it takes a significant amount of money to launch and operate a startup. But sometimes, entrepreneurs underestimate how much they will need to cover their expenses. Here’s a look at the top five expenses that startup founders fear the most. Related: 6 Entrepreneurs Share the Brilliant, Crazy Ways They Took Their Companies From Pennies to Profit 1. Legal fees Entrepreneurs will need a lawyer to assist with a number of different legal matters. For example, lawyers can assist with the formation and incorporation of your business. Lawyers can also help entrepreneurs protect the intellectual property that the company relies on to do business. Lawyers are invaluable assets who can help entrepreneurs overcome legal obstacles on their path to success. But unfortunately, their services do not come cheap. Legal fees can add up quickly, so this is an expense that every entrepreneur fears. To save on legal, consider researching online templates and documents that can give you a head start on your legal planning. Things like operating agreements, form contracts and terms of service can all be found online by doing a quick Google search. Get these documents to where you feel they are 90 percent of what you need, then bring on a lawyer to bring things to the finish line. 2. Taxes Entrepreneurs are usually well aware that they will have to pay taxes, but they may be surprised by the amount they will have to pay. Even if you are not making a huge profit, you will still probably owe something. To minimize these expenses, it’s best to work with an accountant year-round. An accountant can make sure you are taking advantage of all of the deductions available to lower your tax bill. Having a sound tax strategy will help you maximize the amount of money you have to reinvest each year in your startup. Related: Founders Keep Making These 9 Common Mistakes That Crush Promising Startups 3. Interest and funding A lot of entrepreneurs have no other choice but to take out a business loan to finance their dreams. In fact, the National Small Business Association estimates that 69 percent of small businesses used loans or another type of financing in 2016. These loans may seem like a quick and easy way to inject cash into the business. However, many entrepreneurs forget to factor in interest payments when deciding whether or not it’s a good idea to take out a loan. The exact interest rate will vary depending on the type of loan and your current situation. Don’t get caught off guard by an unexpected interest payment. If you are planning on taking out a loan, be sure to read the fine print carefully before signing on the dotted line. Another popular route many startups are taking is turning to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. These sites allow startups to crowdsource funds often at a much more attractive term than a traditional loan. 4. Shrinkage Startup companies that are selling products in a brick-and-mortar setting, or even online, may experience a surprising amount of shrinkage. The 2016 National Retail Security Survey revealed that shrinkage costs companies in the U.S. about $45 billion every year. To prevent shrinkage, entrepreneurs must first determine where their products are the most vulnerable to shrinkage. Shrinkage can occur because of shoplifting, employee theft and errors. Shoplifting is by far the most common cause, so you may want to start by here. For example, a retail business owner will need to consider installing a security system, hiring enough people to watch over customers, and training employees to look for signs that someone is shoplifting. Preparing in this manner can help entrepreneurs fight shrinkage and protect their finances. Ecommerce businesses should ensure they have a proper auditing system in place to prevent errors and lost product. There are only so many hours in the day, so time is by far the most valuable resource that you cannot afford to waste. Entrepreneurs often fear that they will hurt their business by not managing their time wisely. Are you spending too much time on activities that could be outsourced? Are you not spending enough time on networking and acquiring new clients? These are the questions that haunt every entrepreneur. Related: How Small Businesses Are Solving Big Business Challenges The way you spend your time can also impact your personal life. Entrepreneurs must be committed to launching their business, which often means working long hours and leaving little time for their loved ones. Because of this, many entrepreneurs fear that their new venture could affect their personal relationships. There’s no reason for startup founders to fear how much time they will spend on their business. There is a way to find a balance between work and your personal life, and that is good time management. Make the most out of every moment in your day so you can get more work done and leave more time for loved ones. Eliminate distractions in the workplace, delegate low-value tasks to others, and take advantage of scheduling and time management apps to keep you on track. By preparing for these expenses, entrepreneurs can ensure their startup is part of the one-third of businesses that hit their 10 year anniversary.

GLENN THRUSH,"Traditionally states, and not the federal government, have been responsible for hashing out the details of assessing damage, processing claims and distributing funding in the wake of national disasters, a system intended to give local decision makers control over how their communities are rebuilt. But states and cities, unaccustomed to dealing with the complex logistical and oversight issues of administering programs geared at fast-tracking billions in capital projects, are now finding themselves overwhelmed by the demands, even though such challenges have been well-documented since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of the areas most prone to repeated hurricanes, especially Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and now North Carolina, have all experienced similar problems as they adjust to a new normal in which disaster agencies are permanently mobilized and f ederal disaster money is now one of the single biggest sources of government money used to help rehabilitate or preserve low-income housing. We are really good at disaster recovery programs, hazard mitigation, helping individual people who are in trouble, but not at this kind of thing, said the states emergency management director, Michael A. Sprayberry, who contends that the lessons learned under Matthew will help the state more efficiently distribute post-Florence disaster funding. We have had to hire and stand up a completely new staff roughly 50, 60 new people so this is a whole new ballgame. It took more than 10 months to comply with federally mandated environmental reviews and other red tape, Mr. Sprayberry said, which is contributing to the frustration.

To put the devastation into perspective, Hurricane María completely destroyed more than 87,000 homes in Puerto Rico (with more than 385,000 other homes sustaining major damage). Some 250,000 Puerto Rico residents were displaced to the mainland United States, in some cases permanently. One study from the New England Journal of Medicine said that Hurricane María claimed some 4,600 lives, though the authors added that even this staggering figure could turn out to be conservative. In terms of costs, it’s estimated that Hurricane María has cost more than $90 billion. We were one of 10,000 businesses affected by the hurricane. And yet, we knew that maintaining normal operations in the face of such obstacles was non-negotiable, given the vital technical services we provide to insurance companies and medical providers. And while not every tech company will have to deal with the catastrophe of a hurricane, there will almost certainly be unforeseen obstacles that test every company’s resilience. We're in the middle of hurricane season again. Now that we're in the middle of hurricane season 2018, here are the lessons we learned that other companies facing disasters similar to ours -- especially companies in technology -- can do to ""weather the storm"" when disaster strikes. Build a team and a company culture you can trust. Running a tech startup comes with its ups and downs, especially if your company is as ambitious as ours. At Abartys Health, our mission is to use a centralized data hub among stakeholders to reduce the $750 billion loss that’s incurred every year in the U.S. healthcare industry. Related: 5 Steps to Getting Your Company Ready for a Natural Disaster When Hurricane María hit, our culture of responsibility and accountability was put to the test: I went days without being able to get in touch with several co-workers. Yet, I was confident that the work was getting done. Our programming team, for example, worked on their computers locally and later made updates to the system once they were able to access the Internet. I was particularly amazed by how effective a communication channel Slack proved to be; team members took the initiative to check in and provide project updates whenever they had internet access. In short, our talented team members were determined to keep the operation running without anyone on the leadership team having to micromanage. The whole experience validated my belief that a great company needs to prioritize cultivating talented, self-motivated and resourceful people. It also taught me that whether a company makes this a priority may become the measure of its resilience. When storm clouds hit, this is what will decide whether your company will swim or sink. Have a dependable disaster plan -- and stick to it. Almost every company has a business plan. Some companies (especially well-established ones) have business continuity plans and policies. But few companies ever consider apocalyptic scenarios. Hurricane María taught me that every company -- and tech companies in particular -- need a plan for when key infrastructure fails. Logistical challenges, such as losing electricity or internet, might seem impossible for a tech company to overcome. Operations come to a screeching halt; banking is frozen; client account executives are pushed into survival mode; and development (a constant driving force at any tech company) is put on the back burner. So, what will your company do when a disaster brings about unimaginable logistical challenges? For me, a good disaster plan should include: 1. An emergency home base. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, many of our team members worked from my co-founder’s apartment, which had a stable source of power and internet, and wasn’t severely impacted by the storm. Some team members even made it a temporary home. The level of bonding this brought about was remarkable. Because you can’t foresee how long you might be unable to operate from your normal place of business, the value of having an emergency home base when things go haywire cannot be understated. 2. A designated person to leave before a predicted disaster. Before María brought catastrophic conditions, some team members left the island in order to maintain communication with our clients. My co-founder left for Atlanta where her family is from, and our lead architect went to Miami. This helped ensure that we’d have dependable communication with our clients as well as the peace of mind that our systems would continue to run smoothly. For tech companies, having team players who are strong communicators, competent both in the big picture of your company as well as the finer technical points and individual relationships is always an asset. 3. Logistical and technical considerations made beforehand. Electricity is something we all take for granted. But what do you do -- especially if you’re a tech company -- if the power goes out? We were fortunate that a board member had access to generators through a personal connection. We also purchased and delivered several generators for our team in the aftermath of the storm. Having a back-up plan for logistical needs in the face of calamity will provide much-needed aid in maintaining business operations and help staffers regain a sense of normalcy. 4. A means for maintaining contact with clients (and leads). Facing and overcoming unexpected challenges when it comes to delivering for a client is a natural part of entrepreneurship. If we hadn't appreciated this before Hurricane María, we could have been in serious trouble. As the hurricane approached, we were right in the middle of closing a major client. Before the storm made landfall, I forwarded my co-founder (who'd left for Atlanta) every piece of client communication I had, knowing that we would be without electricity for a few days (that loss would last for months for much of the island ). Not only was she able to close the deal, she also communicated the new client’s needs to our lead architect in Miami. Of course, some clients were dealing with the same catastrophe as we were. To give their businesses peace of mind,my co-founder called and emailed these clients to tell them their data was safe. The bottom line is that disasters happen. You need to maintain your calm with clients and maintain as much normalcy as possible. 5. Sensitivity to your team’s needs. A disaster like this can put everything into perspective. As important as it is to maintain normalcy with clients, providing support for your co-workers is just as important, if not more. Start by understanding the needs of every team member on a personal level. When María struck, the last thing we wanted was for our colleagues to have to choose between being there for their families and meeting a deadline at work. Our VP of engineering, for example, lives in a remote area of the island and has two small children at home. After the hurricane, he had to fill up his own water tank for months on end just to have water in his house. This often required him to leave the office early and, sometimes, he could make it in only a few times per week. Not only were we happy to make this concession, but we provided support for him and his family in other ways as well. The lesson is, if the leaders of a company don’t have genuine concern for the well-being of their team members, they can’t expect them to perform their jobs at a high level. This may seem obvious, but once again, the advent of disaster put this notion into stark relief. In sum, disasters are, by their nature, unpredictable. Even when we knew Hurricane María was coming, before the storm made landfall, the impact was far greater than we could have anticipated.

Jon Fingas,"While there were no known casualties or property damage, this doesn't mean it was safe. For one thing, China normally plans booster drop zones carefully and alerts (or in some cases, evacuates) areas to make sure no one gets hurt. This didn't entirely go according to plan. Moreover, the highly toxic rocket fuel and secondary explosions posed risks to curious onlookers. Not that China has much choice in the matter. As the Atlantic explained, three of China's launch facilities were opened during the Cold War, when concerns about attacks took precedence over absolute safety. That meant setting up shop as far away from international borders as possible, guaranteeing that some launches would pose a risk to populated areas. A 1996 disaster even sent a rocket directly into the town of Xichang, killing at least six and injuring dozens more.

Roger Cheng,"The intricate network of small metal pipes, capped off by six-foot-high metal scaffolding, shouldn't stand out amid the numerous pieces of industrial equipment littered throughout the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. After all, it's a power plant. 
I take a closer look, and notice spheres of ice perched upon the smaller pipes, which line the center of the structure. The facility sits at the water's edge, and there's a brisk breeze blowing through. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
But not that brisk.
It turns out, coolant is running through the pipes, freezing the soil below and creating an impermeable ice wall that's nearly 100 feet deep and a mile long, encircling the reactors.
It's like a smaller-scale subterranean version of the Wall in Game of Thrones, but instead of keeping out White Walkers and wights, this line of defense keeps in a far more realistic danger: radioactive contaminants from melted-down reactors that threaten to spill into the water by Fukushima Daiichi.
Daiichi is the site of the worst nuclear disaster, which happened after an earthquake hit on March 11, 2011, triggering a tsunami that devastated the facility. Two 50-foot-high waves knocked out the power generators that were keeping three of the six reactors' fuel rods cool, triggering explosions and meltdowns that forced more than 160,000 people to flee their homes. Many of them still haven't returned.
I came to Fukushima to check out the robots tasked with the near-impossible task of cleaning up Fukushima Daiichi.  While here, I encountered this underground wall of ice.
The structure, which cost roughly $300 million, paid for by public funds, serves as critical protection, defending the Fukushima area from one of the most radioactive hotspots in the world. While Tokyo Electric Power Co., also known as Tepco, struggles to find a way to remove radioactive material from the facility a process the government estimates could take more than four decades -- the more immediate concern is what to do with the contaminated water leaking out from the facility.
Nobody has taken on a project of this scale.
 Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit
One of the solutions has been to put up (down?) this underground ice wall, which prevents much of the surrounding groundwater from getting in. And while the practice of freezing soil to create a barrier has been around for more than 150 years, the magnitude of the application that stands before me is quite literally groundbreaking.
""Nobody has taken on a project of this scale,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter.
Ice cold
While the term ""ice wall"" has a colorful ring to it, engineers use the more academic-sounding term Artificial Ground Freezing. The technique came out of France in 1862 as a way to help with the construction of mine shafts before German engineer F.H. Poetsch patented it. Since then, it's been used to aid in building underwater tunnels or vertical shafts, as well as to cut off groundwater or redirect contaminated materials.
Little balls of ice line the pipes that go underground and form the ice wall. 
James Martin/CNET
At Fukushima, my eyes follow the path of the pipes, which stretch around the reactor building. A Tepco employee tells me that a calcium chloride solution is pumped down through a smaller inner pipe, and circulated back up a large outer pipe.
The coolant brings down the temperature of each pipe to -30 degrees Celsius, or -22 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pipes are spaced about three feet apart. The cold emanating from each one hardens the soil around it.
The point of the ice wall is to keep the groundwater that runs down from the mountains to the west from entering Fukushima Daiichi and mixing with the toxic water leaking out of the Unit 1, 2 and 3 reactors. That is,  keep the clean water on the outside of the wall, while the contaminated water stays inside.  
Tepco and manufacturing partners, such as Toshiba and Mitsubishi, are working on robots to identify and determine how to clear out the radioactive materials in each of the reactors' primary containment vessels, essentially the heart of each facility.
Until then, they need a way to slow or stop the flow of water into the facility. At least initially, Tepco wasn't even sure if the project was feasible.
The coolant is -22 degrees Fahrenheit -- cold enough to solidify the surround soil.
James Martin/CNET
""One of the challenges was how they would inject the pipes into the earth at such a deep level without impacting the other operations around it, and whether it would work,"" Yagi says.
With the wall in place, Tepco says it has been able to reduce the level of contaminated water generated from Daiichi. But a Reuters report in March 2018 found that the wall still let a fair amount of clean water in, adding to the volume of toxic water the company needs to deal with. Tepco, however, says it's been effective in reducing the volume.
""We know this is not the end of our effort,"" says a company spokesman. ""We will be continuously working hard to reduce the amount of  generation of contaminated water.""
The leaky bucket
Imagine a leaky bucket that constantly needs to be filled with water. At the same time, the water from the leak needs to be collected and stored. And there's no end in sight to this cycle.
That essentially is the problem that Tepco faces at Daiichi. The fuel rods stored in the three radioactive units constantly have to be cooled with fresh water, but leaks mean the company needs to be vigilant about keeping the tainted liquid from getting out of the facility's grounds.  
The pipes go nearly 100 feet deep underground, and contain a coolant that freezes the soil into a wall. 
James Martin/CNET
Since the accident nearly eight years ago, Tepco has collected 1.1 million tons of contaminated water in 900 tanks stored on the grounds at Daiichi. The company estimates it has enough space in the 37.7-million-square-foot facility to house an additional 270,000 tons of water, which means it would run out sometime in 2020.
""We're conscious of the fact that we can't keep storing more and more water,"" Kenji Abe, a spokesman for Tepco's decommissioning and decontamination unit, says through an interpreter.
Tepco has worked on several solutions to decrease the level of contaminated water generated by the facility. The company has switched from tanks sealed with bolts to welded tanks, which offer greater storage capacity and less risk of leaks. There's a steel wall by the water to keep the contaminants from flowing into the ocean. Tepco has also covered 96 percent of the surface of most of the facility with concrete, preventing rainwater from seeping in.
Then there's the ice wall, which has done its share of lowering the amount of contaminated water generated from the facility by keeping out most of the groundwater.
Over the past three and a half years, Tepco has seen the amount of polluted water generated fall by a quarter to just under 3,900 cubic feet of water per day, with occasional spikes during periods of rainfall.
The final element
I'm in full protective gear, including a Tyvek coverall, hardhat and full-face respirator mask, walking through one of three water treatment facilities at Daiichi. I move hastily, trying to keep up with my Tepco guides, when my suit gets snagged on an exposed bolt.
Did the suit rip? My eyes shoot back at my photographer and widen with fear. This is usually the part in an outbreak movie that dooms a key character. I look down and see the suit is still intact, and breathe a sigh of relief.
Massive tanks of water litter the grounds of Fukushima Daicchi. 
James Martin/CNET
It turns out, I didn't need to panic. The facility, called the Advanced Liquid Processing System, isn't radioactive, although it's designed to remove radioactive elements from the collected water. There are three such facilities, which can process a total of 70,630 cubic feet of water a day.
So far, treatment technology from partner companies like Kurion and Sarry have enabled Tepco to remove 62 of the 63 radioactive elements from the water, but one, tritium, remains.
An inside look at Fukushima Daiichi's Ice Wall
It's this one element, which is bonded to the water at an atomic level, that means Tepco needs to keep collecting and storing the water.
Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy, notes that reactors in China and Canada already discharge water with tritium.

James Martin/CNET
""It's fundamentally safe,"" Barrett says.
But given the sensitivities around Fukushima, Tepco must continue to store the water.
The Japanese government is still working out what to do.
""Resolving the issue of the contaminated water is something we haven't yet reached a final solution on,"" Yagi says.
Analyzing the data
Underneath the building housing the restaurant and employee rest area is a water treatment analysis center, a super-clean area that requires us to go through numerous radiation tests and four sets of boot changes.
There are glass beakers containing sea water, groundwater and water from the ALPS facilities. Scientists walk around in silence, moving beakers from one machine to another. A dozen machines in a second room measure the gamma ray levels.
Inside the water treatment center. 
James Martin/CNET
The facility was originally built underground in 2014 because it needed to be on the Daiichi site, but couldn't be exposed to radiation because of the nature of the tests. The walls are 8 inches thick, with the more sensitive labs hardened with an additional 20 inches. The facility has grown by 16 times over the past four years as it expanded the number of workers and machines.
Inside the water treatment analysis facility underneath Fukushima Daiichi. 
James Martin/CNET
""No other facility in Japan can handle the amount of data and work we do here,"" says a Tepco scientist working at the facility who preferred not to identify himself.
He adds that all of the data is released publicly. ""That's because society demands work with a high level of trust,"" he says.
The scientist explains that Japan has set a legal radioactivity limit of 60,000 becquerel per liter of tritium. But the treated water is still at 1.7 million Bq per liter, or roughly 30 times what's deemed safe.
So, for now, Tepco must continue collecting the water. And the ice wall continues to stand, invisible to onlookers, as one of the most important lines of defense.","Think Game of Thrones, but this one is underground and defends against a far more realistic threat.",2019-03-05T13:00:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Fukushima's nuclear disaster defense?

Roger Cheng,"My nose itches. I instinctively reach up, but my fingers, wrapped in three gloves one made of cloth, two of latex hit the clear plastic shield of my full-face respirator mask. 
My hand clumsily holds a reporter's notebook and pen. I'm wearing white Tyvek coveralls over my trousers, shirt and head, which is capped off by a bright yellow hard hat.  I'm also wearing two layers of socks and heavy rubber boots. Walking around isn't easy, and the gear feels like an awkward second and third, and fourth skin. The claustrophobic gear seems straight out of a thriller about a zombie apocalypse. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
And then there's that itch I just can't scratch. 
There's a good reason for all that protection I'm inside the cavernous top of the Unit 3 reactor in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Yes, that Fukushima Daiichi, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. 
Unit 3 was one of three reactors crippled on March 11, 2011, after a 9.0 earthquake struck 80 miles off the coast of Japan. (Units 4, 5 and 6 at Daiichi weren't operating at the time.) The temblor shook so violently it shifted the Earth's axis by nearly 4 inches and moved the coast of Japan by 8 feet. Eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants throughout the region were operating at the time. All shut down automatically. All reported no significant damage.  
An hour later, the tsunami reached shore. 
Two 50-foot-high waves barreled straight at Fukushima Daiichi, washing over coastal seawalls and disabling the diesel generators powering the plant's seawater cooling systems. Temperatures inside the reactors skyrocketed to as high as 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Fuel rods became molten puddles of uranium that chewed through the floors below, leaving a radioactive cocktail of fuel rods, concrete, steel and melted debris. Molten fuel ultimately sank into the three reactors' primary containment vessels, designed to catch and secure contaminated material. 
Next Monday marks the eighth anniversary of the earthquake. After all this time, Japanese energy giant Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, has barely scratched the surface of the problem. It's cleared enough of the rubble on the top floor of the Unit 3 building to allow for my 10-minute visit. 
I gaze up at the massive barrel vault ceiling, trying to get a handle on the sheer scale of everything. Radiation levels are too high for me to linger. My quickening pace and breath are betrayed by rapid flapping noises coming from the purple filters on both sides of my respirator mask. 
At the far end of the room, there's an enormous orange platform known as a fuel-handling machine. It has four giant metal legs that taper down, giving the structure a sort of animalistic look. Thin steel cables suspend a chrome robot in the center of the frame. The robot, largely obscured by a pink plastic wrapper, is equipped with so-called manipulators that can cut rubble and grab fuel rods. The robot will eventually pull radioactive wreckage out of a 39-foot-deep pool in the center of the room. 
It's just one of the many robots Tepco is using to clean up the power plant. It's why I came to Japan this past November to see how robots are working in one of the most extreme situations imaginable. 
The Japanese government estimates it will cost $75.7 billion and take 40 years to fully decommission and tear down the facility. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency even built a research center nearby to mock up conditions inside the power plant, allowing experts from around the country to try out new robot designs for clearing away the wreckage. 
The hope is that the research facility along with a drone-testing field an hour away can clean up Daiichi and revitalize Fukushima Prefecture, once known for everything from seafood to sake. The effort will take so long that Tepco and government organizations are grooming the next generation of robotics experts to finish the job. 
Fukushima was a humbling moment. It showed the limits of robot technologies.
 Rian Whitton, ABI Research
""It's of the magnitude of putting a man on the moon,"" says Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy. ""Unless there's an acceleration, I would not be surprised if it takes 60 years or so."" 
Everything's relative
There's something quintessentially Japanese about hearing the jingle to the 1970s anime classic Space Battleship Yamato while taking an elevator to the top of a nuclear reactor.   
CNET photographer James Martin and I lock eyes when the tune plays, stirring memories from our childhoods. It's a brief moment of whimsy in such deadly surroundings. 
Two years ago, Tepco erected a dome over the Unit 3 reactor and fuel pool so that engineers could bring in heavy equipment and now, us. 
Roughly 60 feet below me, radiation is being emitted at 1 sievert per hour. A single dose at that level is enough to cause radiation sickness such as nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. One dose of 5 sieverts an hour would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while exposure to 10 sieverts in an hour would be fatal within weeks. 
Unit 3 is the least contaminated of the three destroyed reactors.   
Radiation in Unit 1 has been measured at 4.1 to 9.7 sieverts per hour. And two years ago, a reading taken at the deepest level of Unit 2 was an ""unimaginable"" 530 sieverts, according to The Guardian. Readings elsewhere in Unit 2 are typically closer to 70 sieverts an hour, still making it the hottest of Daiichi's hotspots.   
Bundled up for a 10-minute visit to Unit 3. 
James Martin/CNET
The reactors' hostile environments brought most of the early robots to their figurative knees: High gamma radiation levels scrambled the electrons within the semiconductors serving as the robots' brains ruling out machines that are too sophisticated. Autonomous robots would either shut down or get snared by misshapen obstacles in unexpected places. 
The robots also had to be nimble enough to avoid disturbing the volatile melted fuel rods, essentially playing the world's deadliest game of ""Operation."" At least initially, they weren't.  
""Fukushima was a humbling moment,"" says Rian Whitton, an analyst at ABI Research. ""It showed the limits of robot technologies."" 
Robot love
Consider the Scorpion, a 24-inch-long robot that could curl up its camera-mounted tail for better viewing angles. In December 2016, workers cut out a hole in the PCV of Unit 2 for the Scorpion to enter. Tepco hoped the robot, with its two cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels and temperatures, would finally provide a glimpse inside the reactor.   
The Scorpion became stuck after just two hours in what was supposed to have been a 10-hour mission, blocked by lumps of melted metal. It had taken Toshiba over two and a half years, and an undisclosed sum, to develop the robot. 
Touring the Fukushima power plant requires a near-constant change of rubber boots. 
James Martin/CNET
""Even if the [Scorpion] failed in its mission, the data that we received from the robot has been beneficial,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter, noting that engineers have since added guide pipes and other design elements to help new machines get around. 
Still, the failure underscores the inherent weakness of flashy robots with multiple parts versus simpler, purpose-built alternatives. ""They're trying to develop sophisticated technology without understanding the full solution,"" says an industry expert who isn't authorized to talk publicly about the decontamination process. 
Barrett lays part of the blame on Tepco's sole reliance on established Japanese manufacturers like Toshiba and Hitachi, saying the utility needs to embrace more of an experimental, Silicon Valley mentality. 
""Where's the long-haired kid with the body piercings?"" he says. ""You got to have one or two of them.""

 Success after failure 
Seven months after the Scorpion setback, in July 2017, Toshiba sent a small (12 inches long and 5 inches around) submersible robot, nicknamed Sunfish, into the flooded PCV of Unit 3. On its second day of reconnaissance, Sunfish Sunfish recorded the first signs of melted fuel inside a reactor. 
Toshiba returned to the heavily contaminated Unit 2 in January 2018 with a new machine carrying one camera that could pan and tilt and another attached to the tip of a telescopic guide pipe, offering a bird's-eye view. Once that machine reached the heart of the PCV, workers remotely lowered the pan-and-tilt camera an additional seven and a half feet to take photos.

""This has to all be created to address specific challenges,"" says Takayuki Nakahara, a specialist for Toshiba who helped create the structure to lower the robot. 
The robot not only survived Unit 2's mega-radioactivity, it showed Tepco that the floor of the PCV held mud and pebbles thought to be melted fuel debris, adding new wrinkles to the cleanup task. 
In February, Tepco sent a modified version of the same robot back down, where it was able to touch some of the pebbles for the first time. The company said the robot was able to take more photos and get radiation and temperature readings without disturbing the surrounding environment.  
 Reconnaissance mission 
Hushed conversations echo from around the off-white control room in a building 350 meters (about 1,150 feet) from Unit 2. Bare ceiling pipes, office chairs and racks of computer equipment break up the otherwise sparse space. There's a quiet intensity from the nearly two dozen men. All wear jumpsuits color-coded to their company affiliations, like military officers preparing for war. 
Two special chairs have been outfitted with joysticks at the end of each armrest. A Tepco operator sits in one chair controlling a specially built Brokk 400D, a big blue bot that looks like a miniature excavator running on two large tank treads. He stares intently at four monitors giving him a real-time feed of what's happening inside the Unit 2 reactor.

An operator in the other chair is controlling an iRobot Packbot, used in war zones and by first responders to clear explosive devices and detect biological, chemical and radioactive threats. 
But these robots aren't the standard-issue versions. Instead of its usual bucket claw, this Brokk 400D has a sensor to look for gamma ray hotspots. The Packbot comes with a camera to give the operator extra viewing angles. Both robots have been kitted with a lead-lined communication box. Fiber-optic lines connect that box to a special room next to the reactor room where workers use Wi-Fi to relay info to the control room. 
For those of us from Fukushima who live here, we try to live as we did before. 
This is only the second such mission, and it's strictly for reconnaissance. The two robots are on top of the Unit 2 reactor  not inside the PCV looking for radiation hotspots. Tepco hopes the information beamed back from the robots will eventually help it remove large chunks of fuel and wreckage from the top section of the reactor, making it possible for Unit 2 to get its own dome cover.

The JAEA fully opened the facility in 2016 to give companies, students and researchers the tools they need to develop remotely controlled robots capable of handling Daiichi's unique challenges. ""We have almost three years of experience to support such users,"" says Kuniaki Kawabata, principle researcher at the center. 
Kawabata sports an off-white jacket with a small JAEA logo emblazoned over the left breast. He's one of the few officials I meet willing to speak English to me as he breaks down the different kinds of resources at this facility. 
The VR experience, for instance, lets users take a virtual robot through the facility to see if it could make it down stairs or through tight spaces. There's even an object detection warning a buzzing sound if your robot fails to get past an obstruction. 
For more real-world tests, there's the Full-Scale Mock-Up Test Building, a structure so massive it could fit two 747s stacked on top of each other. The extra space is handy when re-creating parts of a reactor or testing drones. 
We must educate and do some skills transfer from the current generation to the next generation.

There's a full-scale replica of a one-eighth slice of the suppression chamber, a massive tube that looks like a donut wrapped around the base of the PCV. Even the small sliver of the structure towers over us. A suppression chamber stores much of the contaminated water from the PCV, and researchers are testing if remotely controlled robots can patch leaks from inside a chamber. 
Other areas include a large pool for testing robots underwater, and stairs that can be moved and adjusted to re-create a range of challenges that robots which tend to struggle with the basic tasks of going up and down steps will likely encounter. There's also an obstacle course for humans training to operate robots through tight pathways.

The goal, Kawabata tells me, is to make sure future engineers and operators can take over the decades-long tasks that lie ahead. 
""We must educate and do some skills transfer from the current generation to the next generation,"" he says. ""We must [attract] good students to get them to come."" 
That's also true for the Robot Test Field, an hour's drive north of Naraha in Minamisoma, which sometime this year will include mock bridges, tunnels and other obstacles that drones can maneuver around. And in 2020, the area will host the World Robot Summit, with many of the exhibitions focused on disaster response and infrastructure support. The government of Fukushima Prefecture hopes companies from around the world will eventually come here to test their drones. 
 Ghost towns 
As you drive up the Rikuzenhama Highway from Naraha to Fukushima Daiichi, you can see the Fukushima region slowly coming back to life, including a local supermarket and police station in Tamioka bustling with activity. 
Get closer to the facility, however, and you find businesses and homes blocked by metal gates. They're in Futaba, Tamioka and Okuma, once-thriving communities near the power plant that were forced to evacuate.

Now they're ghost towns. 
In Tamioka, I spot a giant Sonic the Hedgehog adorning the outside of a two-story arcade. Time, neglect and the tsunami have wrecked the building, with half of a wall on the second floor blown out. 
Farther down the street, there's a Toyota Corolla repair shop whose glass exterior has been shattered into tiny shards. Across the highway, hundreds of bags are filled with radiated dirt that Japan doesn't know what to do with a stark reminder of the problems it still faces. 
It's a snapshot of what everything looked like right after the tsunami hit. Buildings here have been virtually untouched by humans since then. Fully dressed mannequins stand in a nearby retail shop.

That could change. The Japanese government now permits people to return for visits in the daytime. During our stay, the local newspaper ran a story saying former residents would be allowed to move back to some of the evacuation zones in May. 
""For those of us from Fukushima who live here, we try to live as we did before,"" says Shunsuke Ono, who runs the J Village hotel and sports complex in Naraha. ""For people outside of Fukushima, there's a feeling that Fukushima is not normal."" Ono says he doesn't feel in danger living in the area. 
Not everyone thinks the same way, says Masaaki Hanaoka, executive general manager of Tepco's International Affairs Office. ""They're concerned about services like medical, commerce and business, as well as the community recovery and radiation level reductions,"" he tells me. 
 Nature's power 
When the explosions blew the tops off Units 1 and 3, radioactive material contaminated the soil around Daiichi. The plant's once parklike surroundings have since been almost completely paved over to prevent rainwater from leaching into the contaminated soil and spilling out to the ocean. 
Tepco boasts that you can walk around 96 percent of the 37.7-million-square-foot facility with just the standard jumpsuit and disposable face mask. 
As we walk the grounds, I notice a row of cherry blossom trees in full bloom.

Roger Cheng,"My nose itches. I instinctively reach up, but my fingers, wrapped in three gloves one made of cloth, two of latex hit the clear plastic shield of my full-face respirator mask. 
My hand clumsily holds a reporter's notebook and pen. I'm wearing white Tyvek coveralls over my trousers, shirt and head, which is capped off by a bright yellow hard hat.  I'm also wearing two layers of socks and heavy rubber boots. Walking around isn't easy, and the gear feels like an awkward second and third, and fourth skin. The claustrophobic gear seems straight out of a thriller about a zombie apocalypse. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
And then there's that itch I just can't scratch. 
There's a good reason for all that protection I'm inside the cavernous top of the Unit 3 reactor in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Yes, that Fukushima Daiichi, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. 
Unit 3 was one of three reactors crippled on March 11, 2011, after a 9.0 earthquake struck 80 miles off the coast of Japan. (Units 4, 5 and 6 at Daiichi weren't operating at the time.) The temblor shook so violently it shifted the Earth's axis by nearly 4 inches and moved the coast of Japan by 8 feet. Eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants throughout the region were operating at the time. All shut down automatically. All reported no significant damage.  
An hour later, the tsunami reached shore. 
Two 50-foot-high waves barreled straight at Fukushima Daiichi, washing over coastal seawalls and disabling the diesel generators powering the plant's seawater cooling systems. Temperatures inside the reactors skyrocketed to as high as 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Fuel rods became molten puddles of uranium that chewed through the floors below, leaving a radioactive cocktail of fuel rods, concrete, steel and melted debris. Molten fuel ultimately sank into the three reactors' primary containment vessels, designed to catch and secure contaminated material. 
Next Monday marks the eighth anniversary of the earthquake. After all this time, Japanese energy giant Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, has barely scratched the surface of the problem. It's cleared enough of the rubble on the top floor of the Unit 3 building to allow for my 10-minute visit. 
I gaze up at the massive barrel vault ceiling, trying to get a handle on the sheer scale of everything. Radiation levels are too high for me to linger. My quickening pace and breath are betrayed by rapid flapping noises coming from the purple filters on both sides of my respirator mask. 
At the far end of the room, there's an enormous orange platform known as a fuel-handling machine. It has four giant metal legs that taper down, giving the structure a sort of animalistic look. Thin steel cables suspend a chrome robot in the center of the frame. The robot, largely obscured by a pink plastic wrapper, is equipped with so-called manipulators that can cut rubble and grab fuel rods. The robot will eventually pull radioactive wreckage out of a 39-foot-deep pool in the center of the room. 
It's just one of the many robots Tepco is using to clean up the power plant. It's why I came to Japan this past November to see how robots are working in one of the most extreme situations imaginable. 
The Japanese government estimates it will cost $75.7 billion and take 40 years to fully decommission and tear down the facility. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency even built a research center nearby to mock up conditions inside the power plant, allowing experts from around the country to try out new robot designs for clearing away the wreckage. 
The hope is that the research facility along with a drone-testing field an hour away can clean up Daiichi and revitalize Fukushima Prefecture, once known for everything from seafood to sake. The effort will take so long that Tepco and government organizations are grooming the next generation of robotics experts to finish the job. 
Fukushima was a humbling moment. It showed the limits of robot technologies.
 Rian Whitton, ABI Research
""It's of the magnitude of putting a man on the moon,"" says Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy. ""Unless there's an acceleration, I would not be surprised if it takes 60 years or so."" 
Everything's relative
There's something quintessentially Japanese about hearing the jingle to the 1970s anime classic Space Battleship Yamato while taking an elevator to the top of a nuclear reactor.   
CNET photographer James Martin and I lock eyes when the tune plays, stirring memories from our childhoods. It's a brief moment of whimsy in such deadly surroundings. 
Two years ago, Tepco erected a dome over the Unit 3 reactor and fuel pool so that engineers could bring in heavy equipment and now, us. 
Roughly 60 feet below me, radiation is being emitted at 1 sievert per hour. A single dose at that level is enough to cause radiation sickness such as nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. One dose of 5 sieverts an hour would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while exposure to 10 sieverts in an hour would be fatal within weeks. 
Unit 3 is the least contaminated of the three destroyed reactors.   
Radiation in Unit 1 has been measured at 4.1 to 9.7 sieverts per hour. And two years ago, a reading taken at the deepest level of Unit 2 was an ""unimaginable"" 530 sieverts, according to The Guardian. Readings elsewhere in Unit 2 are typically closer to 70 sieverts an hour, still making it the hottest of Daiichi's hotspots.   
Bundled up for a 10-minute visit to Unit 3.

The reactors' hostile environments brought most of the early robots to their figurative knees: High gamma radiation levels scrambled the electrons within the semiconductors serving as the robots' brains ruling out machines that are too sophisticated. Autonomous robots would either shut down or get snared by misshapen obstacles in unexpected places. 
The robots also had to be nimble enough to avoid disturbing the volatile melted fuel rods, essentially playing the world's deadliest game of ""Operation."" At least initially, they weren't.  
""Fukushima was a humbling moment,"" says Rian Whitton, an analyst at ABI Research. ""It showed the limits of robot technologies."" 
Robot love
Consider the Scorpion, a 24-inch-long robot that could curl up its camera-mounted tail for better viewing angles. In December 2016, workers cut out a hole in the PCV of Unit 2 for the Scorpion to enter. Tepco hoped the robot, with its two cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels and temperatures, would finally provide a glimpse inside the reactor.   
The Scorpion became stuck after just two hours in what was supposed to have been a 10-hour mission, blocked by lumps of melted metal. It had taken Toshiba over two and a half years, and an undisclosed sum, to develop the robot. 
Touring the Fukushima power plant requires a near-constant change of rubber boots. 
James Martin/CNET
""Even if the [Scorpion] failed in its mission, the data that we received from the robot has been beneficial,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter, noting that engineers have since added guide pipes and other design elements to help new machines get around. 
Still, the failure underscores the inherent weakness of flashy robots with multiple parts versus simpler, purpose-built alternatives. ""They're trying to develop sophisticated technology without understanding the full solution,"" says an industry expert who isn't authorized to talk publicly about the decontamination process. 
Barrett lays part of the blame on Tepco's sole reliance on established Japanese manufacturers like Toshiba and Hitachi, saying the utility needs to embrace more of an experimental, Silicon Valley mentality. 
""Where's the long-haired kid with the body piercings?"" he says. ""You got to have one or two of them."" 
(For the record, I never saw anyone with long hair or body piercings on my trip.)

Seven months after the Scorpion setback, in July 2017, Toshiba sent a small (12 inches long and 5 inches around) submersible robot, nicknamed Sunfish, into the flooded PCV of Unit 3. On its second day of reconnaissance, Sunfish Sunfish recorded the first signs of melted fuel inside a reactor. 
Toshiba returned to the heavily contaminated Unit 2 in January 2018 with a new machine carrying one camera that could pan and tilt and another attached to the tip of a telescopic guide pipe, offering a bird's-eye view. Once that machine reached the heart of the PCV, workers remotely lowered the pan-and-tilt camera an additional seven and a half feet to take photos.

In February, Tepco sent a modified version of the same robot back down, where it was able to touch some of the pebbles for the first time.

STEVEN LEE MYERS and JAVIER C. HERNÁNDEZ,"“This is an oil spill of a type we haven’t seen before,” said Paul Johnston, a scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter in England. “Working out the impact is actually a huge task — probably next to impossible.” For China, the disaster has become a test of its ambitions as a global and regional steward of the seas, especially at a time when it is reinforcing its territorial claims, including disputed territories with Japan in these waters. Given its proximity, China has taken the lead in investigating the disaster and monitoring the spill, but it has faced some criticism for what some see as a slow and inadequate response thus far. Officials in Beijing announced on Feb. 1 that samples of fish taken within four to five nautical miles of the sunken ship contained traces of petroleum hydrocarbons, suggesting possible condensate contamination; they pledged to expand the range of testing to 90 miles, and closely monitor fish coming into markets. The threat of contamination has raised anxiety in the ports that cling to the rugged coastlines of Zhoushan’s islands, though such fears are usually expressed with quiet resignation lest one offend the government. “The quality will go down because of the oil in the water,” Hai Tao, a fish wholesaler at the International Aquatic Product City in Putuo, a district on Zhoushan’s biggest island, said as he watched a ship unload hundreds of crates of mantis shrimp, a delicacy headed to restaurants across China. The spill began on the evening of Jan. 6, when the Sanchi, a Panamanian-flagged, Iranian-owned tanker, collided with a cargo ship in waters roughly 160 nautical miles east of Shanghai. The Sanchi exploded and burned for more than a week before sinking. All 32 crew members are presumed dead. Katya Popova, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Center in England, said there had not been a sufficiently coordinated international operation, and that was exacerbating the scale of the disaster. The lack of visible devastation has almost certainly dampened public reaction that might have galvanized a more vigorous response.

JIM DWYER,"Over the years that followed, Chief Pfeifer created the department’s Center for Terrorism and Disaster Preparedness. A loss of control afflicts crime and terrorism victims alike, he said: “By making a difference, it’s gaining back one’s sense of being.” Some reforms turned out to be impossible or maddeningly slow or required black-belt-level bureaucratic judo. The police department agreed to routinely take fire chiefs along on flights over three-alarm blazes — but only, Chief Pfeifer said, after he made a deal with news organizations for chiefs to ride in their aircraft. Now commanders on the ground get video feeds from drones and the choppers. The real estate industry shut down an effort to require more exit stairs in new buildings because, as a city commissioner explained, “One inch on every staircase in every high rise is hundreds of thousands of dollars.” With the arrival of Bill Bratton as police commissioner in 2014, Chief Pfeifer said, an era of cooperation began. “The next mega-attack will come back to high-rises,” Chief Pfeifer said. Vertical terrorists will use guns and arson. Fire could hold off police officers, and guns would stop firefighters. “How do law enforcement, and fire, and medical, all operate together in very hostile environments?” he asked.

He is looking for more permanent housing. In the meantime, he has also signed up as a volunteer to help families clean the debris from their burned-down homes. “I lost it all, and if I can help clean up, then that will make me feel better,” he said. The fire continues to burn, though it has turned westward away from Redding. As of Sunday, it has burned 160,000 acres and is 43 percent contained. Gov. Jerry Brown on Saturday toured the Lake Redding Estates neighborhood and urged Californians to come together as “one state and one country” to respond to these disasters. “This is part of a trend, a new normal, and we’ve got to deal with it,” Mr. Brown said. “These kind of horrible situations bring people together regardless of the lesser kind of ideologies and partisan considerations. It’s tragic that tragedy brings us closer together, but out of that we learn to depend on each other and work together,” he said. President Trump on Saturday approved a disaster declaration for California, which will make federal assistance available for Shasta County residents affected by the Carr Fire.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives ""Stranger Things"" has nothing on this. screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Ads are like phones. They come, they go and they affect the world not in the slightest. Then there's this insanely twisted, artistic oeuvre on behalf of the AGM X2. Chinese company AGM is renowned for creating rugged, durable phones. This ad, I feel sure, is one of the most durable ever made. We're in a hospital. A woman waits for news of her husband, who's clearly been undergoing surgery. A surgeon emerges to tell her that her husband is dead. She collapses with pain and grief. The surgeon has more to say: ""But I have good news for you."" Indeed, the good news is that the surgeon has digitized the consciousness of the husband's brain and inserted it into the fine, sturdy AGM X2 phone. You didn't think that was going to happen, did you? What follows is beautifully macabre and a wonderful indication of what your children's futures might look like. The (almost) widowed woman stares into her phone everywhere she goes, chatting with her husband. As you would too, if you were in these circumstances and technology allowed it. Her husband says he's doing remarkably well. Given that he lives inside the phone, he needs charging rather than food. And then, as if this woman hasn't already suffered enough, she drops her phone -- and her husband's brain -- in the river. She's bathed in grief all over again. This ad is cruel beyond measure. But then someone fishes the phone out -- did I mention these phones are said to be waterproof? -- and her husband is with her again. They go for a celebratory walk together and, naturally, take selfies. How he takes his selfie has to be witnessed in order to have truly lived. And then, as if the warped cruelty hasn't been enough, the woman is set upon by a gang of men whose leader seems to have had designs on her and is upset that she's married. Yes, this ad really is a soap opera all presented in just over three minutes. Yet again, the phone suffers punishment and ends up back in the river. (Well, you have to get those product points across, don't you?) Is this enough drama for you? A spokesman for AGM told me that, since it was released at the end of January, the ad has garnered more than 6 million online views on the mobile video platform MIAOPAI. This is, though, one of the more demented creations I've ever had the privilege of witnessing. I fear I may never be able to forget it.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright US NAtional Archives Image caption Islanders digging the graves at the Otranto Cemetery It is the whisky-making Scottish island, world famous for its peaty single malts and warm hospitality. But the isle of Islay, in the Inner Hebrides, is now being recognised for an almost forgotten example of huge courage and humanity. A hundred years ago, Islay was on the frontline in the battle at sea during World War One. The island coped with mass casualties from two major troopship disasters just eight months apart. Image caption The story featured on the front page of the American newspapers Between them, the sinkings of the SS Tuscania in February and HMS Otranto in October, claimed the lives of about 700 men in the last year of the war. Both will be officially commemorated on Islay this week. A century ago, the island was enduring considerable pain. It had already lost about 150 sons on the Western front, from a population of just 6,000. Image caption The American monument on Islay's bleak Mull of Oa Every household grieved for someone killed in a far away field. And then the carnage of war came to them. The Tuscania had almost completed its transatlantic voyage, carrying US troops, among a convoy of ships. As it turned into the north channel between Scotland and Ireland on 5 February 1918, danger lurked beneath the waves. Image caption The SS Tuscania was carrying more than 2,000 US troops when it was torpedoed off Islay A German U-boat stalked the convoy, got the Tuscania in its sights and fired two torpedoes - one of which ripped a huge gash in its side. It was a fatal blow. The former luxury liner, converted for the war effort, would soon be on the seabed. The Tuscania was carrying almost 2,500 US soldiers and British crew. Incredibly, most were rescued by the Royal Navy. But some of those who made it into lifeboats were not so lucky. They were swept towards the cliffs and rocks of Islay's Oa peninsula and shipwrecked for a second time. Image caption The troops were shipwrecked off the island's Oa peninsula Private Arthur Siplon was thrown into the sea when his lifeboat capsized. ""He thought he was going to die,"" his youngest son Bob told me. ""But at last he grabbed hold of a rock and when the sea receded he managed to hang on and climbed to the shore."" Image caption Arthur Siplon was rescued from the sea by two Islay farmers Private Siplon was rescued by one of two Islay farmers who risked their own lives pulling men to safety. Robert Morrison and Duncan Campbell gave food and shelter to dozens of survivors and were later awarded the OBE. I have reason to feel particularly proud of Duncan Campbell because, while researching this story, I discovered that he was my great, great uncle. Image caption Duncan Campbell was Glenn's great, great uncle Bob Siplon knows that he and his family would not exist if his father had not found help on Islay. ""It's like the actions of those people 100 years ago ripples through time to affect me 100 years later. ""It tells me that what we do makes a difference"" he said. This was a massive disaster for a small island to manage. In 1918, Islay had no electricity, no air service and few motor vehicles. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The funeral on Islay of 199 American soldiers who were victims of the Otranto disaster The civil authority on this almost crime-free island was a police sergeant on a bicycle, called Malcolm MacNeill. Sgt MacNeill and his three constables had to recover, identify and bury the remains of almost 200. Image caption Sergeant Malcolm MacNeill was the police sergeant on the almost crime-free island His grandson - former Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson - considers their task on a scale comparable with recent terrorist attacks. ""This is like Lockerbie (air disaster) or 7/7 or even 9/11 occurring in a small community. ""A huge event taking place with deaths, bodies, survivors - the calamity that was involved"". Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The funeral of the American soldier victims of the Otranto disaster was attended by all the locals Despite their trauma, the islanders worked tirelessly to bury the dead with dignity. They did not have an American flag for the funerals, so a small group of locals hand-stitched one from the materials they had - working late into the night. That flag has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, which is sending it home on loan to Islay for the centenary. Image caption The US flag made by Islay locals is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC The Smithsonian's Jennifer Jones is impressed by the care the islanders showed for the American soldiers washed up on their shores. ""It was very heartfelt, that people went out of their way to respect those who had recently lost their lives"" she said. Islanders pulled together to respond to the Tuscania sinking. What they could not know is that this was only a preparation for a much bigger disaster to come. Like the Tuscania, HMS Otranto was carrying US troops across the Atlantic in a convoy when disaster struck. But it wasn't an act of war that sank the Otranto on 6 October 1918, within weeks of the armistice. It was a navigational error in a storm. Image caption The HMS Otranto was carrying US troops across the Atlantic when disaster struck As the convoy approached the west coast of Scotland in near hurricane conditions, there was confusion over their exact position. The Otranto was rammed by another ship in the convoy - HMS Kashmir - which ripped its steel hull wide open. The Kashmir and the rest of the convoy sailed on, under orders not to give assistance for fear of U-boat attack. Image caption HMS Kashmir rammed into the Otranto and ripped its hull wide open Despite the ferocious weather, the Royal Navy destroyer, HMS Mounsey came to the rescue under the command of Lieutenant Francis Craven. ""In my viewpoint, Captain Craven was a real hero. Perhaps the real hero of the event"" said Chuck Freedman, whose grandfather, Sam Levy, was on the Otranto. Lieutenant Levy was among almost 600 soldiers who successfully jumped for their lives on to the deck of the Mounsey. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption Funeral of the victims of the Otranto at Kilchoman on Islay Many others tried and failed and were crushed to death between the two ships. By the time the Mounsey left the scene there were still hundreds of men aboard the sinking Otranto. Their best hope was to be swept towards one of the beaches on Islay's Atlantic coast. But that wasn't to be. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption Searching in the wreckage for bodies of victims of the US troopship Otranto The Otranto was lifted by a huge wave and dumped down onto a reef that broke its back and tore the ship to pieces. Only 21 men made it ashore alive. Some were pulled from the sea by members of Donald-James McPhee's family. They were shepherds and used their crooks to reach survivors - the length of their staffs, the distance between life and death. But this was largely a recovery operation with bodies piling up along the coast. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption American soldiers laid out for burial in the churchyard at Kilchoman ""It must have been so sad for them to see that"" said Mr McPhee. ""Waking up in the morning to a normal day's work and hundreds of dead bodies by the evening. It must have been horrendous."" Sergeant MacNeill painstakingly recorded the details of every body washed ashore, in a notebook which now has pride of place in the Museum of Islay life. Many of the victims were from the US state of Georgia, which is planning its own commemorations later this year. Image caption Sergeant MacNeill painstakingly recorded the details of every body washed ashore Some of the 700 victims of the Otranto and Tuscania disasters were never found. The majority were buried on Islay. After the war, the remains of the American soldiers were exhumed and returned home. Image caption Only one US serviceman is buried on Islay Image caption A monument was erected the year after the disaster Only one American - private Roy Muncaster - is still on the island. At the request of his family, he was left to rest where the people of Islay buried him. In 1918, the Tuscania disaster represented the biggest single loss of US military lives since the American civil war. Image caption Islay's rugged coastline was a difficult place to be shipwrecked The sinking of the Otranto accounted for some of America's heaviest losses at sea during the 1914-18 war. Yet the stories of these ships are not well known - lost perhaps in a century of Islay mist. There is a large lighthouse-shaped memorial on Islay's bleak Mull of Oa. But when I was growing up on the island, the troopships were rarely talked about. That's changing. Today, every child at my old school - Bowmore primary - is learning about them. On Friday 4 May, Princess Anne will lead commemorations on Islay to mark the centenary of these twin tragedies. These events will honour those who lost their lives and honour what the people of Islay did for those in peril on their shores a hundred years ago.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buying food. Under the plan, those who receive at least $90 a month from SNAP (the vast majority of recipients) would get about half of their benefits in the form of a “USDA Foods package,” which would include “items such as shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit, vegetables, and meat, poultry or fish” (in other words, no fresh food). Overall, the budget proposes cuts of $213 billion over ten years to the program. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP aids 40 million people, around 70 percent of which are in families with children. More than 25 percent of participants are in households with seniors or people with disabilities. Currently, SNAP recipients receive a loaded EBT debit card, which they can spend at grocery stores and other authorized retailers. Recipients cannot buy alcohol, cigarettes, vitamin supplements, hot foods or non-grocery household items (like toilet paper or diapers) with the money. The administration writes that this is a “cost-effective approach,” but it’s easy to see how this could be a disaster for people with any type of food allergy, as well as for people who do not have homes or addresses at which they can receive the boxes—and how it could ratchet up costs, considering all of the packaging and shipping costs involved. On Twitter, Annie Lowrey, an economic policy writer for The Atlantic, lays out some very good questions it appears the administration hasn’t fully considered. For example, what happens if there’s a snowstorm or hurricane? More fundamentally, “do poor folks deserve to get to choose their own food?” It’s a good thread worth considering in full.","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buyin…",2018-02-13T21:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Some Questions About Trump's New SNAP Proposal,https://twocents.lifehacker.com/some-questions-about-trumps-new-snap-proposal-1822964950,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--o8-u4HxK--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jvobwmaqvmp1as14aque.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,disaster,1
BeauHD,"If you talk to experts on election security (I studied with several of them in graduate school) they'll tell you that we're nowhere close to being ready for online voting. ""Mobile voting is a horrific idea,"" said election security expert Joe Hall when I asked him about a West Virginia experiment with blockchain-based mobile voting back in August. But on Tuesday, The New York Times published an opinion piece claiming the opposite. ""Building a workable, scalable, and inclusive online voting system is now possible, thanks to blockchain technologies,"" writes Alex Tapscott, whom the Times describes as co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute. Tapscott is wrong -- and dangerously so. Online voting would be a huge threat to the integrity of our elections -- and to public faith in election outcomes. Tapscott focuses on the idea that blockchain technology would allow people to vote anonymously while still being able to verify that their vote was included in the final total. Even assuming this is mathematically possible -- and I think it probably is -- this idea ignores the many, many ways that foreign governments could compromise an online vote without breaking the core cryptographic algorithms. For example, foreign governments could hack into the computer systems that governments use to generate and distribute cryptographic credentials to voters. They could bribe election officials to supply them with copies of voters' credentials. They could hack into the PCs or smartphones voters use to cast their votes. They could send voters phishing emails to trick them into revealing their voting credentials -- or simply trick them into thinking they've cast a vote when they haven't.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: If you talk to experts on election security (I studied with several of them in graduate school) they'll tell you that we're nowhere close to being ready for online voting.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Before jumping to how we handle crises and potential catastrophes, let's first consider more routine situations. Think about when you were last in a meeting, hammering out a new plan or strategy for your organization. Did team members keep pressing to get ""the right answer,"" and, when finished, did they bask in all that was good about it? Or rather did they unleash their most aggressive, destructive, diabolical thinking in order to stress test their ideas and identify weaknesses?
Related: Why Every Entrepreneur Must Be Prepared for Tough Times
More likely than not, they pushed for the pristine ""right."" Even if they (inadvertently) discovered problems and potential stumbling blocks along the way, team members probably didn't dig to figure out causes and corrective actions. Instead, they brushed off the possibility of an obstacle materializing with a, ""Oh, that'll never happen,"" or they dismissed it with, ""We'll figure it out on the fly.""
The fact is, problems happen all the time. But, when we have the greatest ability to address them with ample lead-time and lower costs -- when our ideas are still conceptual and haven't yet been acted on -- we don't.
It's a missed opportunity. Our brains have wondrous capacity for creative thinking and problem solving. Trouble is, they're incredibly slow at those functions, and most crises develop far faster than we can figure out what to do, so we get overwhelmed. Without the skills to manage the situation, we flee, fight or cower.
But, that's not inevitable. So, how might leaders and organizations ensure their teams are capable of responding in the event of a disaster?
Related: 3 Steps Effective Leaders Take When Dealing With Crisis
For starters, they can and should commit time in development processes to stress test plans to identify breaking points. Macabre imaginations are needed -- what if the emergency room loses power? What if a flock of geese cripple both airplane engines? What if market conditions shift against the team's investment strategy? Once they have their scenarios, they need to generate appropriate alternatives and then aggressively ""war game"" those to find flaws. The goal is to help make the team be ready for abnormal situations.
It's this approach that saved the day for Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and writer for The New Yorker. In an interview, he describes removing a patient's adrenal gland laparoscopically, a procedure he'd performed dozens of times; but this operation was more complex. The patient's tumor was behind his liver and burrowed firmly against his vena cava, the vessel that pumps blood to the heart.
Before the surgery, the team developed a list of what could go wrong and prepared how they'd react. For instance, the anesthesiologist arranged to have blood made available for transfusion just in case. And good thing. As Dr. Gawande detached the tumor, he nicked the patient's blood vessel, and the patient began bleeding seriously. Disaster was averted because the team's preparations meant the patient could be sustained while the hole was repaired. The patient survived, not because of impromptu heroism but because the team searched for and planned for the worst.
Deliberative thinking and fine-tuning emergency reactions in advance is critical; so, too, is practicing those responses. Take, for instance, what happened in July 1989 when United Airlines flight 232 had a mechanical failure in its tail engine that cost the plane its hydraulic controls. Such a failure had been completely catastrophic on other flights. Fortunately for UA 232, flight instructor Dennis Fitch was onboard, and he had rehearsed how to fly only with the engine throttles. He guided the crew to a controlled crash landing. More than half the passengers survived -- the death toll would have been much worse otherwise.
Related: Culture Makes or Breaks a Company When Crisis Hits
Leaders play a critical role in ingraining these behaviors. Because we humans are consumed with status, hierarchy and a need for self-esteem, it's not natural to seek flaws in our thinking -- particularly not with our colleagues' help. Instead, we want validation that our thinking is sound, and we get defensive if we're challenged. Put simply, once we've invested time and energy in an idea, we lose sight that what's important is not the plan itself, but how it'll work when put to use.
A friend, who works for an investment firm, bemoans that his analysts develop investment strategies and then ""pitch"" them to colleagues, emphasizing all that's good, while evading all concerns. They could take a different approach: Presenting the proposal as the product of their best thinking but then soliciting criticism. Better to be wrong in the conference room than in the market, after all.
To combat this tendency, leaders -- including my friend -- must demonstrate and coach team members how to articulate (and accept) misgivings, so that everyone can feel comfortable raising a hand and saying, ""This isn't going to work,"" or, ""What if we tried something different,"" or ""I'm having trouble tracking this.""
Things will go wrong -- sometimes at crisis level. However, catastrophe need not be the inevitable outcome if we aggressively seek faults in our thinking and correct them before they become faults in our doing.",How might leaders and organizations ensure their teams are capable of responding in the event of a disaster?,2018-12-20T15:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",Preempt Crises by Aggressively Seeking Solutions Before Problems Occur,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324662,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181214225051-GettyImages-680316391.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,disaster,1
Catie Keck,"It has not been an especially great week for Netflix or its polarizing monster flick Bird Box, which has spawned one of the most idiotic so-called challenges to surface in this cursed timeline were trapped in. In yet another public relations headache for the company, Netflix is now looking into whether actual footage of a deadly 2013 event in Canada appeared in Bird Box after it was discovered in at least one other production.
According to the Canadian Press, an early Bird Box scene involving a newscast about a mysterious phenomenon resulting in mass suicides appears to depict real footage of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster, one of the worst rail incidents in Canadas history. The incident occurred in the Québec town after a train transporting crude oil derailed and exploded, leaving 47 people dead.
Footage of the incident was recently discovered in an episode of the latest season of the science fiction series Travelers, which was produced by Toronto-based Peacock Alley Entertainment. The production companys president Carrie Mudd told the Canadian Press it got the imagery from stock footage supplier Pond5, whose spokesperson Tina Witoshkin told BuzzFeed News the footage was taken out of context and used in entertainment programming.
Pond5 apologized for the obvious oversight, telling BuzzFeed News that it deeply regret[s] that this happened and sincerely apologize[s] to anyone who was offended, especially the victims and their families. Mudd said in a separate statement that Peacock Alley Entertainment had no intention to dishonour the tragic events of 2013.
Both Mudd and a Netflix spokesperson reportedly told the Canadian Press that the images would be removed from the episode of Travelers in which they appear; as for Bird Box, Netflix told the outlet that it was investigating whether the footage shown in the film does indeed depict the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster.
Its not clear if the footage of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster has been used in other productions on the platform. However, as BuzzFeed News noted, Netflix was accused earlier this month of using footage from another fatal train crash that occurred in Belgium in 2010 in its film Death Note.
Bird Box has created some unique hassles for Netflix in recent weeks, not the least of which include the extremely moronic Bird Box challenge, which involves wearing blindfolds while wandering around and (in particularly unfortunate cases) operating a vehicle. The challenge recently prompted YouTuber Jake Paul to idiotically dash through traffic with his own eyes covered, a stunt he (of course) later uploaded to the platform. (At least YouTube seems to have pulled the cord on that mess.) Netflix has since asked that people please not do this.

The process is very easy. First, tear off a long piece of Press’n’Seal, and lay your necklaces on top of it with any bobbles hanging out over the edged of the wrap. Next, fold the wrap over the chains, and firmly press it against itself, sealing in the necklaces. Cut off any excess. Roll everything up, and place your little necklace package in your jewelry bag. If you’re feeling saucy, you can just toss the whole thing loose in your suitcase, backpack, or purse.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Tens of thousands of people fled their homes near Mount Agung A volcano on the Indonesian island of Bali has erupted for the first time in more than 50 years, the country's national disaster agency says. More than 140,000 people had fled their homes in recent months before Mount Agung began belching smoke 700m (2,300ft) above its summit on Tuesday. Nearly 1,600 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. So far, there have been no changes to flights in the region despite the eruption. A spokesperson for the national disaster agency said Mount Agung was undergoing phreatic eruptions, which happen when water beneath the ground or on the surface is heated by magma. Phreatic eruptions also took place during the catastrophic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, which killed 40,000 people. Media caption Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted Villagers near the mount were first told to leave in August when it started rumbling but were later allowed to return home. Since then the mount has been rumbling intermittently. Many of those who returned home have now been ordered to leave and stay overnight in village halls and temples a safe distance from the volcano. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. According to official estimates, the holiday island of Bali lost at least $110m (£83m) in tourism and productivity while locals were moved to shelters. However, the island's airport remains open with no changes to flights, and tourist areas are safe according to Indonesia's disaster agency.

Leigh Anderson,"Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report a klaxon, reallywarning of the catastrophic consequences of climate change if global political leaders dont take action right now. For people whove been sounding the alarm for decades now, this report is depressing but not surprising; for those of us whove not paid as much attention to the science as we should have, the report is a blaring wake-up call. No matter which group youre in, though, the path forward is clear: We need to pressure our elected leaders, corporations, and even our friends and neighbors to change our ways or we will be witnessing rising sea levels, natural disasters, war, famine and a refugee crisis the likes of which the world has never seen. As the New York Times writes, the world must utterly transform its energy systems in the next decade or risk ecological and social disaster. The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. In the face of enormous, apparently intractable social problems, individual action can seem puny and inconsequential. (And indeed, just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which can make your rinsing out your tuna cans seem like an absurd bit of private theater.) But collectively we actually can slow climate change: The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. As a citizen, a consumer, an investor, as a human being, you have the power to effect really great change. Heres how to get started. By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of Read more Read Know Where Your Elected Officials Stand If you think that everyones pretty much on board with the fact of climate change, youre in for a rude awakening: More than half of Congress are climate-change deniers (and are largely, but not exclusively, Republicans). Want to see how enlightened your rep is on the issue? Check out this handy list of all the climate-change deniers in Congress. You know the drill: Call, write, email, protest, and above all, vote. Communicating with the people that are supposed to represent you in government can sound like a Read more Read Focus on State and Local Government Municipalities, collectively, might be able to do more than Washington. After President Trump decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, a coalition of mayors pledged to meet the targets anyway. As Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who coordinated the effort, writes in the Times, More than 130 American cities have joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and all are determined to see that we meet our Paris goal. Start going to your city council meetings, or at least follow the reporters or environmental advocates who are covering those meetings. Does your city have a sustainability office or a committee on the environment? Does your local university have a sustainability office you can communicate with about local efforts? If you truly turn up nothing, check out the Climate Resilience Toolkit for step-by-step instructions on addressing climate change in your community. Who you vote for for mayor, or whos on your city council, is really important, says Brune. If you want your community to be powered by clean energy, you need to vote and agitate at the local level. The world is warming. Theres no longer any doubt of that. With a new report breaking down exactly Read more Read Brune also points out that governors who believe in and are addressing climate change have made more economic opportunity for their constituents: see New Jersey, Illinois, California, Massachusetts. So hold your governors feet to the fire and volunteer for the candidates you think have the best handle on the climate change/economic-opportunity intersection. For a quick way to check out how a federal candidate leans, go to the Sierra Clubs endorsement page. For state and local races, contact your local chapter of the Sierra Club some states offer legislative scorecards. Take Action Yourself The very first thing you have to do is take action yourself, says David Miller, the North American regional director for the C40 cities climate leadership group. When you talk to your elected officials and they ask, well, what are you doing? you want to have a ready answer. Do you take transit? Can you make choices in your own personal transportation? If you drive, can you take transit even one day a week? If you take transit, can you walk more, can you bike more?...Can you choose an electric vehicle over a gas-powered vehicle? Miller acknowledges that your personal action will depend on your personal circumstances, but that collectively these decisions can have a huge impact. A new report from the United Nations offers a terrifying and stark forecast of the immediate Read more Read You can ask yourself the same questions about dozens of relatively small lifestyle choices: Can you eat a more climate-friendly diet? Can you cut down on meat and animal products? (This doesnt have to mean going fully vegetarian or veganyou can just go reducetarian. Really, if you can just limit or eliminate beef and pork youd be doing a lot. ) Can you waste less food and compost the scraps? Food waste is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Is there a compost program [in your community? says Miller. Can you organize with others to push your municipal representatives to do something? Can you stop with all the disposables? I love a ziplock bag and a big cup of coffee as much as the next parent, but I try really hard to use reusable containers for lunches and to bring a to-go cup for coffee. If you want to get fanatical about never buying something, make it bottled water, a scourge upon the planet. Can you, in general, just buy less stuff? Especially plastic toys, for kids, which arent usually recyclable and arent in play for very long, anyway. The holidays are comingwhat if you gave and asked for experiences instead of things? Youd probably be happier. Can you make your home more energy-efficient ? Can you find out if your workplace is energy-efficient? If youre thinking about buying a new car, can you test drive a Bolt or a Prius ? Do you really need a car at all? Can you lobby for better transit and cycling lanes in your town or arrange a car pool with fellow commuters or parents? Who are you doing business with? Dont support banks that arent investing in solutions, says Brune, specifically calling out Bank of Americas support for fracking. Switch to a socially responsible bank. If you have investments, consider impact investing. Want more ideas, from the very easy dont put stuff on your car roof? to the even easier replace your lightbulbs? Check out these suggestions from the Natural Resources Defense Council. These efforts might seem inconsequential, like rinsing out the tuna cans, above, but if youre also leaning on your friends and neighbors, and your employer, and your local government, small actions will start to snowball. And regarding those 100 companies that are the big villains in climate change, Miller points out that changing your behavior to not support environmentally-damaging sectors of the economyby, for example, choosing public transit over carsyou are effecting change. Youre making choices with your pocketbook. A million small choices add up. For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty thatif we Read more Read Influence Your Friends and Neighbors Speaking up actually matters, says Miller. Building a political movement requires knowledgeable, engaged people who work together on an issue. If fighting climate change is your new passion, or even your old passion, dont keep it to yourself. And you dont have to take a finger-wagging tackstart with the positive: So many things are happening that are inspiring, says Miller. This is a movement that is based on making lives better. You can talk about how great electric cars are now, or how much youre enjoying the health benefits of cycling and dont want to be hit by a car (this is my personal strategy) or how cities around the world are buying fleets of electric buses. There are about a million reasons why we should eat less meat, considering its effects on our own Read more Read Its important to influence our elected officials, of course, but as the saying goes, there go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader. Changing representatives minds means changing their constituents minds. The most important thing to influence elected officials is a general understanding amongst people that something is the right thing to do, says Miller. This is also where Facebook activism comes ineven if youre just posting about what changes individuals can make, you might influence someone to re-think what kind of car they need, or even if they need a car at all. This doesnt have to mean scare-mongering or guilt-trippingkeeping a positive and helpful tone is critical. The posts from friends that make me listen usually involve events, like fundraising bike rides or postcard-writing partiesfun things that make activism social. Were doomed is not going to inspire anyone to do anything. The earth is getting warmer. Thats a fact. And as the earth gets warmer, we expect to see larger Read more Read Start With Your Personal Interests and Your Own Community I confess that while I have always been aware of climate change and vaguely hoping that politicians would do something, it hasnt been my number-one issue. But lately Ive gotten into cycling, and so follow a lot of transportation-alternatives types on social mediawhich has changed how I think about cars, transit, and cities...which in turn has changed what I talk about with friends. A lot of people come to this topic through their own personal perspective, says Brune: grandparents who want their children to have a future that isnt impoverished because of climate change, parents and teachers who organize to have a strong science-based curriculum in schools. Brune says, A lot of people may be more conservative politically, but they run a company or theyre active in the private sector, and want to make an economic argument in favor of taking action on climate change....We have seen people who organize through their church, to make a moral argument for why we should take stronger action in favor of clean energy. Weve seen all these things be effective in their own right, but when they are coordinated together, you have a cacophony of voices all calling for stronger leadership. So are you into education? Check out Climate Parents, follow the National Science Teachers Association, and attend your local school board meetings to find out what the science curriculum is in your kids school. Are you into gardening? Research how to get started with composting. Catholic? Read what the Pope has to say on climate change. (Jewish? Covered. Episcopalian? Covered.) Are you an engineer or architect ? Are you an African-American person who wants to get into camping, or a Latino person who wants to connect with nature ? Are you queer and interested in backpacking ? I am going to guess that no matter your identity, hobbies, interests, or passions, you can hook up with some group that is enjoying nature and fighting climate change. My personal next steps? Start going to my local meetings about transportation alternatives, and re-considering my banking. If youre stumped, look for your local chapter of the Sierra Club, or just find your greenest friend on Facebook and ask what to do. Weve got a decade to turn things around, so pour yourself a coffee in a reusable mug, make yourself a vegetarian snack, and start planning.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A tsunami that slammed into the beaches of Indonesias Sunda Strait over the weekend has reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 429 people.
While the cause is still unclear, scientists believe the event may have been caused by underwater landslides resulting from volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatoa. Saturdays tsunami struck the neighboring islands of Java and Sumatra without warning, sending people running for their lives. Horrifying video captured the wave slamming into a beachside concert, collapsing the stage as it plowed through to the audience.
Speaking with the Guardian, Dougal Jerram of the department of geosciences at the University of Oslo said tsunamis resulting from volcanic activity may not trigger warning systems that are designed to alarm after large quakes, and thus may provide little warning, unless observed directly or detected by other devices such as wave buoy warning systems.
Hundreds of homes and dozens of hotels were damaged in the disaster, and thousands of people have been displaced. More than 1,400 people were injured, CNN reported Tuesday, and dozens are still missing. The U.S. State Department said it is continuing to monitor the situation and that it is not aware of any U.S. citizens directly affected, but stand ready to assist as needed.
The U.S. Geological Survey, an agency that would normally provide data on the disaster, saw a massive staff reduction resulting from the government shutdown that could last through the new year and has stalled some operations. The Huffington Post reported the agency is operating with only 75 of its roughly 8,032 employees.
Authorities previously cautioned people in the area to avoid beaches around the Sunda Strait, per Reuters, noting a high-tide warning in place through Christmas Day. Residents were again warned on Monday to stay away from beaches over the possibility that another tsunami could strike.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of Indonesias National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that it is warning people to remain cautious, according to CNN. Nugroho added: Agencies are still continuing to analyze the root cause ... the Krakatau volcano continues to erupt, which could potentially trigger another tsunami.

MALCOLM ROBERTS,"So, are you worried now? Probably not. Thus, humans continue to take chances. And when they get away with them, they take more chances. Conversely, when they lose, they learn. Unfortunately, they usually learn only when they lose. Given this conundrum, I propose that we in the insurance/disaster management world try something new. We need to find ways for people to encounter disasters without actually living through them. We call it pre-experiencing disaster. Were trying this at my workplace for clients and would-be clients. We create six-story controlled warehouse fires and trigger actual explosions. We simulate hurricanes, floods and cyberattacks. We have a platform that mimics the motion of an earthquake and shows how violently and unpredictably a building will move, and even rotate, when the ground shakes. Our visitors feel the heat from the fire. They cringe as a two-by-four hurtles across a room in a simulated hurricane. Their bodies absorb the concussion of an explosion. When they leave, they seem converted. We need to do this kind of education in a broader way that reaches people and businesses in vulnerable communities, places that face threats from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, flooding and wildfires. In schools, we need to weave disaster and denial stories into classes on physics, earth science psychology, engineering, finance, statistics and the building trades. We need to find ways to tell the stories of people who suffered because of their denial, and who survived because they took the right precautions and built in the proper safeguards. Communities at potential risk should bring in engineers and emergency workers to point out what could fail, wash away, freeze, rot, short-circuit, explode, shatter, cave in or burn up.","United Cajun Navy volunteers make their way to a house to rescue a family stranded by rising floodwaters in Wilmington, N.C., on Sept. 15, 2018.",2018-10-11T16:14:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why We Ride Out Life-Threatening Storms and Do Other Crazy Things,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/hurricanes-disasters-denial-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/11/opinion/11roberts/11roberts-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,disaster,1
