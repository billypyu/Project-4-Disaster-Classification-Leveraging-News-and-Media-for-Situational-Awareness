Benjamin Plackett,"""They found a mobile on my nephew,"" said Fatima, lifelong Mosul resident. ""They tied him to a post, poured gasoline on him and set fire to him.""
She's not alone. Almost everyone in Mosul has lost someone at some point in the past few years. This place has taken a beating, first from the advance of ISIS, then from the coalition forces that ousted the terrorists and finally from the various explosive booby traps left by ISIS in fridges, televisions and light switches for returning refugees.
June 4, 2014, was the day it all started to go wrong for Mosul.
Armies flying the black flags of ISIS approached the city, and it took them just six days to occupy the governor's office, take control of the city's television and radio networks, and capture the airport. Many policemen and government soldiers simply abandoned their posts and retreated as the militants rolled into town.
Mosul -- Iraq's second-largest city -- was a relatively easy acquisition for ISIS. By June 10, the victorious insurgents were walking the city's streets unchallenged.
A couple of weeks after ISIS took the city in June 2014, the organization's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, officially proclaimed a caliphate from the Great Mosque of al-Nuri. He also took the opportunity to declare himself Emir of the Islamic State and ruler of all Muslims everywhere. It wasn't long after the grandiose proclamations that harrowing tales of Mosul's treatment began to creep out.
Keen to win the propaganda war just as much as the battlefield skirmishes, ISIS decided to turn off the internet. But there was a problem. Most people in Mosul were connected to the internet by their phone's 3G signal rather than a broadband modem, and those phones could still get reception from the cell towers on the other side of the front line.
The answer was confiscation, and to severely punish anyone who disobeyed.
""If they were searched and found to have a mobile, ISIS would take them.""
""For years, it felt like we had gone backward. We had gone back to the Stone Age,"" said Fatima.
The militants went door to door through the city of approximately 1 million on a mission to commandeer SIM cards, televisions and satellites. When they'd expunged a street of their devices, they'd mark houses at the end of the street with green spray paint and move on.
""Anyone who was caught on the phone or with a mobile in their hand -- or if they were searched and found to have a mobile -- ISIS would take them,"" said Jamal, a 47-year-old shopkeeper from Mosul.
Ali, a 25-year-old mechanic from Mosul, has a story similar to Fatima's.
""My brother was executed for using his mobile phone,"" he said.
Ali's brother lived in the Wadi Hajar district of Mosul, which was known for its loyalty to the Iraqi army. ISIS would frequently and without warning raid the area, looking for an excuse to murder.
""They gathered all of us in mosques and schools and raided all the houses in the neighborhood,"" said Ali. One day they found a phone in his brother's house, and even though it didn't have a SIM card, they executed him by firing squad. ""They tied him to a post -- not only him, many people. They shot him with guns,"" remembered Ali.
This reign of fear worked.
For years, most of Mosul was offline and its people ignorant of what was happening outside of their city. They had no idea if their relatives who had managed to escape were safe, and they didn't know if a liberating army was near or if it would ever come.
""We were isolated from the world,"" said Fatima. ""We didn't know what was going on. We used to sleep unsure if we would be alive in the morning. In the day, we weren't sure if we would be alive by the evening. They let us live in horror, fear, destruction, death, illness and hunger.""
Others said the same.
""We felt isolated and disconnected from the entire world,"" said Jamal.
The toll of that isolation and the violence that came with it is clear.
In contrast to the conquest of Mosul, when the fight to liberate the city finally did come in 2017, the battle lasted an unforgiving 10 months.","This article was produced in partnership with Point, a YouTube channel for investigative journalism.

Sarah Scoles,"I first heard about Colorado’s Spring Fire on July 1, when I was driving back from a camping trip. My mom texted me from her home in Florida: “How close are these fires?” I pulled over to a rest stop, called up the federal disaster website Inciweb, and sent her back a screenshot of the wildfire’s perimeter. It seemed far away from my house on the Huerfano County line, like it would have to cross impossible acres to even come close. “Looks like we’re good,” I wrote back. The Spring Fire is the third largest in the state’s history. By the time I learned about it, the fire had already burned through more than 40,000 acres. A plume of smoke unfurled into a constantly replenished mushroom cloud. It was 0 percent “contained,” meaning that no human-made or natural barrier was stopping the fire’s edge from expanding. Costilla and Huerfano counties had evacuated around 2,000 households by July 2. The fire had, by then, grown to more than 56,000 acres, just 5 percent contained. I arrived at my cabin on the 3rd, hose in hand, knowing I couldn’t really help the house but not knowing what else to do. The Spring Fire had bloomed to nearly 80,000 acres. The Department of Transportation closed the highway right at the turnoff to my place. Big-bellied planes full of retardant crossed the sky overhead, their flight path traversing part of the bullishly-named Wet Valley. That night, the sunset, reflecting off the smoke particles, was spectacular. The mountains all looked like they were on fire—even the ones that weren’t. Forty miles south, from their base in the Huerfano county seat of Walsenburg, a group called Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team had taken charge of taming and containing the northern section of the blaze; another team, Rocky Mountain Area Incident Management Team Black, was assigned to deal with the southern portion. To direct the emergency response personnel—nearly 1,800 people worked the fire at its peak—the group needed a lot of data, a tightly wound plan, and a weirdly Office Space organizational structure. Fire behavior analyst Shelly Crook, Blue Team, is key to that endeavor. She’s in charge of figuring out what the northern portion of the fire is doing and what it will do. Every morning during the Spring Fire, she has woken up in the bed she keeps in the back of her car. By 5 am, she shows up at the ad hoc incident command post—at John Mall High School—to see if an infrared plane went out overnight. “I take stock of that data, and see where the fire moved from the previous perimeter, to see how much it has grown,” she says. This is Crook’s fourth fire this year, and when we spoke, it was her 60th day in the field (she is “retired”). “When a fire starts, you kind of drop everything,” she says. And so did the other Western-based members of her team, who converged quickly on the Spring Fire after the call went out from the Geographic Area Coordination Center, which helps mobilize emergency resources. At their temporary command post in Walsenburg, they have all the divisions a business might, including finance types, HR reps, and PortaPotty procurers. Every day, a planning team writes out a 30-page packet of information about everything a firefighter might need, from which frequencies to use for communications to what the weather will be like. For that latter part, there’s a dedicated meteorologist. He sits next to Crook as part of a unit that prints more than 150 maps every day—county roads and structures, topography from the US Geological Survey, GPS locations from the ground. After Crook checks on the infrared flight, she gets information from her officemate about the relative humidity recovery—she’s hoping that it increased significantly overnight. “If it’s good, the fire is not going to be active as early,” she says. They dig into data from weather stations—permanent ones and seven RAWS, remote automated weather systems, specially installed at critical Spring Fire locations—informing a forecast Crook will present during morning meetings. That’s just the beginning of Crook’s day, which she dedicates to predicting—as best she can—the north fire’s next moves. That kind of information eventually makes its way to the community—via in-person meetings and daily one-sheets. The public document released on the Fourth of July waffled in its optimism. “Overnight, calmer winds and lighter fuels slowed fire growth along the south and east flanks of the North Spring Fire,” it said. “Fire activity increased along the northwest flank near Sheep Mountain as it moved into dry, mixed timber.” By the afternoon, data from an infrared flight revealed the fire’s total extent to be 95,739 acres. The preevacuation zone, shown on a Google map, now stretched to two miles from my house. To the south, the view from the porch had morphed into a wall of smoke. I did the things on a preevacuation checklist, just in case: take down curtains, close and unlock windows, turn off the gas, turn on the lights, bring everything in off the porch. I used the hose to fill buckets with water and place them around the house. I didn’t need to (pre-pre-evacuation is just non-evacuation), but my nerves had history: When I was 12, a Florida wildfire destroyed 30 structures in my rural area, and my family didn’t get out in time: On our path down the highway, the road was blocked by fire, and we spent hours in a landfill entryway, surrounded by flames. There are concrete steps individual citizens can take to become more firewise in general: get the gunk out of gutters, clear defensible no-brush space around your house, keep wood piles and propane a few dozen feet away, screen all openings so embers don’t sneak in. But sometimes, despite best efforts, Mother Nature wields an upper hand. By this point in the fire, on the Fourth, more than 100 homes had been lost. At six p.m., I tuned in to the community briefing, streamed via Facebook Live from the small town of La Veta. “Happy Fourth of July, everybody,” said David Detray, fire chief of the La Veta area. “I want to give you this picture of your La Veta Fire Protection District personnel.” On the screen behind him, eight firefighters, two holding American flags and one holding a giant teddy bear, stood in a V, seemingly paused in a march through an otherwise empty street. This picture was from the main street in Cuchara, an 8,500-foot-high village that had been evacuated. Citizens couldn’t hold their annual Independence Day parade, which they’ve done for some 50 years. So the firefighters took a moment to stage a miniature, kind of morbid one for them. “These are your people,” Detray said. In the Blue Team’s update, operations section chief Chris Zoller noted where the fire had been “pushing,” expanding its edge by 6,000 to 7,000 acres. He moved on to an area, full of trees, where the fire would soon hit a road and move into a region called “Paradise Acres.” “This is going to be our trouble area for the next 24 hours,” he says. After presenting her initial forecast at Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team morning meetings, Crook goes right back into prediction mode. She feeds information into models that forecast the fire’s behavior, part of the Wildland Fire Decision Support System —a powerful tool that gobbles up data from multiple sources to support wildfire strategy-making. Some of the information it sucks in comes from a federal program called Landfire, which can help firefighters tell what is growing on the affected ground, how it burns, and how topography flows beneath it. Although the support system itself is much newer, these federal prediction models have been in development for around 30 years. “They’ve morphed and become more robust,” says Crook. Crook has two favorites: the three-day perimeter projection, and the fire spread probability prediction. “It tells me over the course of the next seven to 14 days what is the probability of the fire impacting any point on the landscape,” she says. But simulations can only simulate. So in the afternoon, Crook heads out with the firefighters and comes back with ground truth. She can feed specific information back into the models—essentially calibrating them to the North Spring Fire. Still, it’s not a perfect system. “There’s a bit of a mystery on every fire,” she says. There’s also a bit of logistical challenge: Not just where to put the PortaPotties but also how to get the humans and heavy equipment you need. When the Spring Fire started and Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team showed up on the scene, the fire was already moving fast. They needed to act. But the rest of the state also seemed to be on fire. “It took like four days before I was able to get the resources to even come close to what we needed to help start suppressing the fire,” says Jay Esperance, the Blue Team’s incident commander. But that, he says, is life. “There’s only so many firefighters and equipment, and we were the new show in town.” Once the heavy machinery did arrive, it was substantial: At one point, there were 17 bulldozers to clear out lines of land to contain the blaze; two “masticators” to chew up brush and other small-diameter stuff; and skidders to move logs. In addition to ground-bound resources, the Spring Fire fighters also took to the sky. They used planes and helicopters, although Zoller calls them “fixed-wing” and “rotor-wing” aircraft. The planes that combated this blaze—stashed in fire-prone regions across the country during the volatile season—included single-engine flyers and VLATs : Very Large Air Tankers. Both carried fire retardant that spilled from their bellies like paintball powder. The helicopters took care of the H 2 O. “Water is for the immediate need to cool things down,” says Zoller. Retardant, meanwhile, slows the fire down. Above the winged craft flies an “eye in the sky”: an in-the-air air-traffic controller. “He directs all the traffic, and keeps the rotor-wing out of the way of the fixed-wing,” says Zoller. Because the last thing anyone needs during a wildfire is a plane crash. At a July 11 evacuee meeting in Fort Garland, which once hosted a functional military fort, a southern-section public information officer took the stage. “We’re going to start off with some good news,” she said. The entire fire was 83 percent contained, and the southern perimeter was entirely under control. Team Black was going home. Crook’s Blue Team took over the whole operation, which, two days later, was 91 percent contained. The northern edge of the fire stayed far enough from my house that I never had to evacuate, and the Blue Team soon packed up, leaving operations to local teams on July 16. On their way out of town, they decontaminated their equipment, to avoid transporting invasive species, “weed-washing” the outside with high-pressure hoses and burning the insides of tanks with 140-degree water. The path to recovery will be long and hard, like the roads that climb up through the high mountain passes here. According to the Denver Post, the area has brought in the disaster cleanup nonprofit Team Rubicon to help, and a group called the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster will assist, too. More than 225 structures were destroyed, according to a July 18 report from the National Interagency Coordination Center. What was forest is charred trunks, scorched earth. And no matter how much data anyone or any satellites take, it’s impossible to predict exactly what will happen next for the communities. But if one of Crook’s models could provide imperfect post-fire forecasts, it would probably say that life will slowly grow back toward normal.

Oliver Milman,"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
The conscientious citizens of Philadelphia continue to put their pizza boxes, plastic bottles, yogurt containers, and other items into recycling bins. But in the past three months, half of these recyclables have been loaded onto trucks, taken to a hulking incineration facility, and burned, according to the citys government.
Its a situation being replicated across the US as cities struggle to adapt to a recent ban by China on the import of items intended for reuse.
The loss of this overseas dumping ground means that plastics, paper, and glass set aside for recycling by Americans is being stuffed into domestic landfills or is simply burned in vast volumes. This new reality risks an increase of plumes of toxic pollution that threaten the largely black and Latino communities who live near heavy industry and dumping sites in the US.
About 200 tons of recycling material is sent to the huge Covanta incinerator in Chester City, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, every day since Chinas import ban came into practice last year, the company says.
People want to do the right thing by recycling but they have no idea where it goes and who it impacts, said Zulene Mayfield, who was born and raised in Chester and now spearheads a community group against the incinerator, called Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living. People in Chester feel hopelessall they want is for their kids to get out, escape. Why should we be expendable? Why should this place have to be burdened by peoples trash and shit?
Some experts worry that burning plastic recycling will create a new fog of dioxins that will worsen an already alarming health situation in Chester. Nearly four in 10 children in the city have asthma, while the rate of ovarian cancer is 64 percent higher than the rest of Pennsylvania and lung cancer rates are 24 percent higher, according to state health statistics.
The dilemma with what to do with items earmarked for recycling is playing out across the U.S. The country generates more than 250 million tons of waste a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, with about a third of this recycled and composted. Until recently, China had been taking about 40 percent of US paper, plastics, and other recyclables, but this trans-Pacific waste route has now ground to a halt. In July 2017, China told the World Trade Organization it no longer wanted to be the end point for yang laji, or foreign garbage, with the country keen to grapple with its own mountains of waste.
Since January 2018, China hasnt accepted two dozen different recycling materials, such as plastic and mixed paper, unless they meet strict rules around contamination. The imported recycling has to be clean and unmixeda standard too hard to meet for most American cities.
It is virtually impossible to meet the stringent contamination standards established in China, said a spokesperson for the city of Philadelphia, who added that the cost of recycling has become a major impact on the citys budget, at around $78 a ton. Half of the citys recycling is now going to the Covanta plant, the spokesperson added.
There isnt much of a domestic market for US recyclablesmaterials such as steel or high-density plastics can be sold on, but much of the rest holds little more value than rubbishmeaning that local authorities are hurling it into landfills or burning it in huge incinerators like the one in Chester, which already torches around 3,510 tons of trash, the weight equivalent of more than 17 blue whales, every day.
This is a real moment of reckoning for the US because of a lot of these incinerators are aging, on their last legs, without the latest pollution controls, said Claire Arkin, campaign associate at Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. You may think burning plastic means poof, its gone but it puts some very nasty pollution into the air for communities that are already dealing with high rates of asthma and cancers.
Hugging the western bank of the Delaware River, which separates Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Chester City was once a humming industrial outpost, hosting Ford and General Motors plants. Over recent decades, though, Chester has been hollowed out, with an exodus of jobs ushering in an era where a third of people live in poverty. The industry that remains emits a cocktail of soot and chemicals upon a population of 34,000 residents, 70 percent of them black. Theres a wastewater treatment plant, a nearby Kimberly-Clark paper mill, and a medical waste facility. And then theres Covantas incinerator, one of the largest of its kind in the US.
Just a tiny fraction of the trash burned at the plant is from Chesterthe rest is funneled in via truck and train from as far as New York City and North Carolina. The burning of trash releases a host of pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, and particulate matter, which are tiny fragments of debris that, once inhaled, cause an array of health problems.
Its difficult to single out the exact cause of any cancer, but a host of studies have identified possible links between air pollution and ovarian and breast cancers, which are unusually prevalent in Chester. A 1995 report by the EPA found that air pollution from local industry provides a large component of the cancer and noncancer risk to the citizens of Chester.
There are higher than normal rates of heart disease, stroke, and asthma in Chester, which are all end points for poor air, said Marilyn Howarth, a public health expert at the University of Pennsylvania who has advised Chester activists for the past six years. She added that residents now risk a worsened exposure to pollution due to increased truck traffic rumbling through their streets, bringing recycling to the plant. Once burned, plastics give off volatile organics, some of them carcinogenic. It is difficult to link any single case of cancer, heart disease, or asthma directly to a particular source. However, the emissions from Covanta contain known carcinogens so they absolutely increase the risk of cancer to area residents.
Covanta says that pollution controls, such as scrubbers in smokestacks, will negate toxins emitted by recyclables. After passing through the emissions control system, the plants eventual output is comfortably below limits set by state and federal regulators, the company says, with emissions of dioxins far better than the expected standard.
In terms of greenhouse gases, its better sending recyclables to an energy recovery facility because of the methane that comes from a landfill, said Paul Gilman, Covantas chief sustainability officer. Fingers crossed Philadelphia can get their recycling program going again because these facilities arent designed for recyclables, they are designed for solid waste.
Covanta and its critics agree that the whole recycling system in the US will need to be overhauled to avoid further environmental damage. Just 9% of plastic is recycled in the US, with campaigns to push up recycling rates obscuring broader concerns about the environmental impact of mass consumption, whether derived from recycled materials or not.
The unfortunate thing in the United States is that when people recycle they think its taken care of, when it was largely taken care of by China, said Gilman. When that stopped, it became clear we just arent able to deal with it.

And if youre out of town for business you should see if they have a free shoe-shine kit and complimentary pressings to make sure you dont have any wrinkles before a big meeting. 
While most minibar items are for sale, many hotels will provide a free bottle of water each day, which can come in handy if youre planning to do a lot of walking. 
And if you consider upgrading to a suite, then you may get a complimentary fruit basket, chocolates or bottle of wine, Kaler says (though of course, that likely doesnt offset the cost of the more expensive room). 
Apart from free goodies, many hotels lend out necessary items for free or for a small charge, like umbrellas if you wake up to an unexpected downpour or even workout gear if you forgot your own and want to use the gym. 
Hotel expert Tiffany Dowd says shes taken advantage of that perk at some Westin hotels, which will let you borrow New Balance shorts, a shirt, socks and shoes for just $5. And they even let you keep the socks, for obvious reasons.
Many hotels also now provide yoga mats in their rooms in case you dont want to head out of your room for exercise.

Food and Drink
Speaking of wine, you should look out for wine and cheese mixers with hotel staff. Most placesfrom Kimpton to the Jane hotels in New York will host them, experts say, and you just need to check with staff about when theyre taking place. 
Thats a really nice perk, Kaler says. Instead of going out and spending $15 on glass of wine, you can just go to the hotel and get a couple glasses and have a little cheese and that will tide you over until dinner.
That can also be a good way to get to know a hotel manager and/or concierges who can lend tons of advice about maximizing your time during your visit. 
Some other upscale spots, like the Greenwich Hotel in New York, may provide a free basket of snacks and candies, Dowd says. Certain hotels, including the Dorchester in London, may even replenish your snack or fruit basket each day.
You should also always make sure to check if your hotel provides a free breakfast. The quality at most places has been improving, experts say, and its an easy way to save money on one meal per day.

Concierge Services and Transportation
Many travelers fail to take advantage of one of the best resources a hotel provides, concierges who are not only experts on whats going on culturally, but can help snag you a table at that impossible-to-get-into restaurant. 
These people are the most networked people in the city, Dowd says. Its not just about getting a dinner reservation, its getting a good table.
The concierge can also help you get prime theater tickets, that perfect gift for a loved one, or even help you plan a proposal. 
You should also check with your concierge about house vehicles. Some hotels have a few cars on hand that will drive you for free within a certain radius. 
Kaler says she was checking out of the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan and was ready to schlep to the subway with her bags when the manger stopped her and said there was a car at the ready to take her from midtown to her home on the nearby Upper West Side. 
Bottom Line: Just Ask
Hotels are in the business of serving you, so if youre unsure if an item or service is provided, dont be shy about askingeven before you get there.

Steve Dent,"Verizon (Engadget's parent company) wrote a serious letter, tut-tutting AT&amp;T for the move without mentioning them by name. ""The potential to over-hype and under-deliver on the 5G promise is a temptation that the wireless industry must resist,"" it said.

T-Mobile, however, took another tack more fitting its corporate personality by roundly mocking its rival on Twitter. ""Didn't realize it was this easy, brb updating,"" it wrote under a video showing someone simply taping a ""9G"" sticker onto an iPhone.
Both companies are making the same point: It's highly dishonest to claim that old technology is new. Even though LTE has improved over time thanks to carrier aggregation, 256 QAM, 4x4 MIMO and other buzzwords, the tech is still completely different from mmWave, i.e., 5G. Also, unless you have a brand new smartphone that supports the tech, you won't benefit from all the MIMO and QAM anyway.

Rhett Jones,"In a little over a year, MoviePass has burned through the goodwill of its customers almost as fast as its burned through investor cash. But on Thursday, the company claimed it will be bringing back the one feature that made anyone care about its theater subscription service: Unlimited movies for a flat fee.
MoviePass has existed for eight years but most people had never heard of it until it introduced a radical new pricing plan in late 2017 that allowed subscribers to see a movie a day in a theater for $10 per month. At first, the biggest problem was that it wasnt prepared to sign up so many people at once and didnt have enough membership cards for everyone.
As time went on, the problems overflowed. In the second quarter of 2018, it lost $100 million paying movie theaters full price for tickets in a long-shot hope that its data collection and user base would become extraordinarily valuable in the future. To stop the bleeding, its made countless changes to its pricing plans and which movies subscribers were allowed to see. In fact, it just implemented a new three-tiered pricing plan this month. The celebrate the new plan, MoviePass has a new-new plan thats apparently kind of like the old plan. Khalid Itum, executive VP of MoviePass, told Variety that some sort of unlimited program that allows subscribers to go to all the movies they want will be back next week. 
Itum sat down to speak with Variety about a new marketing push that MoviePass is doing thats designed to build a better relationship with theaters. Its a glossy, high-profile print and billboard blitz that carries the tagline: Lets go to the movies. Are you excited yet? No? Thats because no one could possibly care about that. Im only imparting this worthless knowledge to explain that Itum didnt elaborate on how much the new unlimited plan would cost or give any details at all. Maybe it just popped into his head right there on the spot. We have no clue and MoviePass did not immediately respond to our request for more information.
Currently, MoviePass offers three plans ranging from $10 to $25 per month. Each plan has different limits and, in the case of the most expensive plan, different prices depending on where you live. Constantly changing how the system works has confused customers and the fact that the system has often failed to work at all has caused many people to just give up on it. Itum told Variety that the new plans are maybe, sort of, making people happy:
After losing customers steadily, MoviePass says it has started to regain subscribers. It has also seen consumer sentiment improve. Prior to launching the new plans, only 44% of customers had a positive feeling towards MoviePass, according to data collected by NetBase. Last week, that rose to 59% of respondents having a positive view.
I feel like were turning a corner, said Itum.
The bottom line is you should probably watch out for a new unlimited plan next week if you loved the glory days of MoviePass subsidizing your filmgoing but it probably wont be how you remember it. As we noted, MoviePass has been around for many years and it used to get by charging up to $50 per month for unlimited movies. Thats still a deal for some people but its also the cost of around eight Hulu subscriptions. Now that MoviePass has gotten a ton of very expensive publicity, its likely edging back towards its old ways.
Itum also said that MoviePass plans to start offering its platform and technology to theaters so that they can launch their own subscriptions. This seems like the more realistic future when it comes to the Netflix-for-theaters business model. Well likely see the whole thing splinter into a bunch of little subscriptions and your local theater owner will offer what works best for them.
Did you know MoviePasss production company was nominated for an Oscar this week? Yep. Did you know MoviePass even has a production company? ¯\_()_/¯ MoviePass is throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. If we get another great deal for a brief period of time, thats great. But were insanely skeptical that this company will ever get it together.

"A.A. Newton on Skillet, shared by A.A. Newton to Lifehacker","Anyone who’s ever put their wallet through the washing machine has wondered what to do with a ruined wad of cash. Your local bank can replace a few torn bills, but if your emergency cash has been petrified, burned to a crisp, partially digested, or otherwise severely damaged, you’ll need to call in the professionals. Most people don't keep large sums of cash around the house. But if you have a sizable amount… Read more Read The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is the arm of the United States Treasury responsible for actually printing the bills distributed by the Federal Reserve; as the experts on printing currency, it makes sense they’d also be the experts on restoring it, and that’s exactly what the Mutilated Currency Division does. Each year, their team of about twenty people processes more than twenty thousand claims—and pays out roughly forty million dollars in reimbursements. This video from Great Big Story shows the painstaking process in a bit more detail: If you have damaged currency to submit, be sure to read the official guidelines for claim submission. The number-one requirement: disturb the currency as little as humanly possible when packing it up for shipping. This means you shouldn’t attempt to separate bills that have fused together, and if your cash was damaged in a purse or box—or, in one case, an animal stomach—carefully pack up the whole container and send it in. (It’s worth mentioning that the BEP only handles paper currency; if you have damaged coins you’d like replaced, submit them to the United States Mint according to their redemption program guidelines.) Handling and counting mutilated currency is sensitive, tedious, and unpredictable work, so claim processing takes a very long time—anywhere from six to thirty-six months, according to the BEP website. Still, it’s comforting to know that even utterly ruined cash can feasibly be replaced.","Anyone who’s ever put their wallet through the washing machine has wondered what to do with a ruined wad of cash.

BOB LITTERMAN,"This means that electric utilities, in particular, and other businesses more generally have to rethink how they prepare for dangerous fire conditions and other impacts of climate change. These impacts are only growing. The thousand-year flood is now a regular event. The future will also bring further sea level rise, stronger hurricanes, storm surges, droughts, heat waves and wildfires beyond historical precedent. PG&amp;E has noted that more than half of the companys vast service area of 70,000 square miles is now considered to be in extreme or high fire-risk areas. No doubt much of the considerable cost of girding against these conditions will fall on rate payers.
So what should electric utilities threatened by the potential for wildfires do? It may require better protecting grid infrastructure and being more prepared to shut off power when wildfire risk is especially high. Homeowners and businesses must be prepared when the grid is turned off and will require backup sources of electricity for critical needs.
But utilities arent alone in facing climate threats. For transportation companies, for example, it may require hardening infrastructure like port facilities or rail lines to protect them from floods or fires. Fossil fuel companies may be forced to deal with stranded assets like oil fields and coal seams that have been bought but wont be developed as society moves away from coal and oil. For others, like insurance companies, it may provide business opportunities. And for many entrepreneurs it may lead to completely new products and services.
Risk managers at these companies will need to consider scenarios that have never happened before. Investors will need to assess the climate risks embedded in their portfolios and must demand greater transparency from the managers of the companies that they own.
However, for society at large, and the government in particular, the most important and urgent action required is to minimize future warming by creating appropriate global incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. Economists generally agree that rather than regulate behavior, it is more effective to allow individuals to choose their actions, as long as the prices appropriately reflect the costs, including the risks posed by climate change.",A firefighter checked out burned vehicles and a fallen power line after the Camp Fire in California in November.,2019-01-29T19:09:38Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Very High Costs of Climate Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/opinion/climate-wildfires-bankruptcy-california.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/opinion/29Litterman/29Litterman-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1

TIM HERRERA,"Stop d igging When I’m feeling burned out it’s usually because I’m overwhelmed. Tell me if you’ve ever been here: Sometimes I get to the point where my only response to dealing with everything I’m putting off is to … keep putting it off. (In fact, there’s science behind why we do this.) But just the act of getting started and accomplishing a few tiny things can have a big impact on one’s wellness. Studies have even shown that setting and achieving tiny goals can lead to increased dopamine levels in the brain, and that “ordinary, incremental progress can increase people’s engagement in the work and their happiness during the workday.” So just get started: Slice up whatever is on your to-do list into the tiniest components possible, then just knock out that first one. Then the second. Then the third. Progress begets progress. (Read more: Micro-Progress and the Magic of Just Getting Started.) Take time to recover Last Thursday I took a half-day for mental health: I got lunch at my favorite restaurant, went for ice cream, then spent the afternoon relaxing, and I was in bed early for a full night’s rest. I came back to work Friday relaxed and refreshed. This seems obvious, but experts say that taking time for yourself and unplugging when you’re stressed can be a quick trick for relieving burnout, even that just means a coffee break or a long lunch. Talk to someone Christina Maslach, a pioneering researcher behind the study of burnout, told us that interacting with other people can be the strongest antidote to burnout. “What we found is that people’s health, well-being, everything in life, is way better if you’re connected with other people,” she said. “That social network, that each of you have each other’s back, that they’re there for you and you’re there for them, that’s like money in the bank. That’s a precious, precious resource.” In that spirit, talk to me about your burnout.

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said. Referring to the human causes of wildfire, he added that “education is still a really big problem. There are many people who are oblivious to the dangers and volatility of forests.”","Firefighters battled the Mendocino Complex Fire this month.

MITCH SMITH,"“We may not be able to feed the cows enough to gain weight,” said Michael Kelsey of the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association, which has been taking donations to provide hay and other supplies. “But if we can feed the cows enough to maintain, we’re in good shape. That’s just the reality of the disaster.” Rhett Smith’s ranch on a gravel road outside Taloga, Okla., was directly in the flames’ path. Unlike some of his neighbors, Mr. Smith saved his house and his 100 cows. But his grass was gone. So when two tractor-trailers carrying 64 bales of hay rolled down Mr. Smith’s winding driveway, a sense of relief washed over him. The hay would be enough to feed his cattle and his neighbors’ herds for at least a few weeks. The trucks were driven by Levi Smith and his brother, Blake, who raise cattle about 100 miles from Vici, along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. The brothers had never met Rhett Smith before — and are no relation to him — but they said they empathized with all he was going through. Their family’s land burned last year, the brothers said. And donated hay had gotten their cattle through it. Photo Eddie Fahley tossed a strap to Matt Schaller in Vici, Okla., as they secured a load of hay for a rancher whose land burned. Credit Mitch Smith/The New York Times “They think it can’t get any worse,” Levi Smith said, “but when these loads of hay come in, it gives you hope.” In the sparsely populated counties where cattle roam, people rely on neighbors and take pride in giving help without being asked. Signs around Vici (which is pronounced “Vy-Sigh”) offer free meals, free clothes, free care for orphaned calves. In nearby Lenora, hay bales are stacked along the side of a road for whoever might need them. As eager as people are to assist, they also seem reluctant to receive. “Nobody wants to take any help if they don’t have to,” said Nick Campbell, a town trustee in Vici. “We’re trying to get them to understand that we’re there for them, whatever they need.” The Oklahoma fires, which burned an area about the size of Chicago and New York City put together, made relatively few national headlines. But in agricultural circles — and especially in places that have seen their own fires — word of the destruction spread swiftly. Prairie fires are a fact of life on the Great Plains, but recent years have brought a series of unusually strong, multiday blazes that set records and spread out of control. When Travis Brown lost much of his pasture in Montana’s fires last summer, other ranchers sent hay. Photo Firefighters struggled to fight a fire near Seiling, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford/Reuters So when Mr. Brown heard about the new fires in Oklahoma, he and three other Montana ranchers paid about $940 each to send more than 100 hay bales to Oklahoma. “I remember the feeling of just being overwhelmed after seeing so much of our livelihood burned,” Mr. Brown said. “The smoke hadn’t event cleared away yet, and people are saying, ‘You’re going to be O.K.’” Around Vici and Taloga, where drivers greet passing trucks with a wave and the skyline is dotted with wind turbines and oil pumpjacks, the flames have subsided. But the damage remains. The fire’s timing was especially cruel, coming in the midst of an extreme drought. Dead cows appear along roadsides, hooves pointed to the sky. Driveways lead to piles of rubble. When the wind blows, it smells a bit like a campfire. “You can see across the river and just see the black as far as you can see,” said Lori White, a Putnam, Okla., rancher who lost a calf and about a third of her pasture in the fire, and who has been helping coordinate hay deliveries for ranchers who fared worse. Last weekend, as a much-needed rainstorm tamped down the last of the flames, Matt Schaller delivered hay to ranchers around Vici. Mr. Schaller, who works on a grain farm, had driven more than 1,100 miles from Michigan with a load of donated bales, part of a nonprofit group he helped start last year after making deliveries during the Kansas fires. “It’s just what you do,” Mr. Schaller said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Pierre-Julien Gilbert's dramatic painting Combat de la Cordelière shows the ill-fated clash between the two ships The spirit of famed French explorer Jacques Cousteau lives on in a mission to find the wrecks of two warships, one French and one English, that sank 500 years ago off the Brittany port of Brest. Instead of Cousteau's old minesweeper Calypso, it is the French culture ministry's surveillance ship André Malraux and its doughty crew of scientists and divers. Today's adventure: to locate, excavate and eventually raise the wrecks of the Cordelière and the Regent - two behemoths of the Tudor seas that sank together in the Battle of Saint-Mathieu in 1512. And filling the Cousteau role is Michel L'Hour, marine archaeologist extraordinaire and veteran of a thousand missions to explore France's underwater heritage. ""I have been obsessed with finding these ships for 40 years,"" he says, ruddy-faced and bearded like any proper sea-dog. Image caption Seasoned marine archaeologist Michel L'Hour hopes to bow out once the ships are found ""I am not so young any more, and I think this may be my last mission. If I can locate the ships, then leave them to my colleagues to excavate, I will be a happy man."" How the two ships were sunk For the French, or rather for the people of Brittany, the Cordelière has mythic status. She was the flagship of the duchy's last independent ruler and revered heroine, the Duchess Anne. And she was captained up until the moment of sinking (and his death) by another Breton hero, Hervé de Portzmoguer, a kind of patriot-corsair. His Frenchified name Primauguet is still given to vessels of the French navy to this day. But the English have a hand in this tale too. Image caption The André Malraux's crew scour the ocean floor with remote-controlled vehicles The Regent was, in its day, every bit as important as its sister ship the Mary Rose, which was famously raised from the Solent 40 years ago and is now on display in Portsmouth. If anything, the Regent was the bigger ship. And if Henry VIII's Mary Rose is anything to go by, then this would be a stupendous find indeed. The trouble is no-one knows exactly where the Battle of Saint-Mathieu took place. It was during one of the lesser-known wars between England and an alliance of France and a still-independent Brittany. Image caption Hundreds died as the two ships caught fire and went down together On 10 August 1512, the Franco-Breton fleet was at anchor off Brest when it sighted the approaching English. Most of the French ships made haste to get to safety through the mouth of the inner bay of Brest, a passage known as the goulet. But the Cordelière and two other ships stayed to fight off the attack. The Regent bore down on the Cordelière and for two or three hours there was close-quarters fighting. But then, and no-one knows why, it all ended with a massive explosion. The two ships, entangled in battle, sank together to the bottom. Hundreds died. Out there, somewhere With backing from the French government, the Brittany region, universities and industry, Michel L'Hour has assembled a multidisciplinary team to find what he knows must be down there somewhere. Tides and currents have been recalculated. Previous efforts had failed to spot that the calendar changed in 1582. Naval charts of the sea floor have been re-examined. Historians are looking through the few contemporary accounts of the battle, and the search is on for clues from parish and other archives. Christophe Cerino, of Brittany-South University, says diplomatic records in the UK will be a particular focus. ""We know that several hundred Englishmen were on the Regent, and many were of noble families. After the battle their bodies will have washed up somewhere on the coast and been given burial,"" he says. Image caption Research is based on the scant records available and the team is searching for more ""Somewhere in the archives there are bound to be requests from noble families asking for the repatriation of these bodies. Those requests will contain names of places and parishes. ""Knowing where the bodies washed up, and the state of the currents, we may get a clearer picture where the battle took place."" Close, but no warship For now Mr L'Hour is working on the theory that the French fleet was anchored near the goulet on the southern side of the outer bay, near the village of Camaret-sur-Mer. This is based on a contemporary report that it was sheltering from a southerly wind, or auster. The battle, he thinks, must have taken place in waters to the north of Camaret. So that is where the André Malraux is now in a back-and-forth combing operation, dragging an array of sonar and magnetic detectors. An undersea robot sends back video, and divers are ready to explore any find. Image caption Video footage from the unmanned vehicles is pored over by the team back in the control room In the operations room, the Cousteau-esque motif holds truer than ever, as the faithful team in identical Cordelière T-shirts (many have been with Michel L'Hour for years) pore over the incoming video and puzzle over recovered pieces of ceramic. In fact, within the first days there has already been an interesting discovery. A wreck has been located that is in the right zone. It is big, and Mr L'Hour can tell from its clinker-built construction (with overlapping planks) that it is from the 15th or 16th Century. At one point it even looks like there might be two wrecks lying together, which would be a clincher. Image caption A fascinating discovery - but not the one the team was hunting for But, alas, doubts set in. If this is a warship, where are the cannon? There are apparently none, which means it is probably only a commercial ship. An important find, but not the one they were looking for. Michel L'Hour is convinced that with all the technology now available the wrecks of the Cordelière and the Regent will eventually be found. And afterwards who knows? The dream is of a museum in Brest. As for the Cousteau comparison, Mr L'Hour - who knew him - is bemused. ""You know that Cousteau was a hopeless archaeologist. At one of his excavations in the Mediterranean, he completely failed to spot that he was dealing with not one shipwreck but two, one lying on top of the other. ""It was because of the mess he made, that the ministry created our outfit - the first ever government-funded undersea archaeological survey ship. ""But the team, the camaraderie, the seamanship - that I would be proud to share.""

MIKE HALE,"But it maintains a tricky, entertaining balance between the violence and suspense of its conspiracy-minded mysteries and a continuous current of deadpan, fondly cynical wit. Season 2 made me chuckle more often than any other recent non-comedy. The key ingredient (beyond the writing, much of it by the playwright Matt Cameron, one of the show’s creators) is the casting of Guy Pearce as the diffident, depressed Irish, who, like any good Philip Marlowe clone, likes to be left alone but can’t keep quiet when he sees injustice. The pretty-boy pugnaciousness Mr. Pearce displayed in “L.A. Confidential” and “Memento” is on display here in a gentler form — he still leads with a pout and a thrust-out jaw, but now the effect is more rueful and self-deprecating than mean. And Mr. Pearce is supported by a crack cast that includes Marta Dusseldorp as Irish’s mostly off-again journalist girlfriend, Linda; Roy Billing as Harry, Irish’s bookie and occasional employer; and Aaron Pedersen as Harry’s enforcer and Irish’s reluctant sometime accomplice, Cam. Harry and Cam carry the second season’s primary subplot, a lighthearted but bone-cracking account of a squabble among racetrack rivals. Unlike other streaming-era shows that struggle to fill out their eight- or 10-episode runs, “Jack Irish” stuffs an extraordinary amount of plot into its half-dozen hours. Irish, with help from Linda, Cam and other regulars (including the endearingly acerbic hacker Simone, played by Kate Atkinson), unravels a byzantine case on several continents while helping out at the track and looking after a surly new acquaintance who threatens to become a surrogate daughter. Like a number of other current Australian series and films, the season’s mystery involves the treatment of immigrants, in this case the exploitation of students from around Asia who are lured to Australia by the promise of a more prestigious college degree than they could get at home.

RICK ROJAS,"He also said he prefers his cicadas cooked in salt and garlic. Some have compared the taste of a cicada to popcorn, bacon, even crab. The cicadas are often referred to as locusts, given the biblical proportions of their swarms, but they are not. The insects have black bodies, bulging rust-colored eyes, clear wings and legs that have been known to get stuck in teeth. Sandra Bigtree ate a cicada the last time they had emerged, and she did not particularly care for it. Her twin sons were 6 at the time, and she said they ate a dozen of them in one sitting. “We told them this was a meaningful experience,” said Ms. Bigtree, a founding board member of the Indigenous Values Initiative.

KIRK JOHNSON,"A sudden, fast-moving fire in Northern California forced a scramble of evacuations and road closings, burning at least 5,000 acres from a start early Thursday morning near Chico, about 100 miles north of Sacramento. The blaze was threatening the town of Paradise, population about 27,000, where a hospital was evacuated and gridlock had forced some people to flee vehicles on foot, according to a report on Wildfire Today, a website that covers fire news across the country. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said on its website that the fire, called Campfire, began near the town of Pulga, which is on the western edge of the Plumas National Forest. The Butte County sheriff tweeted that shelters had opened in Chico and Oroville. A red flag warning was issued by the state for a wide area of the county, as strong winds and low relative humidity were elevating fire conditions.","The blaze burned at least 5,000 acres from a start near Chico and was threatening the town of Paradise.",2018-11-08T20:17:42Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fast-Moving Fire in Northern California Forces Evacuations,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/california-fires-paradise-chico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/09/us/09fire/09fire-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1

But she could never get it right. It wasn’t until she was an adult that she learned Whitney wore a wig.

We are working on exploring a wider spectrum of diversity, socioeconomic and otherwise, and appreciate your comments and ideas for making the column more real, more helpful, better. In hearing from our How I Parent guests, I know that I’ve appreciated the honesty around the support people get. It’s something parents don’t talk about enough. I believe that being able to peek into the logistics of different families can help everyone make more informed choices and also understand that no one can do it alone. So I wanted to ask you, readers: How much help do you get as a parent? I’ll go: My daughter goes to kindergarten and an after-school program, which allows my husband and I to work full-time.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Enfoque Image caption A host of mobile phones were raised aloft to capture the moment Ricardo and Alberto were lit on fire Rumours of child abducto rs spread through WhatsApp in a small town in Mexico. The rumours were fake, but a mob burned two men to death before anyone checked. On August 29, a little after midday, Maura Cordero, the owner of an arts and crafts shop in the small town of Acatlán in the central Mexican state of Puebla, noticed an unusual number of people gathering outside the municipal police station next to her shop. Cordero, 75, moved closer to the door and peered out. Dozens of people were outside the police station on Reforma Street, the town's main thoroughfare, and the crowd was swelling. Soon there would be more than a hundred people. Cordero could not remember seeing such a crowd in Acatlán outside of a holiday celebration. As she watched a police car passed her shop bearing two men into the small jail house. The car was followed by more people and cries went up from the crowd accusing the two men who were taken into the jail house of being child abductors. From behind a narrow metal gate at the entrance to the station, police replied that the men were not child abductors but minor offenders. They were minor offenders, the officers said again and again, as the crowd grew in size. Inside the station sat 21-year-old Ricardo Flores, who had grown up just outside Acatlán but moved to Xalapa, 250km to the north east, to study law, and his uncle Alberto Flores, a 43-year-old farmer who had lived for decades in a small community just outside Acatlán. Ricardo had recently returned to Acatlán to visit relatives, who said the two men went to the centre of town that day to buy construction supplies to finish work on a concrete block water well. Police said there was no evidence the men had committed any crime, and that they had been taken into the station for ""disturbing the peace"" after they were accosted by local residents. But the mob outside the station on Reforma Street was in the grip of a different version of events, a story stirred up somewhere unknown and spread through the private messaging app WhatsApp. ""Please everyone be alert because a plague of child kidnappers has entered the country,"" said the message that pinged from phone to phone. ""It appears that these criminals are involved in organ trafficking...In the past few days, children aged four, eight and 14 have disappeared and some of these kids have been found dead with signs that their organs were removed. Their abdomens had been cut open and were empty."" Sighted near an elementary school in a nearby community called San Vicente Boqueron, Ricardo and Alberto became the child abductors conjured up by collective fear, and news of their arrest spread just as the rumours of the child abductors had. The crowd that descended on the police station was whipped up in part by Francisco Martinez, a long-time resident of Acatlán known as ""El Tecuanito"". According to police, Martinez was among those who spread messages on Facebook and Whatsapp accusing Ricardo and Alberto. Outside the police station, he began to livestream events on Facebook via his phone. ""People of Acatlán de Osorio, Puebla, please come give your support, give your support,"" he said into the camera. ""Believe me, the kidnappers are now here."" As Martinez attempted to rally the town, another man, identified by the police only as Manuel, climbed up onto the roof of the colonial-style town hall building next to the police station, and rang the bells of the government office to alert locals that the police were planning to release Ricardo and Alberto. A third man, Petronilo Castelan ""El Paisa"" used a loudspeaker to call on the citizens to contribute money to buy petrol to set the two men on fire, and he walked through the crowd to collect it. Image copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Life carries on in Acatlán, at the spot where Ricardo and Alberto Flores burned to death In her shop, Maura Cordero watched with fright, until she heard from a someone outside that they should run because the crowd would set the men on fire. Dear God, she thought, this is not possible. Moments later, the crowd coalesced into a mob with one goal. The narrow gate at the entrance to the police station was wrenched open and Ricardo and Alberto Flores were dragged out. As people held their phones aloft to film, the men were pushed to the floor at the base of four stone steps and savagely beaten. Then the petrol that was brought earlier was poured on them. Eyewitnesses believe Ricardo was already dead from the beating, but his uncle Alberto was still alive when they set the two men on fire. Video footage shows his limbs moving slowly as the flames licked around them. The blackened bodies remained on the ground for two hours after they were burned, while state prosecutors made their way from Puebla City to Acatlán, and the reek of the petrol remained in the air. Petra Elia Garcia, Ricardo's grandmother, was called to the scene to identify the men, and she said tears were still on Alberto's cheeks when she arrived. ""Look what you did to them!"" she shouted at the remnants of the mob, which had begun to disperse. ""It was one of the most horrific things that ever happened in Acatlán,"" said Carlos Fuentes, a driver who works from a taxi stand near the police station. ""The columns of smoke could be seen from every point in the town."" Image copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Ricardo Flores' father, Jose Guadalupe, looks over his family's ranch in Acatlán The road that runs into Acatlán is lined on either side by maize and marigold fields. Mango, fig and walnut trees grow from vast plots of land owned by local farmers. The town is nestled in the heart of the Mixteca highlands and is known as the ""Pearl of the Mixteca region"" a reference to the Mixtecs Mesoamerican indigenous groups that first settled in the region centuries ago. Most families in Acatlán depend on remittances sent to them by relatives who have migrated to the United States. Like many other towns in Mexico, it has seen thousands of its citizens leave to head north in search of better opportunities. Among those migrants in the early 2000s were Maria del Rosario Rodriguez and Jose Guadalupe Flores, who moved north in the hope of providing better living conditions for their two young sons left behind, Jose Guadalupe Jr and his younger brother Ricardo. The two boys, aged seven and three, stayed behind with their grandmother, Petra Elia Garcia, in Xalapa in the state of Veracruz. Their parents, Maria and Jose Guadalupe, moved from city to city in the US before making their home in the east coast city of Baltimore. Maria became a domestic worker and Jose Guadalupe a construction worker, and they had a third child and called her Kimberley. Via Facebook and Facetime, they kept in constant communication with their two sons at home. Image copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Few people in Acatlán would talk about the violence that day Image copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Maria with baby Ricardo at the family home in Acatlán Then on 29 August, Maria received a string of Facebook messages which seemed at first like a bad dream. A close friend in Acatlán was telling her that her son Ricardo had been arrested and was suspected of child abductions. It was a mistake, she thought. Ricardo would never be involved with such a thing. But the messages kept coming. Then came a link to a livestream on Facebook, and when she clicked on it she saw a mob, then she saw her son and his brother in law being beaten by the mob. In vain, she posted a comment on the livestream. ""Please don't hurt them, don't kill them, they're not child kidnappers,"" she recalled writing. But her message had no effect and she watched in horror as the men were doused in petrol, and the same technology that allowed a man in Acatlán to summon a mob to kill her son allowed her to watch him die. Later that day, Maria, Jose Guadalupe, and Kimberley returned to Acatlán for the first time in more than a decade. There they met Jazmin Sanchez, Alberto's widow, who had also watched the events unfold on Facebook. For decades Jazmin and Alberto had lived just 14km outside Acatlán, in Xayacatlan de Bravo. Every day, Alberto went to work in the Maize fields he had planted on the land he owned in nearby Tianguistengo. When he died he left behind a small, half-built house in Tianguistengo, as well as the wife and three daughters he was building it for. ""He was a good man, he didn't deserve to die the way he did,"" said Jazmin, clutching a cap, a belt, and a wallet that had belonged to her late husband. Maria and Jose Guadalupe returned to another small house in Tianguistengo which they had left for their sons when they set out for the US. Standing at the back of the house, Maria recalled her son. He liked butterflies and running through the maize fields around the house. He left to study law because he wanted to defend people from injustices. ""They took him from us and he didn't even leave a child behind for us to take care of,"" she said.

With the exception of Maura Cordero, the shop owners on Reforma Street said they were out of town when the violence happened, or that they shut their shops and fled, or that they never opened in the first place that day, which was not a holiday. ""No one wants to talk about it,"" said Fuentes, the taxi driver. ""And the people who were directly involved are already gone."" According to state authorities, five people have now been charged with instigating the crime and four more with carrying out the murder. Martinez, who broadcast the livestream, Castelan, who called for petrol, and the man identified as Manuel, who rang the bells, were among the five. But the remaining two alleged instigators, and the four suspects charged with the murder were on the run, police said. The day after Ricardo and Alberto died, a funeral service was held in Acatlán. Maria believed there were eyewitnesses to the crime among the crowd who gathered at the service. ""Look how you killed them! You all have children! And I want justice for my loved ones!"" she shouted as tears rolled down her cheeks and the cameras from the local and national TV stations filmed. Now the family lives in fear in Acatlán, Maria said. They are afraid to go to the market. ""I lost my grandson who was like my son,"" said Ricardo's grandmother. ""They accused them of being criminals, with no proof."" Maria still cannot understand why the mob was swept up in the lie. ""Why didn't they check? No children were kidnapped, no one filed a formal complaint. It was fake news,"" she said.

Rumours and fake news stories on Facebook and WhatsApp have fomented fatal violence in India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, to name just three. In India, as in Mexico, the technology WhatsApp is an encrypted private messaging app that lets people send messages to large groups has upgraded time-old rumours about child abductors for the 21st Century, allowing them to spread faster and farther with less accountability. WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, has been linked to a wave of lynchings across India, often fuelled by fake stories of child abductors. In the state of Assam in June, in an incident frighteningly similar to that in Acatlán, Abhijit Nath and Nilotpal Das were beaten to death by a mob of 200. Both WhatsApp and Facebook are widely used for news consumption in Mexico, according to a 2018 report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. According to the same report, 63% of internet users in Mexico say they are either very concerned or extremely concerned about the spread of fake news. ""The digital platforms serve as instantaneous vehicles to channel the best and the worst of us, including our fears and prejudices,"" said Manuel Guerrero, the director of the School of Communication at Mexico's Universidad Iberoamericana. ""And that becomes more evident in the absence of effective authorities that can guarantee our safety,"" he said. Image copyright Brett Gundlock Image caption Maria del Rosario Rodriguez, holds her son's phone. She can not bear to look at the fake rumours which led to his death On 30 August, the day after Ricardo and Alberto died in Acatlán, residents of the town of San Martin Tilcajete in the southern state of Oaxaca attempted to lynch a group of seven men, a group of housepainters, who were falsely accused of being child kidnappers. That day, police officers were able to rescue the men. The day after that, the grisly scene from Acatlán repeated itself in Tula in central Hidalgo state, where two innocent men were accused of being child abductors, beaten, and burned to death. Beyond Mexico, in Ecuador, on 16 October, two men and a woman arrested for allegedly stealing 200 US dollars were killed by a mob after a message circulated on WhatsApp falsely accusing them of being child snatchers. And on 26 October, a mob in Colombia's capital Bogota killed a man who was falsely accused in WhatsApp messages of being linked to the kidnapping of a child. Because of WhatsApp's ironclad end-to-end encryption, the origin of anything shared on the app is impossible to trace. The company resisted calls in July from the Indian government to break its encryption and allow authorities to track messages. Image caption Jose Gil, the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City, oversees his team WhatsApp has taken steps to try and stem the tide, adding a label to messages that have been forwarded and limiting the number of groups messages can be forwarded to 20 worldwide and to five in India. ""We believe the challenge of mob violence requires action from technology companies, civil society, and governments,"" the company told the BBC. ""We've stepped up user education about misinformation and provided training for law enforcement on how to use WhatsApp as a resource in their community."" A spokesman for Facebook told the BBC the platform ""did not want our services to be used to incite violence"". ""Earlier this year we identified and removed videos showing mob violence in the Mexican state of Puebla, and we have updated our policies to remove content that could lead to real-world harm,"" the spokesman said. ""We will continue to work with tech companies, civil society, and governments to fight the spread of content that has the potential to cause harm."" At least 10 state governments in Mexico, including Puebla's, have now launched information campaigns alerting citizens to the wave of fake social media messages about child abductions, and Mexico City's cyber police have created chat groups on Whatsapp to allow direct communication with residents of at least 300 neighbourhoods across the capital. Citizens ask the police via the groups to verify stories and police use the groups in turn to gather evidence against those who spread fake news. Also on the team's remit: identity theft, extortion attempts, and human trafficking. ""We believe that of every 10 crimes, technology is used in nine,"" said Jose Gil the deputy minister for Information and Cyber Intelligence in Mexico City. ""Social media can really alter a community through the spread of false information that many of us perceive as truthful, because it's being sent by people we trust,"" he said. ""Society really needs to evaluate what is true and what is false, and decide what is trustworthy and what is not."" A lack of effective law enforcement and culture of impunity in Mexico made rumours inciting violence ""pure dynamite"", said Tatiana Clouthier, a member of parliament in the country's Chamber of Deputies. The lynchings in Acatlán had weighed privacy and freedom of expression against a terrible cost, she said. ""But to what do we give priority? We have to give priority to freedom of expression, but where is the limit? And that's a topic that none of us want to get into because nobody wants to curtail freedom of expression, but we cannot allow disinformation. The situation we are facing is very dangerous."" Image copyright Brett Gundlock On 24 October in the afternoon, a group of around 30 relatives of Ricardo and Alberto gathered under the sun at the Church of the Calvary in Acatlán for a memorial service. The priest prayed for both families and blessed two metallic crosses that they had brought. The service lasted for an hour, and then the families walked half a kilometre carrying the crosses to the place they had avoided for the past two months. Ricardo's father, Jose Guadalupe, placed the crosses by the stone steps where Ricardo and Alberto died, and the group stood for a while in silence on a quiet afternoon on the main street in town. ""It was very painful to be in the same place that the bodies were left charred,"" Ricardo's mother Maria said later. ""All of this happened because of rumours and because people were carried away by those rumours."" Those rumours still exist on Maria's phone - and perhaps on other phones all across the town and beyond but she cannot bear to look at them now or show them to anyone else. The day of the memorial, she made a pledge with Alberto's widow Jazmin to visit the site of the lynching once a week and replenish the votive candles they had left by the crosses. ""The crosses should remain there forever,"" she said, ""so the people of Acatlán may see and remember what they did.""

Until this week, just two American service members had been killed in Syria.
Allied aircraft bombed a mosque on Thursday that the Islamic State had used as a command center in Safafiyah, Syria, in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, the Pentagon said. It was unclear if the airstrike was in response to the attack in Manbij, scores of miles to the northwest, or, more likely, a target of opportunity.
Manbij was still in shock on Thursday, residents said, struggling to deal with the aftermath of the bombing and their towns uncertain future should Mr. Trump make good on his promise to withdraw American troops. Turkey has talked about invading. The Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies want the territory back. And the Islamic State has proved it still has the ability to strike.
The attack added fuel to the debate over the ever-shifting American mission in eastern Syria, and President Trumps plans to bring troops home.
While Mr. Trump and, as recently as Wednesday, Vice Mike President Pence, insisted that the Islamic State had been defeated, a range of American officials, including many of Mr. Trumps allies, have said the attack proved otherwise and that leaving Syria could allow the jihadists to come roaring back.
Mr. Darwish, of the local military council, said that whether the United States ultimately withdraws or not, the existing confusion over American policy had emboldened the jihadists.
ISIS benefits from the tense atmosphere, the murky situation, the recent statements, the decision to withdraw and the tweets from all over, he said.

Back Story Jerry Garcia once said the Grateful Dead was like licorice : “Not everybody likes licorice, but the people who like licorice really like licorice.” The Grateful Dead broke up on this day in 1995, four months after the guitarist and vocalist’s death, and after playing more than 2,300 concerts over 30 years.

Credit Associated Press Even Mr. Garcia may have underestimated how long die-hard love for the band would last — or how it would evolve, as seen in a trip through the Times archives. In a 1973 article, “ The Grateful Dead Makes a Real Good Hamburger,” our reporter called the band “experts in the art and science of showing people another world.” Another Times writer liked the band’s “feathery locomotive groove.” Our coverage wasn’t always approving: In “ Just What the Tie-Dyed Crowd Wanted,” from 1989, we noted that “Grateful Dead shows are as iffy as blind dates,” and this year we referred to the band’s history as a “ 30-year hippie-pirate soap opera.” More recently, the Dead have been praised as music business pioneers. They favored the now common formula of prioritizing touring over selling records, and were first to encourage fans to make and trade concert recordings. In 2015, the remaining members reunited for “Fare Thee Well” shows. The average ticket price for some of them was $938.

RICHARD FAUSSET,"The church, which was founded in the 19th century, had undergone extensive remodeling two years ago. Now it is nearly gone, he said, except for a brick wall and corridor in the front.
Im trying to find out who did it, why they did it, did it have anything to do with me, said Mr. Toussaint, who drives trucks for a living. I dont know none of this.
He also said he did not want to speculate, for fear of angering potential arsonists, or prompting copycat crimes.
St. Landry Parish is a rural area studded with crawfish ponds and bayous in the heart of Cajun and Creole country. It is 56 percent white and 41 percent black. Mr. Toussaint said that relations were generally good between black and white residents.
Since the 1950s, black churches across the South have been the targets of numerous racist attacks, from arson to bombing to armed assault. In 2015, a white supremacist shot and killed nine people at a Bible study at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C.
In 2006, a string of arsons at Alabama churches, some predominantly white, some predominantly black, proved to be the work of three college students that officials characterized as a joke that had spun out of control.
Last month, a black member of a predominantly black congregation, Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Miss., pleaded guilty to burning his church.

The Thomas fire has burned more than 1000sq km - an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined. The blaze broke out in Santa Paula in early December and has moved west towards the coast, one of several major fires in California in recent months. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to bring it under control. Most of California's largest wildfires have been recorded this century. Scientists say the warming climate and spread of buildings into wilderness areas have contributed. The Thomas fire slowly eclipsed previous record-setting blazes, finally overtaking the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres. It follows a series of deadly fires in the state's wine country in October that burned more than 10,000 homes and killed more than 40 people. The Thomas fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and claimed the life of one firefighter - Cory Iverson, a father of one from San Diego whose wife was expecting another child. The blaze is now moving slower because of rain and less wind.

Controlled burns by firefighters may cause some temporary expansion, it said. Seven of California's 10 largest fires on record have occurred since 2000. Two were in the 1970s and the earliest was in 1932 - the Matilija fire which, like the Thomas fire, burned through Ventura County.","The Thomas fire has now burned an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined.",2017-12-23T08:22:18Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California Thomas fire becomes largest in state's history,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42464835,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3272/production/_99141921_hi043472430.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,burned,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out. The Ranch Fire can now officially take its place in the record books, having burned a grand total of 459, 123 acres. The Ranch Fire was part of the Mendocino Complex, which lit up on July 27. Paired with the River Fire, the complex became the largest fire in state history in early August. Just a week later Ranch Fire took the title of the largest single fire in California history, fanned by powerful winds over a hot, dry landscape. The Ranch Fire continued its smoldering march through Mendocino National Forest just northeast of Ukiah until it was officially declared out on Wednesday. Crews are doing mop up work, helping clean up fire lines dug to contain the fire and searching for any last hot spots. While the blaze is out, the California’s state fire agency warned plumes of smoke could still rise due to the warm, dry weather. As crews continue assessing the landscape, a large closure remains in effect for the forest, including the Snowy Mountain Wilderness Area. The Ranch Fire was one of a few notable fires in California this summer. The Carr Fire left a swath of destruction in Redding and spawned a firenado while the Ferguson Fire shut down parts of Yosemite National Park. And we may not be done yet. Southern California’s fall fire season is just getting started. The Santa Ana winds that usher hot, dry air into the region helped fan last year’s Thomas Fire, which held California’s largest fire crown for all of eight months. The winds are calm for now, but they may not stay that way. “So after the present reprieve, I would not be surprised to see a renewed surge in heat, wind, and fire activity before the winter rains arrive,” UCLA climate scientist and California weather watcher Daniel Swain wrote on his blog this week. “I’ll keep my fingers crossed that we get a break this year, though. It’s already been a rough few years as far as California wildfires go.” All fires now occur in the context of a warming climate. This was California’s second-hottest summer on record, which no doubt helped the Ranch Fire take the title of California’s largest fire yet. Hotter conditions melt out snowpack earlier and dry out vegetation, creating a landscape more prone to explosive conflagrations. Research has shown that climate change has essentially doubled the area burned in western forests since the 1984. It’s enough to make one wonder if we should keep building in these places.","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out.

The 16-year-old girl died after being soaked in fuel and set on fire at her home in the Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh. Police said she was killed after telling her attacker she would inform her family about the rape. Two other similar attacks, one fatal, took place in Jharkhand this week. A 17-year-old girl remains in critical condition after being set on fire by a suspect who allegedly said he wanted to marry the victim, but had been rejected. The earlier case involved a 16-year-old who was burned alive after her parents complained to village elders about her rape. The accused had been ordered to do sit-ups and pay a fine as punishment, prompting them to beat the girl's parents and kill her. In the most recent attack, the victim was at home alone in Jujharpur village when she was attacked. Police said they had arrested a suspect, named as 28-year-old Ravi Chadhar. India is facing renewed public outrage over the number of violent sexual assaults in the country. BBC India correspondent Soutik Biswas recently wrote that ""rape is increasingly used as an instrument to assert power and intimidate the powerless in India"".

Eight Hindu men were arrested, and there was an outcry when two ministers from the Hindu BJP party attended a rally in support of the accused. In April, Hindu right-wing groups staged protests over the arrests. Another BJP politician has also been accused of raping a 16-year-old girl - a charge he denies.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Wikimedia Commons Image caption The fire burned for nearly three months in Oregon A judge has ordered a teenager to pay more than $36m (£27m) after he admitted starting a huge forest fire that raged for months in the US state of Oregon. Hood River County Judge John Olson ruled the boy must also write apology notes to 152 people who were trapped on hiking trails by the conflagration. The Eagle Creek fire burned for nearly three months in the scenic Columbia River Gorge, destroying several homes. A lawyer for the 15-year-old called the amount ""absurd"" and ""absolutely silly"". In February, the boy - who is not named in court documents - admitted to throwing a firework on 2 September 2017 into the tinder-dry Eagle Creek Canyon - about 50 miles (80km) from Portland. The resulting inferno engulfed 48,000 acres and cost fire crews $18m to fight. Image copyright CBS He pleaded guilty to eight counts of reckless burning of public and private property, two counts of depositing burning materials on forest land, as well criminal mischief and reckless endangerment of others. In a ruling on Monday, the court said the boy must pay $36,618,330 to Eagle Creek victims, including the US Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Transportation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission, a homeowner and others. He was also ordered to serve five years of probation and perform 1,920 hours of community service for the US Forest Service. The court acknowledged in its ruling that the teen will not be able to pay the full amount. Image copyright Wikimedia Commons But Judge Olson cited ""safety valves"" in state law that allows juvenile offenders to stop payments after 10 years if they finish probation and do not commit any other crimes. Jack Morris, a lawyer for the boy, argued last week that the penalty is excessive and urged the judge to impose a ""reasonable and rational"" amount, reports the Oregonian. But Judge Olson wrote that the figure ""is clearly proportionate to the offence because it does not exceed the financial damages caused by the youth"". He also directed the juvenile probation officers to help the boy create a payment schedule. The teen's mother told the Oregonian newspaper in November that the fire was ""a trauma"" for her son. During his plea hearing in February he begged the court's forgiveness, saying: ""I know I will have to live with his bad decision for the rest of my life, but I have learned from this experience and will work hard to help rebuild the community in any way that I can.

MATT STEVENS,"The first explosive fire of the season roared across Northern California on Monday, scorching thousands of acres, razing several homes and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. Named the Pawnee Fire, the blaze was so destructive that Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency as it continued to carve a path of devastation through Lake County — about 100 miles northwest of Sacramento — not yet contained after two days of burning. By Monday afternoon, officials said, the inferno had charred more than 8,000 acres of mostly rural and sparsely populated land, destroying at least 22 buildings, threatening an additional 600, and forcing as many as 1,500 residents to scoop up their treasured belongings and seek safer shelter.

Corey Paulich, a spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, said he believed about half of the destroyed structures were homes; the others were sheds, barns, garages and other outbuildings, he said.","The blaze, known as the Pawnee Fire, has burned thousands of acres in Lake County, destroying more than 20 structures and forcing hundreds of evacuations.",2018-06-26T02:05:02Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fire Carves Path of Destruction Through Northern California,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/pawnee-fire-california.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/26/us/26fire_xp/merlin_140199807_dffaca7a-4313-4259-84bd-2211b627987a-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1
TIM ARANGO,"When you are driving through these streets and through these neighborhoods, its kind of Armageddon-like, said Jed Teter, a firefighter with the Los Angeles Fire Department who served in Iraq in 2008 with the Marine Corps Reserves. Same thing in Ramadi. All the trash, all the disarray. At night, when the fires were raging and he was racing to try to spot them, Mr. Spangle was brought back to patrols in Afghanistan. The first night I was out here looking at hot spots, and just how strange the terrain became, being in total darkness without electricity, the experience reminded him of Afghanistan, he said. He was crossing a gully, and the ash made everything look as though it were covered in snow. He came across the burned-out remnants of cars, a fixture of the landscape of war in the Middle East, where any car on the road is a possible weapon packed with explosives. The environments of war and wildfires share a terrifying mixture of randomness and precision. A single ember kicked up by the winds a mile away can land on a house, torching it to the ground, while surrounding homes are left unscathed. Some saw a parallel with the precision-guided bombs delivered by American warplanes, which can take out a single sniper on a roof and not the buildings on either side. But often there is a sense that luck or the grace of God, as one Malibu resident put it Sunday when asked why his house survived while his neighbors homes did not is what explains survival. Travis Wilkerson was a Marine who fought in Iraq in 2007 during the troop surge in Falluja, and also in Afghanistan. For the last five years, he has worked for the Forest Service, and currently serves on a helicopter crew battling fires in remote forests distant from cities and towns. When you walk through an area that has been nuked out, you cant help but go back to the memories of war, he said. The briefings he sits through before going out to fight a fire are peppered with military expressions: aerial assaults, nighttime assaults, a coordinated assault with multiple units. When he sees airplanes circling overhead, as they did near the slopes of Malibu Canyon on Saturday, dropping retardant to slow the fires, he thinks of war.","Streets in Paradise, Calif., were cluttered with fallen utility poles and the burned-out hulks of abandoned cars as a fast-moving wildfire ravaged the town.",2018-11-13T10:00:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Burned-Out Cars, Smoke in the Air, Aerial Assaults, All in California",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/california-wildfires-war.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/12/business/00warfire-01/00warfire-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1
NICHOLAS CASEY,"CÚCUTA, Colombia Border standoffs may not get much stranger than this one.
Three presidents, a military plane and a lineup of pop artists brought by a British billionaire arrived at a border city known to few before it became famous as the site of a military blockade by Venezuelas defiant president, Nicolás Maduro.
Mr. Maduro was determined to keep foreign aid out of his country, and the Venezuelan opposition saw an opportunity. Their plan: to break the blockade on Saturday, a culminating act of defiance meant to force the military to choose between allowing food into a hungry nation and loyalty to Mr. Maduro.
It did not go well. By the end of the day, the military had largely sided with the regime, and a protest planned as peaceful had descended into violent skirmishes. Some of the desperately needed aid was burned at the border, and four people were reported dead.
It was Mr. Maduro who had made the first move.
Earlier this month, as food donated largely by the United States made its way to the Colombian border town of Cúcuta, his government barricaded an already-closed border bridge between Colombia and Venezuela, using tanker trucks and containers.","BURNED OFFERINGS Venezuelan officials blocked the border with Colombia in a bid to keep out humanitarian supplies.

MIKE IVES,"In 1994, Jeff Bezos considered many potential names before choosing Amazon, referencing one of the worlds longest rivers. Now, 24 years later, his bookseller has expanded into one of the worlds largest retailers, and its splitting its second headquarters between a Washington suburb and a New York neighborhood. Would it have been as successful had Mr. Bezos stuck with Cadabra ? He liked the echo of magic but people tended to hear it as cadaver. He hasnt ever fully given up on Relentless.com, which still forwards to Amazon. (The companys naming is recounted in The Everything Store, by Brad Stone, and was confirmed by Allison Flicker, an Amazon spokeswoman.) Worth noting: Amazons corporate arrival in New York City, confirmed this week, is something of a homecoming for Mr. Bezos, who was working at a New York hedge fund when the idea for Amazon was born.

SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Burn care is an intricate and multistep process. Doctors must not only heal the wounds with skin grafts and surgeries, but keep the body in balance as it recovers. From the moment burn victims arrive at the hospital they are hooked up to intravenous fluids. That is because the immune system responds to charred skin as a foreign invader like its a splinter, Dr. Greenhalgh said. The surge of inflammation puts the rest of the body at risk of dehydration, in a sense, from the inside out. Skin from Mr. Blevinss hip was grafted onto his hands. For some with large burns, artificial or donor skin, which the hospital keeps frozen in a bank, must be used as a temporary patch until the body can grow enough skin of its own for the graft. Throughout recovery, patients are frequently connected to feeding tubes for a period because their metabolism kicks into high gear: Even lying in hospital beds, patients burn calories about 1.5 times as fast, according to Dr. Greenhalgh, as the body goes into overdrive trying to repair itself. Mr. Blevins was released on Nov. 15, but returned Nov. 29 after infection set in, forcing amputation. Stroking Mr. Blevinss hair as he lay on the bed in their home, his swaddled hands propped on pillows, Ms. Sykes described how he had saved her from a life of methamphetamine addiction, bringing her from Yakima, Wash., to California about five years ago for a cleaner life. Both are recovering addicts, replacing drugs with the joy of motorcycling side by side. Now they fear that the narcotics Mr. Blevins has been prescribed for pain could send them spiraling. The last thing I want to do is come in as a burn patient, and leave as a heroin addict, Mr. Blevins said. Mr. Blevinss jobs as an alarm technician and a home health care provider took the couple from living in a car in 2014, to the little creeper-covered home they share with five cats and three dogs in Los Molinos, about 45 minutes drive northwest from Paradise. They now fear they will lose it. Unlike residents of the fire site, they are ineligible for much of the federal and state aid pouring into the area, because their house did not burn down. Then there are the nightmares. Days revolve around mitigating Mr. Blevinss anxiety a scented candle his fiancée lit set off a panic attack, he said and his twice-daily bandage changes. It is a painstaking process that takes nearly three hours as Ms. Sykes cuts away gauze, removes dead tissue and rebandages each finger. A few days before his amputation surgery, Mr. Blevins said that in some ways, he felt blessed. News reports of his condition led to a reunion with estranged family members, he said, and his bond with Ms. Sykes has deepened. Others, he knows, have lost far more. I pray to God that the families that have lost will heal, Mr. Blevins said. The same way I have got to heal physically, they have to heal emotionally.","Bill Blevins with his fiancée, Mary Sykes, at the U.C.

Josh Constine,"Airware desperately sought cash for 18 months before running out of money and shutting down last month, leaving about 120 employees without jobs after the startup had burned $118 million in funding. Bandaid strategic investments from construction company Caterpillar and others kept Airware alive as it looked for a $15 million round, according to a former employee. A late pivot from hardware to drone software sales through Caterpillar’s dealers went sour, as Airware lacked the features found in competitors and suffered from slow engineering cycles. “So Caterpillar told them, ‘We’re not going to fund you any more. We’re pulling our money.’ So Airware didn’t make payroll,” the source says. The sudden shutdown of one of the most-funded drone startups sent a shock wave through the industry. Luckily, at least part of Airware’s team is being rescued from the wreckage. French drone services company Delair is buying Airware’s Redbird analytics software and IP, plus the 26 employees who ran it. Airware had acquired Redbird and its 38-member team in 2016 to integrate its analytics that derived business metrics from 2D maps and 3D models of work sites based on imagery shot by drones. Now the Redbird team will do that for Delair, bringing along its relationships with 30 drone dealers and 200 customers to try to make sense of aerial imagery from construction sites, mines, energy infrastructure and more. “We managed to keep that business alive with Delair,” says Redbird CEO Emmanuel de Maistre. “Customers wanted us to keep this going. They were very worried to not have a solution anymore.” He says that Airware still isn’t formally in bankruptcy or administration, and that as it’s been “actively reaching out to players in the market, to sell the assets... Interest from software companies and hardware companies was quite high.” Founded in 2011, Delair now has 180 employees selling its UX11 mapping drone, data processing software and enterprise integration services to get businesses properly equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles. Delair had previously raised $28.5 million, and last month added a strategic Series B of undisclosed size from Intel — also an Airware investor. Delair co-founder Benjamin Benharrosh tells me that while his company started in hardware and bought Trimble’s UAV business Gatewing in 2016, “lots of the growth now is dedicated to the software,” so the Redbird buy makes sense. Meanwhile, Airware’s hardware assets are going to auction on Wednesday. Heritage Global Partners will be selling dozens of DJI drones plus networking equipment and computers. Terms of the Delair deal weren’t disclosed, but the money from that sale and the auction could help Airware pay off any outstanding debts or commitments. However, Airware’s A-List investors, including Y Combinator, Google’s GV, Andreessen Horowitz, First Round, Shasta, Felicis, Kleiner Perkins and Intel, aren’t likely to recoup much of their capital. We’ve reached out to Airware, its founding CEO Jonathan Downey and its final CEO Yvonne Wassenaar for comment and will update if we hear back. Founded in 2011, Airware tried to build a drone operating system before moving to sell drone hardware to commercial enterprises. But the rapid ascent of Chinese drone maker DJI pushed Airware to pivot out of hardware sales and toward drone data collection and analysis services. But a source says that since the startup entered this market late after the hardware boondoggle, “Airware’s technology was pretty far behind. They didn’t have a lot of the feature set a lot of others in the space did, like Propeller, 3DR and DroneDeploy.” Airware lacked seamless data uploads and quick processing times. “What happened in the company wasn’t so much that the management team didn’t manage it correctly. The sales team just couldn’t sell a product that didn’t work as easily as it needed to compared to other products in the market,” our source says. They noted that Wassenaar, who’d replaced Downey as CEO in June 2017, had done a good job and been dedicated to fundraising to save the company since she joined. “Ultimately it was a matter of bad timing, and they didn’t have the engineering to overcome bad timing,” our source says. “The issue Airware had was a lack of funding. They ran out of runway,” confirms Redbird’s de Maistre. Airware’s story should serve as a warning to startups raising at high-flying valuations. If a pivot doesn’t go smoothly or new competitors emerge, investors may disappear rather than back a down-round that might save the company but leave it in a downward spiral. Once a startup loses momentum, even having top investors and a ripe potential market can’t always stop it from disappearing into the sunset.","Airware desperately sought cash for 18 months before running out of money and shutting down last month, leaving about 120 employees without jobs after the startup had burned $118 million in funding.

SARAH MERVOSH,"A sixth person has died in the Carr Fire in Northern California, the authorities said on Sunday, as officials hinted they could be nearing a turning point in fighting the vast and erratic wildfire that has been burning for nearly a week. Tom Bosenko, the Shasta County sheriff, said at a news conference on Sunday that the latest victim was found after the fire consumed their home. He did not identify the person or say where in the region the person was found. Seven people were still reported missing, he said. The fire has claimed six lives since it began on July 23. Melody Bledsoe of Redding, Calif., and her great-grandchildren, James Roberts, 5, and Emily Roberts, 4, died after the fire engulfed Ms. Bledsoe’s home, a family representative said.

Tom McKay,"Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday. According to the report, Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden brought up the throttling in an addendum to a multi-state legal brief seeking the overturn of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission’s decision to throw out Barack Obama-era net neutrality rules. Bowden alleged that Verizon had throttled a SIM card connecting a fire department mobile command vehicle named “OES 5262” to 1/200th of its normal speed, putting lives and property at risk, and that the company’s support team refused to lift the restrictions until fire officials purchased a new data plan at “more than twice the cost.” Ars Technica wrote: “County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,” Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. “This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” Bowden’s declaration was submitted in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules in a lawsuit they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. According to Bowden, County Fire IT staff verified the connection was being throttled, which “severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively.” When those staff reached out and said the throttling was impacting public safety, Verizon customer support personnel confirmed they had deliberately limited OES 5262's connection, but that it would only be restored if County Fire switched to a more expensive plan and contacted the billing department. As a result, fire personnel were forced to use other departments’ service providers as well as their personal devices until County Fire paid up. Bowden wrote those personnel were deployed to help fight the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in the state. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fire is extremely hazardous to the nearly 3,500 firefighters currently fighting it, with Draper City, Utah fire department Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett dying this month while trying to help contain the blaze. In general, the blazes across the state have increasingly exhibited extreme behavior like immense fire tornadoes. Adding a service provider dispute to this situation is indisputably not helpful. Bowden further alleged that Verizon knew full well what it was doing and took advantage of the situation to “coerce” County Fire into paying more: While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. In a statement provided to Gizmodo as well as Ars Technica, a Verizon spokesperson wrote that the company “made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,” which was a “government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost.” The spokesperson wrote that while the plan offers “unlimited amount of data... speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle”—though they added that Verizon maintains “a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations” and the incident was a “customer support mistake.” Verizon also stated that the matter had “nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.” It’s true that throttling a plan that goes over its data limits isn’t a net neutrality issue per se. The Obama-era rules prohibited service providers from artificially slowing down or blocking content in a discriminatory fashion, whether it’s to limit their customers’ access to rival services or just charge extortionate fees to access certain services. But Bowden’s argument appears to be that County Fire’s experience with Verizon led him to believe they are quite willing to do just that to emergency personnel. “Please work with us,” a fire official wrote to Verizon on July 30th, according to documents filed with Bowden’s addendum. “All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.” [ Ars Technica ]","Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday.

Alex Cranz,"Youve sat too close to the TV. Or to the screen at the theater. Everything warps when you get up close. People become giants. The screen seems to go on forever. Everything takes on that 8-Bit video game look as you can see the sharp outline of each pixel. But have you ever sat too close to a computer monitor? Can you remember a time you put your nose to that screen and felt like it was too closetoo much? If you answer is no, might I interest you in the HP Omen X Emperium 65? Its 65 beautiful inches of display that HP thinks gamers will happily drop $5,000 for. It is at once far, far too much screen for a mere computer, and it is gluttonously just enough.
HP Omen X Emperium 65
What is it?
A VERY big gaming monitor
Like
The best display you can get for gaming at this price range.
No Like
Not a good enough TV for non-gamers.
The Emperium is the first of a new breed of too big computer monitors called Big Fucking Gaming Displays. No really. That is the name. BFGD for short. Nvidia announced a few of them back in January 2018, and then there was silence for a year. Now HP is the first partner to bring a BFGD to market. The appeal of the BFGD is, ostensibly, that I could get rid of the 65-inch OLED TV I use now and replace it with a 65-inch gaming monitor so I can finally get the big eye-popping display console gamers have had for years, but also something capable of actually handling the content my much more expensive computer churns out.
How does it game?
TVs and monitors handle content very differently. Besides HDR and 4K and 8K, the big buzz word in high-end displays right now is Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). A traditional display will refresh a few times a second. A 60Hz display 60 times a second, a 120Hz display 120 times a second, and so on. This isnt a problem when watching TV or movies, which have a specific refresh rate, but when playing games the number of frames supplied per second is dependent on the content. So a game might do 60 frames per second one moment and 90 fps the next. This can lead to screen tearing, where the game supplies frames faster than the monitor can refresh them. VRR lets things be more steady. A game capable of 60fps or higher will only supply 60 fps on a 60Hz display. No tearing.
The Empirium uses Nvidia G-Sync, a super smart kind of VRR in which the GPU and display talk to one each other, so they always know how to push out the optimal frame rate in any given moment. Its neat, but many people are just fine with less intelligent FreeSync and Adaptive Sync, which are cheaper VRR standards supported by AMD and Intel respectively. This monitor does not officially support those standards, so your results may vary if you are not using an Nvidia GPU.
Samsung makes TVs using FreeSync, which is supplied by Nvidias GPU rival, AMD. It works with some Xboxes via HDMI, which supports VRR. But HDMI VRR has limitations. It cant do G-Sync, at all. Theres not enough bandwidth in the cable. Nor can it do higher frames per second. Most TVs come with HDMI 1.4 ports which can only do 4K at a 30Hz refresh rate. HDMI 2.0a brings that up to 60Hz, but it doesnt support VRR. That requires HDMI 2.1 which youre only starting to see in TVs this year.
The Emperium might lack HDMI 2.1, but it has DisplayPort, which not only supports VRR, but specifically the more demanding G-Sync, as well as 4K at 120Hz. No TV can compare, and in my conversations with TV manufacturers, it doesnt appear that this is going to change any time soon (unless the Emperium and its ilk are huge successes that force TV makers to adopt this new technology). So if you want to PC game on a 65-inch display, the Emperium is the only option that makes sense.
How is it as a TV?
But is it good at what it does? Yes. When it comes to gaming, the Emperium presents a sharp picture, and I can play Battlefield 5 with a mouse and keyboard from six feet away, or sit up close with a controller and enjoy some Assassins Creed Odyssey and never find myself worrying about lag or unsightly pixels. Even using Windows 10 isnt terribly uncomfortablethough I dont think I ever needed to write a blog in Kinja on a 65-inch screen.
The day-glo colors Atomic Blonde pop, while the darker skin tones of the cast of Black Panther always look human, instead of orange. The TV is capable of HDR10, which is solidthough I would have preferred support for DolbyVision as well given the price. The system does have a little problem with blooming, or flashlighting, which is when bright objects near dark parts of the screen cause to the dark parts to illuminate too. You can see it as a faint bluish gray glow around the particles in the video below.
Its not the end of times. LED TVs all struggle with this problem, and HP has done a decent job with it, to the point that I dont even notice when Im sitting dead center and watching the display.
While the picture quality seems like fully baked perfection, other more TV-centric elements of the set feel like an afterthought. Take the built-in Nvidia Shield for example. This gives the Emperium smart TV functions thanks to the Shields support of Android apps and Chromecast. Yet it isnt the hub of the displays software. If I want to switch from the Shield to my Switch, I cant just choose the input like I might with a Roku or Amazon Fire TV. I have to leave whatever app Im in and turn on the Emperiums local UI from the Shields system settings. Its clumsy, and even just an input button on the included Shield remote would have made things better.
The local UI is also clumsy, just like every other high-end computer monitiors clunky options. Theres no fine tuning of the picture or audio. Thats okay if Im adjusting everything from my $1,000-plus PC, but not very helpful with my Switch.
How does it look?
But the biggest problem with the Emperium is the industrial design of the display itself. TVs the same size as the Emperium are all doing their damnedest to make the non-display elements disappear. Some go with a clear pedestal while others like slim reflective feet. Anything to make the display look like its floating. Not the Emperium. No, this is a gamers display okay?
So its got big honking feet that look like theyre inspired by Alien. There is no mistaking this thing for anything but a product for gamers. Have a tasteful mid-century modern aesthetic in your living room? TOO BAD. ONLY GAMER TOWN HERE. When you flip it on, a strip of LEDs on the back glow bright red, and the included soundbar rumbles, so you know you are here to PLAY.
This thing is so pointedly specific in its aesthetic that only a small subset of the population will find it attractive. So you can use it to find others like you. Do they smile politely when you invite them into your cramped bedroom and motion to the multiple paychecks wrapped up as a display? Or are they genuinely as delighted as you are?
But look, if you can afford a $5,000 65-inch monitor and the people you invite into your life are okay with that decision, and the look of the thing, then it doesnt matter what I think about it. What matters is, is it any better than a TV?
And for PC gaming, the Emperium is undoubtedly the best 65-inch display you can buy. But really it is ONLY if you want to PC game. If youre on Xbox or PlayStation, you will never ever appreciate what the Emperium can provide. It is a waste of your money and the displays impressive performance, and there are TVs with a similar picture quality that cost a whole lot less. But if you PC game, and youre okay with the look, AND you have $5,000 to spend on a monitor, then, I guess, your very small and expensive niche has been filled.

JENNIFER MEDINA and JACK HEALY,"After his mother fled, Mr. Sezzi, 51, returned to the home and tried to stave off destruction with a garden hose. He could see a glow behind the ridgeline above him, and as the winds kicked up, the hillsides erupted into quilts of fire. Flames skittered down the hills toward avocado orchards, neighboring streets — and him. “It was like someone had turned on a burner from a range,” Mr. Sezzi said. “The fire, the ash, the smoke — everything right toward me. It’s coming at me, getting in my eyes.” As the flames began to surround him, Mr. Sezzi decided his battle to save the house was lost, and he had to go. The fire destroyed the house. It burned so hot that it cracked the fireplace and melted a pan Mr. Sezzi’s mother used to make Christmas cakes into a “glob of molten metal.” Photo Paul and Steve Sezzi sorted through the remains of their mother’s home in Ventura on Wednesday.

Because where do we evacuate to?” Trish Valenteen said she had stood in her yard in Ventura and prayed for the fire to pass by the house she shares with her 84-year-old father. They were prepared to evacuate on Tuesday night, but ended up staying. She thought they were safe, but on Thursday morning, the Santa Ana winds carried a grimmer omen. “I’m listening to the wind start up again and realizing that we could be in for more destruction,” Ms. Valenteen said. In the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, Amanda Saviss, 26, woke up Wednesday and began packing as much as she could from her family’s home on Moraga Drive. Even before they saw firefighters down the hill from her home, the family knew they needed to get out. Photo A firefighter in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday. Credit Jae C. Hong/Associated Press “It was in the air everywhere,” Ms. Saviss said. “Ash, smoke, all of it. We took everything we could, our whole lives — clothes, pictures, jewelry.” When they realized they had forgotten to water down some dry bushes nearby, a firefighter allowed them to walk back quickly. None of their neighbors had dared to ignore the evacuation orders, she said. “That would be crazy.” They spent much of the morning at a cousin’s house, glued to the local news. By late afternoon, the family of five started to look for a comfortable place for them and their dog. They landed at Hotel Angeleno, an iconic cylindrical tower just west of the 405 freeway and opposite the burning Bel-Air neighborhood. They tried to find their home from the window of a high building but never managed to spot it. They were assured by reports that the flames never reached their street.

BEN ROTHENBERG,"With a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at 120 miles per hour, Marino surged to a high of 38th in the rankings in the summer of 2011, when she was 20. Not a highly touted junior prospect, she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis successes mounted, catapulting her faster and further than she was prepared to handle.
Not expecting it, I felt like I was thrown into this machine, and I didnt understand how it worked, she said.
Marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in 2012, taking seven months off. After returning for several months, she retired in February 2013 at age 22.
In a conference call announcing her decision, Marino revealed her struggles with depression; days earlier, she had discussed her social media abuse in an interview with The New York Times. Her leaving the sport was often attributed to one of those factors, or both of them, which Marino said was inaccurate in retrospect.
When I look back, I wouldnt necessarily say it was depression, she said of her decision to stop playing. It was burnout, and it was expectations put on my shoulders by myself and others, and I just wasnt able to cope. It kind of all came to a head in a big, giant burnout, I guess.","Burned out, struggling with depression and fed up with cyberbullying, Rebecca Marino quit tennis in 2013.

MJ Franklin,"Ray Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451 opens with one of the most iconic opening lines to grace modern literature: ""It was a pleasure to burn."" The novel, fiery from the start, explores a dystopian society where books are illegal. When a book is discovered, it's burned, its owner is arrested, and the house the shelters both book and owner is burned down. The people responsible for policing those books are called ""firemen,"" who are responsible for starting fires rather than putting them out. SEE ALSO: Michael B. Jordan is straight fire in the trailer for HBO's 'Fahrenheit 451' Fahrenheit 451 follows Guy Montag, a fireman who finds himself more and more curious about the literature he is destroying and the system that demands books be burned. Since it debuted in 1953, Fahrenheit 451 has become a classic, taught in schools all over the country. But does Ray Bradbury's dystopian tale withstand the test of time? Inspired by HBO's Michael B. Jordan-led remake of the Ray Bradbury classic, we decided to reread Fahrenheit 451 for the MashReads Podcast. Wow, that book does NOT age well. The book's anxiety of tech — the novel particularly admonishes the increasing prevalence of television — comes across as curmudgeonly and simplistic. Modern readers who have grown up with tech, surprise, have not been reduced to TV-obsessed zombies. (Though many, many of the same fears of television have been leveraged against smartphones and social media.) ""In its simplistic nature of telling how important books are, [the book] also simplifies television and entertainment in this type of didactic way,"" says Mashable Culture Editor Peter Allen Clark. Furthermore, the book's treatment of women is completely abhorrent. Montag's neighbor Clarisse is a manic pixie dream girl at best and the narrative is exceedingly unkind to Montag's wife Mildred, who is written as a two-dimensional stand-in for everything that's wrong in Bradbury's vision of the future. Where the book DOES succeed is in its world building, setting up a particularly unsettling atmosphere of this dystopian future. The novel's hunting robot the Hound, for instance, continues to inspire fear, due in large part to Bradbury's terrifying description of the beast: ""The Mechanical Hound slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live in its gently humming, gently vibrating, softly illuminated kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse... It was like a great bee come home from the field where the honey is full of poison wildness, of insanity and nightmare, its body crammed with that over-rich nectar and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself."" It's these types of descriptions and this type of world building that has seared Fahrenheit 451 into our collective memory. But here's to hoping that HBO's new adaptation can update the critiques that the famously modernity-phobic Bradbury (""I don't describe the future. I try to prevent it,"" Bradbury often said, reports the Peoria Journal Star ) tried to explore when he constructed a world that burns books. This week on the MashReads Podcast discuss Fahrenheit 451. Join us in the episode above as we talk about the experience of rereading the book as adults. Image: Simon &amp; Schuster Then, inspired by the novel, we talk about our other favorite books about books including Inkheart by Cornelia Funke, The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco, and How To Write An Autobiographical Novel by Alexander Chee. And as always, we close the show with recommendations: Martha recommends Spotify music podcast Dissect. Each season of the podcast focuses in on one music album, devoting each episode in the season to dissecting one song. The show just launched their third season which focuses on Frank Ocean's album Blonde. ""It's really, really fascinating. the host takes on each song and breaks down, track by track, the lyrics, the production. It's pretty fantastic."" Peter also recommends a podcast: The Next Picture Show. The show is a movie discussion podcast that takes a new movie and discusses it in relation to an older movie that it echoes. ""They speak about movies with a level of depth and knowledge that I really hope to possess one day. I really love these voices and these people and I think they're some of the best film reviewers in the world and I am glad I get to listen to them every two weeks."" MJ recommends two books. First he recommends The Power by Naomi Alderman, a novel that envisions a world where women suddenly have the power to shoot electricity from their hands. The book then explores what happens when women are given this power that men do not have. ""Once I started I could not put it down. What I love about the book is that premise is so simple, but I think the idea is so fully realized."" He also recommends Tin Man by Sarah Winman, which follows two characters and looks at love, grief, friendships, and more over the course of their lives. ""The book is so emotionally rich. It's beautiful, the entire book feels like poetry.""

Alison Foreman,"After a fierce Sunday of back-to-back playoff games between the final four, the NFL has its Super Bowl LIII competitors and Saints fans are furious.
They're channelling their frustration through Bird Box memes. 
In the final moments of a sudden death overtime period, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the New Orleans Saints 26-23, an upset many Saints fans blame on a controversial non-call from the fourth quarter. Rams defender Nickell Robey-Coleman has admitted to the alleged pass interference on Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis that effectively stopped what looked like a game winning drive by the Saints and led to overtime where the Rams won on a long field goal. 
However, even as Twitter has erupted over the botched call, there is likely no recourse for the Louisiana team. Except of course, more tweets.
SEE ALSO: A teenager crashed their car doing the ""Bird Box"" challenge
The missed call has inspired a torrent of back-and-forth debate between fans online as well as a number of memes, the most prominent of which is tied to Netflix's thriller Bird Box and its viral challenge.
Accusing NFL officials of trying out the #BirdBoxChallenge while on the job, fans have relentlessly photoshopped star Sandra Bullock's face onto the bodies of championship refs who were seemingly blind to the blatant foul. 
Others have ominously name-checked Bird Box in their NFL-related posts, allowing the connection to speak for itself.
Fans looking for more solace than a quick Bird Box chuckle have turned to an online petition requesting a rematch be ordered by NFL Commissioner Rodger Goodell if not of the whole game, then at least of the last few minutes.

Despite repeated attempts, they have not yet been allowed to return to their property.

We start choking up. When he is finally allowed back in, Mr. Westbrook will find a neighborhood in ruins. Houses are gone, trees stripped, power lines flattened. But there are odd patches of normalcy, testaments to the unpredictability of a wildfire. Down the block, an old Chevrolet El Camino was untouched. A festive lawn decoration in Mr. Westbrooks yard survived. And so did the Model T. The 1915 Ford, bought a year ago for $16,000, was just the latest antique car Mr. Westbrook had acquired. He had paid a mechanic to fix it up, and then practiced driving it on the country roads near his house, sometimes getting up to 35 m.p.h. But its skinny tires and unique pedal system made maneuvering it a challenge. He had recently put it up for sale.

The reporter returned with several packs of Pall Malls, his preferred brand of cigarettes, and some mouthwash. For sustenance, Mr. Jeys said that members of work crews in Paradise had given him sandwiches and bottles of water. Theyve also doled out other essentials, like batteries and bags of cat food. He repeatedly praised the generosity of those going house to house in the town looking for the remains of missing people who may have died in the fire. Since the fire hit, Mr. Jeys said he found himself grappling with feelings of guilt and bewilderment. He said he had listened to radio reports on the staggering number of people who died in the fire, now at 83, as well the hundreds listed as missing. I know people who escaped with only the clothes on their backs, he said. Others didnt make it out at all, and here I am. I find myself asking how that can be sometimes.

Sidney Fussell,"A fire-ravaged home in San Jose is selling for a staggering $800,000, local Fox affiliate KTVU reports. The high asking price is for both the abandoned home and the 5,800 square foot lot surrounding it. “They did leave it standing so you can remodel it versus tearing it down,” Realtor Holly Barr told KTVU. “You save a lot of money when you can leave a wall up and do a remodel versus a complete teardown.” The ruined building is close to the proposed Google Village in San Jose. Still in development, Google plans to build new offices, research sites and retail stores in the area. Barr said she received inquiries from potential buyers within hours of posting the ad and expects the home to sell within days. In Santa Clara County, the median price for a single family home is reportedly $1.4 million. Given the notoriously high housing costs in the area, realtors speaking to KTVU argued that renovating the shack would be cheaper than tearing it down to rebuild or buying a home in the area outright. Homes in the same neighborhood have recently sold for well over a million dollars, one said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","While dawn in California is still a few hours away, it will rise on a town completely changed. The 27,000-person community of Paradise was ravaged by the explosive Camp Fire last night. Early reports indicate the entire town was basically wiped out, and residents died or were severely burned trying to escape the inferno. Pretty much the community of Paradise is destroyed, its that kind of devastation, CALFIRE Captain Scott McLean said, according to the AP. The wind that was predicted came and just wiped it out. McLean estimated the fire had destroyed thousands of structures, which would immediately vault the Camp Fire into the record books as one of Californias most destructive fires in history. The nine worst fires the state have seen all burned at least 1,000 buildings, with the top three topping 2,000. Regardless of where it lands on the list, its clear that the Camp Fire has irrevocably changed the lives of thousands of people who stoodor still standin its path. The fire began in the Plumas National Forest, where it was first reported around 6:30 a.m. PT on Thursday. It grew explosively throughout the day as it marched westward. By 9:30 a.m., it had consumed at least 5,000 acres. Eleven hours later, that total was up to at least 20,000 acres, the flames urged on by powerful winds across a dry landscape. The town of Paradise sits right in the middle of the acres burned. As the fire unfolded throughout the day, reports on the police scanner recounted scenes of unspeakable terror. The speed that the fire grew caught residents off guard, and the evacuation slowed to a crawl in some places. Officials on the scanner reported abandoned cars and people running for shelter in local stores as the Camp Fire bore down on town. Residents confirmed the scenes to the AP. Things started exploding, Gina Oviedo told the AP. People started getting out of their vehicles and running. Videos posted to social media show heart-pounding footage of people driving through walls of flame and smoke in an effort to outrace the fire. Local news crews also spotted a fire whirlthe baby but no less terrifying cousin of firenados like the one sparked by the Carr Fire earlier this yearwhipping outside Paradise. With firefighters in full life-saving mode, the Camp Fire is essentially uncontained. Reports late Tuesday night indicate that it had jumped a highway and was spreading south and west including toward Chico, a town of 93,000. CALFIRE reports there are still 15,000 structures in harms way. Due to the fluid and rapidly changing conditions, residents are urged to stay updated through official sources for changes to evacuations and road closures, CALFIRE warned. Because of heavy web traffic, the Butte County Sheriff has been using Twitter to post the most updated evacuation information so if you live there, refresh it regularly. When the flames finally are put out and residents are able to return to Paradise, theyll find a vastly different place than the one they fled from. And theyll face a dilemma that more and more Californians have had to face : rebuild or leave. In a world where climate change is making wildfire season longer and fires more destructive, the former is an increasingly harrowing proposition.","While dawn in California is still a few hours away, it will rise on a town completely changed.

KIRK JOHNSON,"But getting to that point is hard. Infant mortality is a problem. Few seeds survive to germinate. Scientists trying to restore land devastated by wildfire say coating the seeds with the protective layer may help them through the vulnerable early days. The thinking is a little like swaddling a baby. The idea is still in testing. Along the way, the fires are also becoming their own brutal testing ground. They have gotten bigger, with more acres burned per fire. Last year came close to the record on that measure. And the fires are often hotter as well, enough in some cases to all but sterilize fragile rangeland soils deep below the surface, making regeneration harder. Why has so much rangeland been burned? It’s partly that this type of land is less treasured than the green, forested places that attract hikers, campers and nature lovers. Grass and sage country is important for ranchers, bird-watchers and for devotees of Edward Abbey and his book “Desert Solitaire.” But when blazes roar through, there are fewer people and buildings that must be defended. With limited budgets, firefighting agencies like the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have to prioritize. Many range fires burn until they go out on their own.","Wildfire has destroyed acres of rangeland. Now scientists are trying to restore it.

Back Story “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” the first Hollywood film to portray a kiss between a black man and a white woman, was released 50 years ago this week. It came out only six months after Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court case that struck down laws against mixed marriages in 16 states. Photo Their kiss was a milestone: Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.” Set against the backdrop of the civil rights era, the film — in which a white woman introduces her black fiancé to her parents — didn’t strike hard enough against racism, some critics said. The star, Sidney Poitier, was already a hit with white audiences, and he played a charming, Yale-educated doctor. Our review noted that “in a burst of incisive recognition that might also characterize the blue-chip film,” one character says, “Civil rights is one thing but this here is something else.” Even so, the film was a milestone for race relations in America, and it embodies how times have changed. The same year, the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, offered to resign if his daughter’s marriage to a black man caused embarrassment to President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Aimée Lutkin,"Falling in an out of love is a common experience that, unfortunately, frequently happens with the exact same partner. This is called “relationship cycling,” and it turns out it’s an even bigger emotional energy suck than it feels like. A new study from the journal Family Relations examined the “psychological distress” caused by breaking up and getting back together with someone over and over, The Cut reports. Anyone who has done this can tell you how awful it is, but now we have some research confirming why. For one, human beings don’t do well with uncertainty in our lives. If someone is supposed to be your rock, but they wobble underneath you, it’s very disorienting. In fact, the study’s overall conclusion was basically that we can’t handle these types of relationships, despite constantly having them: Patterns of breakup and renewal were linked to increased symptoms of psychological distress, indicating the accumulation of relationship transitions can create added turmoil for individuals. Yes. Yes, I know. The real issue is that every time you return to a relationship cycle, it gets worse. That makes lots of sense. In most other parts of our lives, when we get burned, we don’t keep touching the metaphorical stove! Yet, some combination of nostalgia, loneliness, or an addiction to the drama of it all will draw us back to a person we love but probably shouldn’t be with, again and again. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing: if you’re willing to work on your issues, it’s possible to grow together into a new and better relationship. According to the study, however, people are often reluctant to put that kind of effort into relationships they’re returning to. It’s already not worked out in the past, so why invest emotional energy in making it better? It’s like the thing we’ve been burned by is the relationship itself, but the person still attracts. This means that each iteration of your relationship is worse than the one that came before. That may explain why it sometimes feels like we have to break up with a person a few times before it sticks. If you really want to make it work with someone, you kind of have to treat an old relationship as though it’s brand new. That’s a pretty tall order. Maybe you’d be better off just starting fresh for real? Aimée Lutkin is a freelance writer who blogs a lot about dating. She is currently traveling the country and going on a date in every city she visits.","Falling in an out of love is a common experience that, unfortunately, frequently happens with the exact same partner.

"Darran Simon, CNN","(CNN) The abuse suffered by siblings at the hands of their parents in a Northern California home included being waterboarded, bitten and burned with scalding water, prosecutors said in court papers. The accusations were made in a motion filed Tuesday by Solano County prosecutors in an attempt to increase the bail of the children's mother, Ina Rogers, before her court appearance on Wednesday. Rogers, 30, and the children's father, Jonathan Allen, 29, face allegations of child neglect, torture and abuse involving their children after the children told investigators they had suffered puncture wounds, burns and bruising, as well as injuries consistent with being shot by pellet guns or BB guns in the Fairfield home. Authorities searched the Fairfield home of the couple and their 10 children in March and found them living in disgusting conditions, including animal and human feces spread on the floor, Fairfield police said. The children range in age from 4 months to 12 years old. ""During the investigation the children thoroughly described the incidents of abuse. On a continuous basis the children were getting punched, strangled, bitten, shot with weapons such as crossbows and BB guns, hit with weapons such as sticks and bats, subject to 'waterboarding' and having scalding water poured on them,"" Deputy District Attorney Veronica Juarez wrote in asking for a judge to set Rogers' bail at $495,000. On Tuesday, Rogers was charged with nine counts of felony child abuse, according to an amended complaint. She had faced an earlier misdemeanor charge of child cruelty. She pleaded not guilty on Wednesday and her bail was set at $495,000. Allen, who was charged Monday with nine counts of felony child abuse as well as seven counts of torture, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His bail is set at $5.2 million. Both Allen and Rogers are in custody. ""Obviously, the charges against Mr. Allen are very serious and we take them seriously. They are, of course, merely allegations at this point. Mr. Allen is presumed to be innocent and has pled not guilty. We absolutely intend to vigorously contest these allegations, but we intend to contest these allegations in court and not through the media,"" Allen's attorney Tommy Barrett said in a statement. CNN has reached out to Rogers' attorney. Rogers and Allen have denied wrongdoing in interviews with local media. Rogers told CNN affiliate KGO/KTXL, ""I strive and I pride myself on being a good parent to my children.""

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","In early December, the Thomas Fire erupted in Southern California. By the time it was fully contained some five weeks later, it had upended the lives of thousands of people. It also affected countless wild animals, including two bears that suffered severe burns on their paws. Less than two months later, those bears have made a miraculously quick recovery and are back in the wild thanks to an innovative healing technique: fish skin bandages. Two adult female black bears, along with a five-month old mountain lion, were rescued shortly after the fire by rescue workers. The bears had suffered third-degree burns on their paws, and one of them was too injured to even stand up. ( Warning : The photo below is pretty gnarly, if you’re squeamish about burned skin turn back now.) Jamie Peyton, with the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and Center for Advancing Pain Relief, originally estimated it would take four to six months for the wounds to heal. That was too long to keep the bears in captivity, especially after it was discovered one was pregnant. Frequently changing bandages and administration of pain medication were also serious logistical hurdles. So, she helped come up with an unusual healing technique. According to a news release, Peyton had heard about a group in Brazil using sterilized tilapia skins to treat human burns. She decided it was worth a try. The payoff was near immediate, as the sutured fish skins allowed the bears stand on their own, a sign that the burn pain was less crippling. In a matter of weeks, new skin had grown back on the bears’ paw pads. The tilapia wraps, which were made from live fish purchased at a nearby market, last for about 10 days before turning leathery and losing the collagen necessary to help repair skin. Along with the fish bandages, the bears also received acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, and cold laser therapy to help with pain and healing. Even though the bears’ original habitats were destroyed by the fire, they were released back into the wild on January 18, where their burns will continue to heal. Officials with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife moved dirt and logs to create new winter dens for them in Los Padres National Forest. The Thomas Fire burned more than 280,000 acres, destroyed over 1,000 structures, and forced over 100,000 people around Santa Barbara and Ventura to evacuate their homes. As California continues to recover from this conflagration and others, Peyton sees great promise in the new technique for treating future victims. “One animal can change the face of medicine,” Peyton said in a statement. “I think these bears and the mountain lion are inspiring us to think outside the box. These individual animals have contributed to promoting how we’re going to treat burns in the future.” The CDFW posted a complete photographic overview of the bears’ rescue, recovery, and release. The images are more graphic than those included here, but also more illuminating. Take a look for yourself.","In early December, the Thomas Fire erupted in Southern California.

SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Contamination has slowed recovery. Huddled in messy shelters at local fairgrounds, or holed up in motels, thousands of residents are anxious to start sifting through what is left of their town, but officials say they cannot reopen until the areas are made safer. When can I go home? asked Gregory Ghica, at a recent disaster relief meeting at the Silver Dollar Fairground in Chico. His house was spared, but no date has been set for when Paradise might be safe to re-enter. I should be happy, but I have slept in six different beds, Mr. Ghica said. When? When? Over 200 people are still declared missing, and search crews are combing the area looking for remains, slowing the ability of cleaning crews to enter. Hazardous material removal teams from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, in conjunction with other state and federal agencies, will begin the process of clearing out the most dangerous toxic materials on Dec. 3. Even then, it will be a long time until the area is deemed safe. Many of the homes in Paradise were older, with roofs that may have been shingled in asbestos, filled with treated wood that can release arsenic and chromium when burned. An incinerated television can expose heavy metals such as cadmium and lead. Even seemingly innocuous items, such as collectible antique Fiestaware crockery, may contain radioactive uranium. Mercury can leak from old thermometers. We understand the desire to physically go and see if their home or property is gone, said Lisa Almaguer, the spokeswoman for Butte County Public Heath.

Jon Fingas,"A total of 13 major publishers are involved in the pilot, including the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Seattle Times and San Francisco Chronicle. It's no secret as to why Facebook would be willing to mount this campaign. It could help boost Instant Articles subscriptions among the newspapers still involved in the service, and may reassure publishers that it still supports them. And of course, fostering the growth of established, respected news outlets could help fight fake news. The question is whether or not this will teach publishers enough to make a difference -- and, for that matter, whether or not it will bring back publishers burned by Facebook's past decisions to downplay news stories.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"During one Scottish womans lifetime, she has broken bones, burned her skin, and undergone surgery without feeling any painand she didnt realize shed been experiencing anything unusual until she was well into her 60s, according to a new case study.
Scientists are interested in people who feel little pain, as they hope to find ways to help those who do suffer from it. In this case, the woman had visited the hospital for a normally painful hand surgery but didnt require any painkillers afterward. Thinking that seemed odd, a team of researchers were able to pinpoint her condition as linked to a pair of genetic mutations.
The woman had previously been diagnosed with arthritis in her hip, which she didnt feel despite the severe degree of joint degeneration, according to the paper. She lived a long life of painlessness before realizing something strange was happening, reporting dental surgeries without anesthesia, painless cuts and broken bones, and even burns in which it took smelling her charred flesh to notice something was amiss. She even told the researchers she could eat scotch bonnet chili peppers with no effects other than a pleasant glow in her mouth. Oh, and she rarely felt any sort of anxiety, depression, fear, or panicnot even during a recent car accident, according to the paper.
Her doctors recommended she speak the pain genetics team from University College London, who sequenced parts of her, her childrens, and her mothers genomes and asked them about their pain tolerance. The culprit appeared to be a small set of missing DNA in the FAAH-OUT pseudogene, essentially degraded versions of fully functional genes once thought to be junk but which often do have a role. The woman also had a single switched nucleotide (the DNA building blocks) in her FAAH gene, the one responsible for an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase. Previous studies have also shown that people with small variations in their FAAH gene have less anxiety and feel less pain.
Now, the researchers hope to explore this portion of our genome to help those who suffer from chronic pain and anxiety, according to the paper published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia.
It is really exciting to work with rare patients with pain insensitivity and to hopefully identify new analgesic drug targets as a consequence of that work, study author James Cox, senior lecturer at the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research at the University College London, told Gizmodo.
The paper points out that previous drug trials attempting to stop pain by inhibiting FAAH production havent been fruitful. But, perhaps targeting the FAAH-OUT pseudogene instead might be a better strategy.
This is ultimately just one case study, and theres far more work to do before we can declare victory over pain. Nor is this the only part of the genome linked to pain. Other genes seem to affect how people feel pain, too, like in the case of Italian professor Letizia Marsili. Marsili feels no pain thanks to a mutation in her ZFHX2 gene.
Pain serves an important purpose, of courseit would suck to find out you were on fire because of the smell of your own burning flesh. But pain, especially chronic pain, can significantly reduce a persons quality of life, and new strategies for reducing pain are badly needed. Cox hopes that with the help of gene-editing technology, scientists will soon be able to devise new therapies for treating this age-old ailment.","During one Scottish woman’s lifetime, she has broken bones, burned her skin, and undergone surgery without feeling any pain—and she didn’t realize she’d been experiencing anything unusual until she was well into her 60s, according to a new case study.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"LOS ANGELES These are the places seared into the memories of local residents, the places many people who just come to visit never see. Now, after the fires that ripped through Southern California this month, they are unrecognizable, or unimaginable, as the spots where nature brought joy, peace or relief. The wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties were nowhere near as deadly as those in the north. But just as they destroyed homes, they also brought a different kind of devastation, ravaging many of the regions most prized outdoor recreation areas. Almost all of the federal land within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area a staggering 86 percent, totaling some 20,000 acres was burned by the Woolsey Fire, according to the National Park Service. Among the blackened and charred are the Old West film sets at the Paramount Ranch, which have been featured in movies and television shows for decades. The 155-year-old Diego Sepúlveda Adobe, a mission station that was still being restored from damage suffered in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, is now just a shell, in the words of one archaeologist.","Among the blackened and charred areas in Southern California were hiking trails overlooking the ocean, summer camps and historic movie sets.",2018-11-23T21:30:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",See How the Fires Burned Where California Goes to Escape It All,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/us/photos-california-fire-damage.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/15/us/00caldamage-01/00caldamage-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1
KIRK JOHNSON,"“People don’t know what goes into one little piece of trail,” Mr. Beebe said as he stood on the edge of the hole in well-worn hiking pants that had frayed at the cuffs. Distance hiking is about muscle and endurance, but also myriad fussy details of management — calories, hydration, dry socks and blisters. For Mr. Beebe, fire was just one more wrinkle. He had hiked more than 1,700 miles of the 2,650-mile trail by his first conversations with Ms. Prevo, and as he described his journey — and his mental map for the miles ahead around the blazes that were ripping through Oregon and Washington — she found herself deeply impressed. He was charming, she thought, but better yet, a nerd. “The way that you tackle a problem, and pick apart the various resources and stuff that you have for it — that’s a strange thing to love about somebody,” she said, looking at Mr. Beebe across a coffee shop table in Portland recently. “But I was just really attracted to that.” Mr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo have been out together five times now to work on fixing parts of the Pacific Crest Trail. They are planning for Ms. Prevo’s own solo hike on the trail in 2020, after she finishes an engineering degree. They intend to walk the first 86 miles from Canada, heading south together — the stretch Mr. Beebe, for all his improvisation, was unable to complete. He plans to be back in school by then anyway. He dropped out several times over the years, but intends to resume a study of computer science, partly inspired, he said, by a woman he met while he was walking in the woods.","Mark Beebe and Tara Prevo met over online conversations about hiking the famed trail.

Tom McKay,"11,000 years’ worth of artifacts went up in smoke as the 200-year-old National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro—one of the largest collections in the Americas—burned down in a massive firestorm on Sunday night. According to the Rio Times, reports indicate that every piece from the museum’s collection of over 20 million items that was not stored offsite or rushed out could be destroyed: Early reports indicate that the museum’s vast collection of more than twenty million rare and historical objects, including South American archaeological artifacts, meteorites, fossils, and the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts in Latin America, were lost. “We have no idea how it started!” exclaimed a museum researcher to Globo news. “There is so much love for this institution,” she said fighting through tears. “[T]his 200 year-old museum, this is the work of many people’s lives, zoological collections, botanical collections, everything lost…everything lost!” No serious injuries are reported. The fire started at 7:30pm ET, with the cause unclear, and museum officials have to wait for firefighters to finish clearing the structure before they can assess the damage, CNN wrote. Items in the building included Latin America’s most extensive Egyptian collection, pre-Columbian artifacts, the oldest human remains ever discovered in the Americas ( “Luzia” ), dinosaur bones, extensive biology exhibits, and a massive scientific library. Here’s a few other things that were stored in the building, according to the New York Times : One of the world’s largest meteorites, which was found in 1784 and had been on display since 1888.... Items from a large swatch of Brazilian cultures, including funeral urns from around the year 1000 in the region of the Maracá River, statues and vases from the Santarém culture in the region of the lower Tapajós River, a mortar from the Trombetas River area and a rare mummy found in Brazil.... A Greco-Roman collection with more than 700 pieces that arrived in Brazil in the 1850s.... A vast bird collection almost 200 years old, representing the range seen in Brazil. (The meteorite was among the items that may have survived the fire.) According to the BBC, at least some parts of the building where animal specimens were stored survived intact, while the Guardian reported other parts of the archive stored in another building were undamaged. Museum staff were able to rush in, in some cases bashing down doors, and save some items. Professor Paulo Buckup, an expert in fish science, told the BBC he rescued “a few thousand” mollusk specimens, adding, “I don’t know how many tens of thousands of insects and crustaceans were lost. I feel very sorry for my colleagues, some of whom have worked here for 30 or 40 years. Now all evidence of their work is lost, their lives have lost meaning, too.” “This is 200 years of work of a scientific institution—the most important one in Latin America,” longtime museum employee Marco Aurelio Caldas told Agencia Brasil, per CNN. “Everything is finished. Our work, our life was all in there.” Brazil has been facing years of recession and corruption scandals, with both the federal and state governments struggling with massive budget shortfalls. According to the BBC, museum staff said lack of funding had left the museum in poor condition, and around a third of the building’s 30 exhibition halls were shut down due to financial constraints at the time of the fire. Vice director Luiz Duarte told TV Globo the fire was an “unbearable catastrophe,” according to the Guardian. “For many years we fought with different governments to get adequate resources to preserve what is now completely destroyed,” Duarte added. “My feeling is of total dismay and immense anger.” [ CNN / Rio Times ]","11,000 years’ worth of artifacts went up in smoke as the 200-year-old National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro—one of the largest collections in the Americas—burned down in a massive firestorm on Sunday night.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"The asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago didn’t just suck for the big lizards. Shockwaves likely knocked down the trees, fires would have burned up entire forests, and less light would have meant fewer plants. What if you were a bird who lived in those trees! That was your home! New research shows how the strike would have decided which species made it and which species didn’t. Without trees, only ground-dwelling birds would have survived. This surely would have had a profound impact on the kinds of species still around today—a bottleneck in evolution’s history that changed the course of life forever. “The elimination of forests basically left a long-term signature on the subsequent evolutionary history of birds,” study author Daniel J. Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Bath, told Gizmodo. “We think that only non-tree dwelling bird species would be able to pass through.” The researchers created their hypothesis by looking at a host of different data points. For example, tree pollen went missing from the fossil record for a thousand years after the asteroid strike. Bird fossils from that time period seem only to consist of ground-dwellers. Put that together, and the story emerges: An asteroid hit Earth and wiped out the trees, meaning an evolutionary dead-end for any bird that couldn’t make do elsewhere. The study was published in Current Biology. You might ask why are there so many tree-dwelling birds today. It seems that once the forests came back, there was a massive diversification of species, and birds would have capitalized on the new niches and colonized them quickly, said Field. Other scientists said this research is an interesting way to tell the evolutionary story following the mass extinction. “This paper presents an intriguing explanation for why only a few lineages of birds survived the mass extinction event and then later diversified tremendously in response to recovering habitats,” Sushma Reddy, assistant professor in biology at Loyola University Chicago, who was not involved with the study, told Gizmodo. “It sets a new hypothesis to be tested as more fossils are discovered.” But absence of evidence isn’t the evidence of absence—just because you don’t find something doesn’t mean it’s not there. There could be more to the story yet to uncover. “For the fossils we know about, it fits the hypothesis laid out here. However, birds are notorious for have a very limited fossil record,” said Reddy. Perhaps there’s more evidence to support the hypothesis in other groups of animals, like mammals. Still, mass extinctions are important pages in the book of Earth’s history. Life, uh, finds a way.

Tom McKay,"A burned-out husk of a home in San Jose, California that looks like something out of a post-apocalyptic movie—but which happens to be close to the proposed site of the $67 million Google Village lots —has sold for far more than its original listing price of $800,000. Real estate listings show that the fire-ravaged shack (as well as its 5,800-foot square lot) has sold for $938,000, or just a little over 17 percent of the original asking price. Photos of the lot show it’s perfect for a coven of sunlight-fearing vampires, Tom Hank’s character in The Money Pit, a tech employee with enough extra cash on hand to burn on a replacement or rebuild, or Silence of the Lambs secondary antagonist Buffalo Bill. Realtor Holly Barr, who was managing the property, told KTVU that the house was originally left standing because it could conceivably be possible to remodel what remains of the building instead of building a new house on the plot. “They did leave it standing so you can remodel it versus tearing it down,” Barr told KTVU. “You save a lot of money when you can leave a wall up and do a remodel versus a complete teardown.” While locals told KTVU that the high price for the destroyed house was a little ridiculous—and a perfect example of how tech companies are making the cities they take up residence in unaffordable—Rick Smith of the Santa Clara Realtors Association told the station that “Buyers are trading money for time all the time now so they can be closer to their employment.” In fact, buying the home may ultimately end up being a good investment given that the median price for a house in the area is around $1.4 million, KTVU added.

Kristen V. Brown,"A tiny Utah biotech firm is making waves in regenerative medicine. Last summer, it made headlines for successfully regenerating skin and stimulating hair growth in pigs with burns using a stem cell therapy. Now, the company says its therapy is working on a badly burned 10-year-old boy. The Salt Lake City Tribune reports that the firm, PolarityTE, is now testing its treatment at more than a dozen hospitals around the country. But, the paper reported, the company has only disclosed the name of one of those hospitals. And its therapy, called SkinTE, did not endure the rigor of traditional phased clinical trials, nor evaluation by federal regulators, due to the way it is registered with the Food and Drug Administration. But perhaps most bizarre detail of all is how the company raised funding: Rather than turn to traditional VC investors, it merged with a failing, publicly traded video game company, arriving on the NASDAQ in March with the stock ticker “COOL.” The company’s therapy is a stem cell mixture intended to be spread in a thick paste over burns. Skin grafts are the typical treatment for burn victims, but they are thin and fragile and cannot grow hair, making the quest to successfully regenerate skin a sort of biomedical holy grail. In November, Italian researchers announced that they were able to almost entirely reconstruct the skin of a seven-year-old boy afflicted with a painful genetic condition that effects the skin using a combination of stem cells and gene therapy. In a press release by the company earlier this month, a New Orleans doctor at the Children’s Hospital in New Orleans stated that “the product has quickly regenerated skin with minimal marginal wound contracture and areas of regenerated skin are re-pigmenting rapidly.” The company’s CEO told the Salt Lake City Tribune that the therapy will “change the face and practice of regenerative medicine” for burn victims and others with deep wounds. But the company has attracted skeptics, and it highlights the troubles that plague stem cell products. SkinTE is registered with the FDA as a human cellular and tissue product, which drastically reduces the number of hurdles it must clear to be marketed commercially. In general, the FDA’s regulatory approach is risk-based, with fewer regulations applying to products that are considered less risky. Stem cells procedures like PolarityTE’s often fall into that category because cells are harvested from a patient’s own body, making adverse effects less likely. But that doesn’t mean that the therapies will work, just that the agency thinks they are unlikely to harm someone. In October, the firm White Diamond Research issued a 14-page critique of the PolarityTE, saying it lacks data necessary to convince physicians it will work. For now, whether it’s the breakthrough it claims to be is hard to judge. [ Salt Lake City Tribune ]","A tiny Utah biotech firm is making waves in regenerative medicine.

Rhett Jones,"In response to the record-setting $5 billion fine recently levied against Google by the European Union, the search giant is making some changes. On Tuesday, it announced that manufacturers will soon have to pay a licensing fee to ship devices into the European Economic Area (EEA) with Google apps pre-installed. Googles Android operating system controls more than 80 percent of the worlds mobile market share. Its ubiquity is based on it being a quality product and free, open source software. But the full-featured version of the Android OS has required device makers to pre-install a package of Googles apps like Search and Chrome. This helped cement Googles massive ad business, because users often just accept the stock apps that come with their phones. But European regulators successfully argued that Googles practices gave it an unfair advantage against competitors. In July, a court ordered it to change its practices. And this afternoon, Google outlined how it intends to comply in a blog post. First and foremost, Android will remain open source and device makers will be allowed to tweak the software to their own specifications. Theyll also be allowed to make their own choices when it comes to pre-installing software. But Google explained that its mobile application suite (Play Store, Gmail, YouTube, Maps etc) will require a license fee if pre-installed on devices shipping to the EEA and a separate license would be required for Search and Chrome. Weve reached out to Google for more information on how the license fees will be structured, but we did not receive an immediate reply. At first glance, this might seem like Google using its muscle to pass the consequences of its pseudo-monopolistic behavior onto others. But this is how the regulators moves were intended to work out. Now, competitors have a certain amount of motivation to build rival products or strike deals with manufacturers to pre-install existing software. The question is whether its too late for competitors, in general. Even a company as big as Microsoft has found it incredibly difficult to compete with Googles search engine. Apples Maps rival has floundered. And no one has come close to beating YouTube in the user-generated video streaming market. Still, most of these services have struggled because of the Catch 22 situation in which they need more users generating content and algorithmic data. If competing apps come pre-installed on an Android phone, they could theoretically edge their way into Googles space. Another open question is whether manufacturers will even bother to pay the license fee or pre-install rival apps at all. Outside of including a browser, everything else can just be downloaded from Google by the user after they purchase their device. Why pay a fee when you can just install Firefox and suggest some links? Google says these changes will go into effect on October 29, but its not all set in stone just yet. The company is currently appealing the EUs antitrust decision.

Lucas Matney,"Netflix users burned a lot of time watching content in 2017, though metrics seem to point that users have been watching less and less on average over time. In a year-end blog post, the streaming service announced that users watched more than 140 million hours of content per day, or 1 billion hours per week. As of Q3 2017, the company has more than 109 million subscribers, a little less than half of which are in the US. While this is undoubtedly an impressive feat for the streaming service, compared to past metrics, it also suggests that users may be watching fewer hours content on the service compared to years past. Though there weren’t any similar metrics given for 2016, at the end of 2015, Netflix announced that its 74.7 million users it had at the time had watched 42.5 billion hours of content that year. That suggests about 570 hours per year per account in 2015, though the math is obviously a little rough since sign-ups occur throughout the year. Nevertheless with 109 million users watching 1 billion hours per week in 2017, the average has moved to around 480 hours per account, suggesting that as the company has scaled, its users might not have been logging quite as many hours of screen time. Competition in the streaming market has obviously picked up in this time as Hulu, HBO Go and Amazon’s Prime video service have invested in original content more heavily and grown libraries. Most of Netflix’s subscriber growth has also taken place in international markets during this time as well after they made moves in early 2016 announcing the expansion to 130 new countries. On a more comical note, in addition to detailing total hours watched, the site laid out some bizarre factoids, highlighting the odd streaming habits of some of its users, this included one account which streamed Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl each day for 365 days in a row and another that binged the entirety of Shameless while in Antartica. More sane movie fans were also a plenty on the service — the average user watched 60 movies on Netflix. Netflix stock is up about 50 percent year-over-year.

Ed Cara,"Some people commemorate time spent together by etching their names onto an old tree or desk; others might get matching tattoos; and some just send a card. None of these gestures of love and camaraderie were enough for British surgeon Simon Bramhall, who burned his initials into at least two of his patients’ livers. Another doctor stumbled across Bramhall’s handiwork while performing follow-up surgery on one of the transplant patients in 2013, and he reported it to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where Bramhall worked, which then suspended him, according to the Washington Post. Although Bramhall was briefly reinstated in April 2014, he decided to voluntarily resign a month later in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the hospital. This Tuesday, the AP reported, Bramhall pled guilty to not one but two counts of assault by beating (he avoided a more serious charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm). The guilty plea not only accounts for the female patient whose liver he branded in 2013, but another male transplant patient that same year. The 53-year-old Bramhall has been released on bail for now, and his sentencing is scheduled for January. With a hint of understatement, following Bramhall’s plea, Crown Prosecutor Tony Badenoch said, “This has been a highly unusual and complex case... It is factually, so far as we have been able to establish, without legal precedent in criminal law.” The device Bramhall used to key the livers is called an argon beam coagulator. Using a stream of argon gas that conducts an electric current, the device can stop bleeding or help sketch out the areas of the liver that need to be operated on. Ordinarily, the marks the device makes are hardly damaging and fade away quickly, since the beam only penetrates the surface of tissue. Unfortunately for Bramhall, the liver he was caught branding was in bad shape already and so didn’t heal right, leaving his ‘SB’ easy to spot. Left unanswered in this insane story is why Bramhall did it. At the time, he was a celebrated surgeon of 12 years who got a round of atta-boys in 2010 after he performed a transplant surgery using a liver that had been rescued from a burning plane. In 2014, following his resignation, he admitted having made a mistake, while adding with no hint of awareness the situation had made him feel “a bit raw.” Bramhall’s case may be without legal precedent, but he somehow isn’t the first doctor to be caught branding his patients. In 1999, a doctor carved his initials onto his patient’s abdomen following a C-section, and in 2010, a gynecologist was sued after he laser-burned his initials on the uterus he removed from his 47-year-old patient. On the other hand, at least Bramhall isn’t the fertility doctor who was caught donating his own sperm to impregnate around 50 of his unsuspecting patients.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Washington state Governor Jay Inslee announced hes running for president mere days ago, and hes already going hard on the primary focus of his campaign: climate change.
Speaking with George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week on Sunday, Inslee addressed the huge cost to our economy, to our health, to our national security if we as a nation do not properly work to address climate change. Asked by Stephanopoulos about what sacrifices Americans will have to make to combat the issue, Inslee countered with the potentially catastrophic price of doing nothing.
If you net this out, whats going to require sacrifices is the course of inaction, Inslee said. Youve got to understand there are enormous costs of doing nothing here. It means were going to have more Paradise, Californias.
Inslee is referring to the community of Paradise that was burned to the ground in the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californias history. According to Cal Fire, nearly 90 deaths were linked to the devasting fire, which burned more than 153,000 acres and consumed nearly 14,000 residences and thousands of other structures. With nowhere to go and some left jobless after their employers or businesses burned to the ground, many Paradise residents were forced to take up temporary residence in a tent city in a Walmart parking lot in neighboring Chico.
People are going to bear this burden, particularly frontline communities, marginalized communities, who are going to be flooded and burned out, Inslee said. And hes right. A study published last year in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One found that wildfires hit black and Native American communities especially hard. Indeed, multiplereports and studies have projected that the effects of climate change will hit poor communities the hardest.
With tackling climate change as the focus of his presidential campaign, Inslee has pledged to fight for environmental and economic justice for indigenous communities and communities of color. He also plans to create millions of good-paying jobs over the next decade in the clean energy sector, the embrace of which he said on This Week will present an enormous economic advantage.
To boot, he says hell do it all without accepting fossil fuel or corporate PAC money, which certainly isnt the case for some other democratic 2020 frontrunners.

Timothy B. Lee,"reader comments 1 Tesla is 15 years old, but it's still fundamentally a startup. And being a startup in the capital-intensive car business means raising billions of dollars to spend on manufacturing infrastructure. In recent months, as Tesla races toward volume production of its mass-market Model 3 sedan, some analysts have warned that Tesla could be months away from running out of cash. The company burned through more than $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018, ending the quarter with less than $2.7 billion in the bank. Tesla likely has even less than that today—we'll find out how much less when Tesla announces its second quarter financial results next week. Adding to the pressure is Tesla's massive debt. Tesla has more than $10 billion in total debt, and more than $1 billion of that could come due in the next eight months. In recent months, Tesla has taken a series of measures to shore up its financial position. Tesla laid off about nine percent of its workforce last month in a major cost-cutting step. Tesla also opened up Model 3 orders to everyone in the US and Canada. Placing an order requires a $2,500 deposit, which will give the company an additional cash infusion. Then this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla was pressuring suppliers for more favorable financial terms—including, in at least one case, partial retroactive refunds of past payments. According to the Journal, a memo to one supplier ""described the request as essential to Tesla’s continued operation."" Asked about this, a Tesla spokesperson told Ars that the company has ""asked fewer than 10 suppliers for a reduction in total capex project spend for long-term projects that began in 2016 but are still not complete."" Tesla says that with other suppliers, it has only asked for lower prices for future orders. Tesla has had boom and bust cycles before The most important thing that will—hopefully—reduce Tesla's cash burn rate is achieving volume production of its Model 3 vehicles. Work on the Model 3 assembly line should be winding down—reducing capital spending—while increased production of Model 3 cars should mean more money coming in from customers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in April that Tesla will achieve positive cash flow and profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. That claim has attracted a lot of skepticism from Wall Street, but there's good reason to think that Tesla's financial situation will at least improve in the next few months. After all, Tesla has been through all of this before. Tesla suffered dramatically negative cash flow before launching each of its previous two vehicles—the Model S and the Model X. The scale of the losses are bigger this time because the Model 3 is a much higher-volume product. But fundamentally, Tesla is trying to follow the same successful script it followed with previous car launches. To get a perspective on Tesla's current losses, it's helpful to look back at the history of Tesla's free cash flow: Free cash flow isn't the same as profit. If Tesla spends $1 million for a piece of equipment, accountants will subtract that full amount from free cash flow in the current quarter. By contrast, when computing profit, accountants will treat it as an asset that depreciates over several years. This means that the more heavily a company is investing, the worse its free cash flow will look—even if those investments ultimately turn out to be highly profitable. Manufacturing cars requires a lot of big, expensive investments, so it's no surprise that Tesla has had dramatically negative cash flow for most of its 15-year existence. That negative cash flow has required Tesla to raise billions of dollars from investors and lenders. And as this chart shows, there's a clear pattern to Tesla's free cash flow. As the company nears the release of a new car—first the model S, then the Model X, and now the Model 3—cash flow losses soar. But then about a year later, cars start coming off the assembly line in significant volume, generating revenue that offsets the manufacturing expenses and turning free cash flow positive—at least briefly. For example, Tesla enjoyed modestly positive free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of 2013. Tesla probably could have continued enjoying positive cash flow into 2014 if it hadn't begun work on the Model X. The magnitude of negative cash flow has been much bigger for the Model 3 than for earlier cars because the Model 3 is a bigger, more ambitious project. Higher-volume assembly requires more investment in equipment and hiring more people to work the assembly line. But there's every reason to expect the same basic pattern to repeat—with cash flow turning positive some time soon—maybe even in the current quarter. Investor and lender confidence is key The big question is whether Tesla can achieve positive cashflow before it runs out of money—or if not, whether it will be able to raise additional funds to cover the shortfall. As we noted above, Tesla had $2.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Tesla burned through $3.4 billion in 2017 and more than $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018. If that burn rate were to continue, Tesla would need to raise more money before the end of the year. But as we've seen, we can expect Tesla's burn rate to start improving soon, as Tesla finally reaps significant revenues from sales of new vehicles. Still, even with that additional revenue, things are going to be tight. Tesla likely burned through significant cash in the second quarter—again, we'll find out how much next week. Tesla will need to pay off a $230 million convertible loan in November unless Tesla's stock rises to $560.64 (in which case the debt would convert to Tesla stock). Then Tesla will owe $920 million on another convertible loan unless the stock price is above $359.87. Tesla also faces some other headwinds. Some reports also suggest that Tesla has work to do building out its infrastructure for servicing vehicles once they've been sold. Tesla has historically relied on selling zero-emission vehicle credits to other carmakers, but with electric cars becoming more common the value of these credits is expected to fall. Tesla's customers will also lose access to a generous federal tax credit next year, which might undercut demand for Tesla's cars. The obvious solution is to raise additional funds, either by taking out loans or by selling shares on Wall Street. Enlarge / For Tesla, a successful Model 3 could go a long way toward easing its financial concerns (here's the car on display at the Tesla Store in Washington, DC). But getting additional loans could be difficult—or at least expensive. Tesla already has a lot of debt, and creditors may be reluctant to lend Tesla even more. The bond rating agency Moody's downgraded Tesla's debt back in March, causing Tesla's outstanding bonds to trade well below face value. And there are other signs that investors are getting nervous about Tesla's debt. The cost of credit default swaps—essentially, insurance policies against a default on Tesla debt— has been rising in recent days, suggesting investors are worried that Tesla might be a bad credit risk. At a minimum, this means that if Tesla borrowed additional money it would have to pay a significantly higher interest rate. And the longer Tesla waits, the more difficult it could become for Tesla to borrow significant sums. The other option is to sell more stock. While bond markets seem worried about Tesla, stock traders still seem fairly bullish. Markets value Tesla at around $50 billion, so the company should be able to raise $1 billion if it expands its outstanding stock by two percent. That would give Tesla a nice cash cushion and reassure everyone involved about Tesla's solvency. Musk has said he has no plans to raise more money. Tesla's critics have suggested that the company is avoiding raising money from Wall Street because doing so would trigger legal disclosure requirements that could force Tesla to reveal embarrassing information to shareholders. There are a variety of rumors swirling around Twitter about what kind of information Tesla might be forced to disclose, but we haven't been able to confirm any of them, so we're not going to repeat any of that here. Another possibility is that Musk just honestly believes it's unnecessary. Musk is Tesla's biggest shareholder, and he bought still more Tesla stock just last month. Selling stock would mean diluting the profits of existing shareholders—including Musk himself—and he may simply not see a need to do that. The larger question for both shareholders and lenders is whether Tesla is on track to ultimately be a profitable company. If people have confidence in Tesla's long-term vision, it won't be hard to find people willing to provide the company with the capital it needs to cover its short-term expenses. On the other hand, if people start to doubt Tesla's long-term prospects, that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as liquidity constraints make it harder for Tesla to execute in the short run. This means the next few months will be critical for the company. If Tesla exceeds expectations, its cash flow problems should quickly ease and it can focus on growth once again. Conversely, if investors lose faith in Tesla, that could threaten Tesla's ability to raise more capital, posing an existential threat to the company. We'll learn a lot next week when Tesla reveals its second quarter financial results. We'll find out how much of the company's $2.7 billion cash pile Tesla burned through between April and June as it scrambled to hit the target of producing 5,000 cars per week. And we'll learn how profitable the Model 3 has been—which will provide a clue about how much higher Model 3 production will improve Tesla's financial situation.",Tesla has burned through billions.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","We thought the problems of the “V steam” were widely understood, but recently Chrissy Teigen posted on Instagram that she’s trying a vaginal steam despite not being sure whether it will work or whether, perhaps, her vagina might dissolve. The procedure, done at a spa, involves sitting over a steaming bowl of herbs. Gwyneth Paltrow once endorsed the mugwort steam at a Korean style spa in Santa Monica, saying the process “cleanses your uterus, et al. It’s an energetic release.” Other V-steam proponents have claimed that it balances your hormones, cures cancer, and other things that it is not proven to do. There’s no reason to believe the “can’t hurt” idea, either: if actual steam contacts your vulva or vagina, you could get burned. “I’d hate to be dealing with intravaginal burns,” gynecologist Mary Jane Minkin told Self. And if there’s enough plant material to possibly be absorbed through your skin or mucous membranes (doubtful) then there are potential harms, too. Mugwort is a close relative of ragweed, and you don’t want an allergic reaction in your vagina either.

Thomas Page,"arts Published 1st October 2018 America, fall 1968. Martin Luther King Jr., dead. Robert F. Kennedy, dead. The Vietnam War raged on, while at home racial and social inequality burned deep. From the Democratic National Convention to the streets of Baltimore, a country staggered towards a presidential election in paroxysms of violence. On Oct. 1, a month before the vote, an unassuming indie flick called ""Night of the Living Dead"" premiered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Horror was never the same again. Directed by George A. Romero on a tiny budget, the movie told the story of an undead apocalypse gripping the US. With its taboo-breaking gore and documentary-like approach, the movie sent the modern zombie lurching into the nation's imagination, terrifying audiences and beguiling them with subtext. If 1967 was defined by the Summer of Love, 1968 was the morning after the night before. ""There was a good deal of anger that the '60s didn't work,"" said Romero in 2012, five years before his death. ""There was a bit of rage, a bit of disappointment."" ""Night of the Living Dead"" communicated many of the nation's anxieties -- albeit unintentionally, most agree. Tom Savini and Greg Nicotero, the special effects makeup pioneers and Romero's long-time friends and collaborators, spoke to CNN in separate phone calls. They described ""coincidental"" color-blind casting and ""subliminal choices"" that resulted in ubiquitous symbolism and allegory, despite Romero having ""no political motivations."" Focusing on a small cast of survivors who barricade themselves in a farmhouse against the zombie onslaught, the group ""for better or for worse come to represent what America is,"" said Gregory Waller, director of cinema and media studies at Indiana University, in a phone interview. Inside the house, discord reigns as the nuclear family is torn apart. The young couple fly the coop, only to go up in flames. White turns on black; black turns on white. Most poignantly, Romero's young lead, played by African American actor Duane Jones, overcomes the zombies only to be shot dead by white vigilantes before the credits roll. That allegory was topical in 1968. Fifty years on, it still is. The zombie acted as a catalyst. But at this nascent stage, how best to read it? ""(Romero) took elements of the voodoo zombie genre that began with the RKO Val Lewton movies, mixed in some vampirism and cannibalism, and created a super strain of the undead,"" director and genre buff Edgar Wright told CNN via email. In appearance, the zombie was nearly human, with lumbering gait, mouth agape and eyes vacant. The way to destroy them was clear (destroy the brain), as was the way they were created (zombie bite or corpse reanimation after the zombie advent). There was no precedent, said Nicotero: ""(Romero) didn't define the rules. He invented the rules."" But the semiotics of zombies were far from concrete. Romero had created a demon that refused to explain itself and was impossible to reason with. You could never ask a zombie why. It just was. It was this blankness, said Waller, that made the zombie and the genre ""remarkably flexible."" In ""Night of the Living Dead,"" Romero dressed his zombies as white-collar workers and housewives in their nighties, suggesting a nation sleepwalking through a disaster. It also showed that aesthetics were vital in constructing a metaphor. The zombie form has since become a palimpsest ready to be overdrawn, and for 50 years the undead have been appropriated by every filmmaker willing to grapple with them. So what has the zombie ravaged so far -- and where is it staggering to next? 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth' -- 'Dawn of the Dead' Shortly after ""Night of the Living Dead,"" a slew of low-budget European zombie movies materialized. Few had as much to say. It took Romero himself to dig deeper into the genre, with his 1978 sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"" posing the question: Do these blank, rapacious faces also reflect something awful about ourselves? ""Dawn of the Dead"" took on class and consumerism. Beginning in an urban housing project, it showed how even during a zombie apocalypses, it was the poorest who suffered most acutely. Later, survivors hole up in a shopping mall, where zombies wander aimlessly and humans overindulge alongside them. One character describes the undead as ""pure motorized instinct."" Another muses that ""this place was important in their lives."" ""It's like (Romero) had read the stuff that people had written about the first movie,"" Waller speculated. Savini oversaw special effects makeup for the sequel, as well as performing stunt work and playing the anarchic biker, Blades. Romero was now using color film stock, and with hundreds of zombies on screen, there was a greater need to differentiate them from humans. So Savini made them gray, a nod to the movie's black and white predecessor. ""That kind of backfired,"" Savini said -- the crew couldn't create consistent lighting in the mall, turning zombies blue or green, but rarely ever the gray he wanted. Nonetheless, a new aesthetic had been established. Savini described his time as a US Army combat photographer in Vietnam as ""a lesson in anatomy."" Gore popped with new clarity as he used prosthetics to mutilate faces and separate flesh from bone. ""Nobody ever said art had to be in good taste,"" Roger Ebert quipped with admiration. By the time ""Day of the Dead"" came along in 1985, Romero had turned his creation on Reagan-era politics, dragging mad scientists and army brutes into the mire. The existential threat was something to be conditioned and educated by one camp, annihilated without prejudice by the other. Interestingly, it painted zombies in a sympathetic light, labeling humans as the more dangerous, irrational party. ""That's my masterpiece with George,"" said Savini. ""Tom really wanted to show that there had been an advance in the decline and decomposition of the zombies,"" added Nicotero, who was Savini's assistant at the time. Every zombie now looked individual, a corpse wearing its own backstory. Savini said this angered some fans who expected more of the same after ""Dawn."" But this new approach helped when shaping the most famous zombie in the Romero cannon: Bub. Trained by Richard Liberty's modern-day Frankenstein, Bub, played by Howard Sherman, learned to appreciate music, salute his military superior and fire a weapon. He demonstrated that the zombie was not beyond redemption or beyond civility. For that, Bub couldn't be ""decrepit in body,"" because ""he's becoming more human"" explained Savini. Bub, memorably, realizes his humanity by shooting his oppressor. Since the original ""Dead"" trilogy, Romero's grip on the zombie loosened as other filmmakers weighed in. By the early 21st century the undead were running in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" (2002) and Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake in 2004 -- much to Romero's chagrin. (""George sold bumper stickers that said 'Fast zombies suck,'"" Savini recalled.) At the box office, meanwhile, Romero's ""Land...,"" ""Diary..."" and ""Survival of the Dead"" (2005-2009) were running to play catchup. One title that did win critical approval was ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), Wright's rom-zom-com and self-declared ""valentine"" to Romero. With its nucleus of late-20s slackers, Wright said the zombie ""stand(s) in for the perils of living in your own solipsistic bubble of problems."" But ""Shaun of the Dead"" was one of few films to resemble Romero's claustrophobic "" morality plays,"" as he called them. An increasingly crowded marketplace has since filled with zombie Nazis, zombie strippers, zombies on a plane and zombies on a train. This popularity has come at a price, argued Waller. With proliferation, the genre's social commentary ""gets less and less cogent, to my mind,"" he said, ""just because there are so many versions of this story."" ""The dead are everywhere these days,"" Romero lamented in 2016. ""As far as I'm concerned, I'm content to wait until sort zombies die off."" They haven't yet. The hit TV show ""The Walking Dead"" and spin-off ""Fear the Walking Dead,"" executive produced by Nicotero, have 12 seasons between them so far. For his own sake (and arguably the fans'), Nicotero has ensured that his writers stick to Romero's unofficial guidelines. ""I'm very fond of the rules,"" he said. ""We've never talked about where the zombie apocalypse comes from,"" he added. ""The truth of the matter is: it doesn't matter. It's not about how it started, it's about how the events reshaped the world."" But today of all days, it feels pertinent to ask: Is there any fresh ground left for the undead to cover? After moldering for half a century, the zombie could be forgiven for feeling dead on its feet. Wright admitted to feeling tired of the genre. ""I think we should give them a little rest so they can come clawing back in a more surprising way,"" he suggested. ""We're are now parodying... the walking dead we have in our society, staring at phones,"" said Savini. Nicotero also compares zombies and technology, describing a virus-like spread: ""Before you know it, it's taken over."" Technology's slow creep into our lives -- and our surrender to it -- feels ominous. If a zombie is known for anything, it's a lack of respect for personal space. So what more fitting a metaphor for the digital age? At a time when privacy is being eroded, anonymous trolls plague online discourse and silent collectives can be whipped up to destructive ends, we lose something as we pour ourselves out onto the Internet. Too often our likes, our beliefs, our relationships and our common bonds live in cyberspace, not in flesh. The skeptic might argue our identity has been uploaded -- a set of data points to be manipulated and guided through life, directed to consume. ""Maybe there's a little zombie in all of us, eh?"" Romero teased back in 1978. Perhaps it's still true. For half a century, they have been a willing metaphor, waiting in the wings. Where the zombie turns next depends entirely on our faults. But rest assured, they will come. As Wright said: ""You can never leave the undead buried for long.""","America, fall 1968. Martin Luther King Jr., dead. Robert F. Kennedy, dead.

 (CNN)Of all of the crazy sounding things in the pantheon of modern physics, it's hard to beat a black hole. Generally speaking, black holes are the burned-out hulks of long dead stars, with a strong enough gravitational field that not even light can escape them. 
The gravity near a black hole is so strong that it warps the very fabric of space and time. Black holes sound more like science fiction than fact, but there has been considerable indirect evidence that they exist. They are accepted by the scientific community in spite of an embarrassing admission: nobody has ever directly seen one. Well, until now.
Scientists have announced the first direct observation of a black hole at the center of a galaxy named M87. M87 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It is one of the largest galaxies in the nearby universe. (Where ""nearby"" is the staggering distance of 53 million light years. Astronomers really do think big.) 
Now a little bit of care is necessary to understand exactly what was done. Black holes are, well, black. By definition, they do not emit any light. So, the black hole was not observed directly. However, black holes are also surrounded by ordinary matter that is caught in the hole's gravitational grip. 
This matter, which is typically just gas of the same type that makes up our sun, orbits the black hole at very high speeds. All of that fast-moving gas gets heated up to the point where it glows and emits all sorts of forms of electromagnetic radiation, from heat to light to radio waves. Intervening gas blocks the visible heat and light, so astronomers look for the radio waves.
You'd think that astronomers would announce that they detected this halo of radio waves surrounding the hole, and that is part of the story. However, it's more complicated than that. Because of the very strong gravity near the black hole, some of the light and radio waves are captured by it and don't escape. The result is that a black hole looks like a ring of light, with a shadow in the middle. Essentially, from a distance, picture astronomers released of the M87 black hole looks like a coffee ring left on a piece of paper, albeit a colored one. 
Since the astronomers used radio waves to see the black hole, the colors aren't what you would see with your eye. But they do have meaning. What we are seeing is the gas surrounding the black hole. One side is bright and one is dim because the black hole is spinning. The yellow shows the side of the black hole spinning toward us and the reddish side is spinning away.
Aside from the difficulties associated with seeing something that is perfectly black, another difficulty is their size. Ordinary black holes, which have a mass the few times as big as our Sun, are only about as big as the city of Chicago. Combined with their great distances, they are simply too small to see with modern technology. Seeing the closest known black hole is as difficult as a telescope in New York City seeing a single molecule in Los Angeles. This is well beyond current technical capabilities.
Luckily, the center of nearly all galaxies contain an enormous black hole. For example, the one in the center of our Milky Way galaxy has the mass of about 4 million times that of our sun with a radius about 30 times that of the sun. 
However, the black hole at the center of M87 is truly gigantic. Its mass is about 7 billion times the mass of our sun. And its dimensions are huge as black holes go. It is a sphere with a radius about 130 times that of the Earth's orbit or about three times bigger than the average orbit of Pluto.
That sounds large, but the distance to M87 is so huge that the black hole at the center of that galaxy subtends a tiny angle. It is unbelievably small -- it's equivalent to the width of a line drawn by a sharpened pencil seen from the distance separating New York and Los Angeles, a task that is possible if scientists use an incredibly clever technique that uses the entire Earth as a telescope. And, luckily, the shadow cast by the black hole is about 2.5 times wider than the hole itself.
In 2006, an international consortium of astronomers formed a group called the Event Horizon Telescope. The name is misleading, as their equipment isn't a telescope in the way we ordinarily think of it. Instead, the equipment they use is called a radio telescope, which is just an ultra-sensitive radio antenna. 
And another level of confusion is that the group didn't employ a single antenna. Instead what they did was to tie together a web of radio telescopes spread across the entire planet. The reason they did that is simple. How small an object a telescope can see depends crucially on the size of the telescope. The bigger the telescope, the smaller objects it can resolve.
A world-class radio telescope is only a few hundred feet across. However, by tying together a worldwide network of radio receivers, astronomers can effectively make a telescope the size of the Earth -- essentially a radio telescope about 8,000 miles wide. And by using ultra-precise atomic clocks to synchronize the observations made from around the world, astronomers were able to resolve the shadow of the black hole at the center of the M87galaxy.
Science is all about pushing the limits -- studying what was once impossible to do. And, being perfectly black, tiny and very distant, black holes certainly qualify. Yet black holes are a key laboratory for testing Einstein's theory of relativity, which is our best theory of gravity. Because of this, scientists have indirectly studied them for decades, from observing their effect on nearby stars, to seeing how they heat up giant clouds of gas, to detecting how their motion sends ripples through space and time.
But seeing one directly is a new thing and a huge advance in our ability to understand the behavior of matter under the strongest gravitational forces imaginable. And it's important to note that this work wouldn't be possible without generous support from taxpayers and science funding agencies across the world, including the National Science Foundation here in the United States. (Disclosure: Fermilab colleagues of mine are collaborators on this project and are funded by the US Department of Energy Office of Science.) 
We should all take a bit of pride in our individual role in making possible this breathtaking scientific observation. In the next weeks and months, we're sure to learn even more.","Of all of the crazy sounding things in the pantheon of modern physics, it's hard to beat a black hole.

Nick Douglas,"Gmail and Google Calendar integration is an embarrassment. Gmail can never recognize all the crucial event info, and to fix it, you have to open up Google Calendar in a new tab, defeating the purpose. Thankfully there are third-party fixes, like Pod for Gmail, which recognizes event info and loads it into a full calendar event right inside your Gmail window. Pod’s intro post demonstrates a perfect use case, but Pod for Gmail didn’t always work well for me. It created one event easily, but as soon as I ran more demos to get the screencap above, it started screwing up. Still, Pod loaded up my existing schedule in the right rail, and I was able to enter all the event info while having the email handy. So even in its failure state, Pod makes the transfer from email to calendar less stressful, and less error-prone. The add-on comes from the makers of Pod, a calendar app for iOS.

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres. For some, “new normal” is already passé. Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire, drives from Chico to Sacramento every day.

Customers would get free credit monitoring and other identity protection services once there was ""more clarity around the facts,"" HBC said.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Marina Galperina to Gizmodo","In Philadelphia, people like to recycle. Together, all 1.6 million of us generate about 400 tons of recyclable material each day. But since last fall, roughly half of the bottles and cans my neighbors and I dutifully place curbside in our blue bins every week havent made their way to a sorting facility. Theyve gone to one of two waste-to-energy incinerators, where theyre being burned alongside garbage.
The situation, which everyone from local residents to the company operating the trash-burning power plants seems unhappy about, is a microcosm of a crisis thats been rippling across the country ever since China, once the single-largest buyer for U.S. recyclables, banned the import of two dozen types of foreign waste and imposed strict quality standards on the recyclables itll accept. Nationwide, municipalities are facing higher costs and being forced to find stopgap solutions, from incinerators to landfills, for recyclables that have nowhere else to go. 
Meanwhile, the recycling industrywhich operates with next to no federal guidance despite processing a quarter of Americas wasteis in an existential struggle to chart a new path forward for itself.
Were approaching a point of reckoning that we have had not to debate in the US for a long time, in terms of how we deal with our municipal solid waste and consumer recyclables,Kristina Costa, a senior fellow focused on climate change and energy policy at the Center for American Progress, told me. If as a public policy goal we want to continue encouraging recycling, the time is basically now to have a really serious conversation about what policy changes... need to be put in place.
Most of us think of recycling as a service our city provides, but in reality its a business. There are no national laws governing the industry, which is frequently financed by municipalities. Many cities, like Philly, work with private contractors to collect recyclables and get them sorted and cleaned at material recovery facilities. From there, the paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and aluminum are sold as commodities to various manufacturers.
All told, U.S. recyclers process about 61 million metric tons of material a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Until recently, China was a huge buyer, taking in about 16 million tons of American scrap commodities in 2016, including 60 percent of U.S. waste-paper exports. That all changed last year, when the country started rolling out strict import bans as part of a national campaign to combat pollution. In January 2018, China banned importing 24 foreign materials including mixed paper and post-consumer plastic. Two months later, it tightened its contamination thresholds for recyclable paper products not covered by the ban, including corrugated cardboard, to 0.5 percent. 
The effect on the U.S. recycling business was, as one industry expert put it, like an earthquake. Mixed paper and plastic exports to China plunged more than 90 percent between January 2017 and January 2018, according to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. International Trade Commission. As the industry scrambled to find new buyers, prices went through the floor. Anne Germain, Vice President of Technical and Regulatory Affairs at the National Waste and Recycling Association, an industry trade group, told me that mixed paper went from selling for about $100 a ton to a high of about $3 a ton.
 For products that werent outright banned, Chinas new 0.5 percent contamination standard posed a daunting challenge. Today, the average contamination rate U.S. recyclables sits at around 25 percent. To make their commodities saleable, material recovery facilities started hiring more pickers and buying more equipment to remove items that shouldnt be in the recycling, in addition to slowing down their processing lines.
If you slow down the line, your entire throughput is gonna go down, Germain said. So youre gonna process fewer tons of material. Youre getting less money [and] your costs are going up.
Because they enjoy lower shipping costs, coastal regions were more dependent on China for their recycling, and thats where the impacts of the new policies were felt first. But as New Yorkers and Californians scrambled to find new buyers for bales of plastic scrap and cardboard, including the domestic recyclers favored by middle America, it became a bidding war to get manufacturers to take inventory, Germain said. Eventually, the whole country was impacted.
Ultimately, the effects have rippled back to the cities which, faced with soaring costs to keep recycling afloat, have been forced to make hard choices, whether thats sending recyclables to a landfill or paring down the list of items theyll accept. Phillys situation is at-once unique and quintessential of the problems the entire country faces.
As Scott McGrath, Environmental Planning Director at the City of Philadelphia Streets Department explained, the city was recently making good money selling its recyclables to processors, with the price peaking at $67 a ton in 2012. By January 2018, Philly was paying its contractor, Republic Services, $20 a ton to continue taking recycling. By the summer, that figure had jumped to $40 a ton. When the city started trying to renegotiate its contract, which expired in September, Republic Services asked for $170 a ton to keep recycling.
That was just not doable from a financial standpoint, McGrath told me.
And so, Philly made arrangements to sell half its recyclables to Waste Management for $78 a ton, and to send the other half to waste-to-energy company Covanta, which purchases the citys trash for about $63 a ton, according to McGrath. In October 2018, recyclables started getting mixed in with the solid waste getting trucked to two Covanta-owned incinerators, one in Chester City and another in Plymouth.
The city chose burning recyclables over landfilling because the former produces energy and allows metals to be recovered and recycled, McGrath said. James Reagan, Director of Corporate Communications at Covanta, said the plants systems can be adjusted to accommodate different waste streams and that the change hasnt impacted its ability to keep the two facilities compliant with their air quality permits.
Still, the Reagan acknowledged that the situation is not ideal.
We strongly believe source separated materials should be recycled, he said, noting that the introduction of more plastic and paper to the waste stream means the facilities are processing less waste to generate the same amount energy, which is ultimately bad for business.
McGrath emphasized that incineration is a stop gap measure while we work on a longer term contract, something hes hopeful the city will finalize this spring. Somewhere between March and April well have that contract awarded and get things back to where we were, he said. Where we have a processor handling all the recycling.
But McGrath also pointed to systemic changes that are going to have to happennot just in Philly, but all over the countryfor the industry to fully recover.
One, communities like Philadelphia are going have to generate cleaner material that is more marketable, he said, adding that the city will be focusing more of its efforts on educating residents about what can and cannot be recycled. McGrath said if Philly can convince residents to stop tossing plastic bags in the recycling bin, that alone would be a big deal.
Germain said public education was something the recycling industry as a whole had let slide over the years. We were more about encouraging recycling than saying stop doing this or that, she said. This, combined with the widespread adoption of single stream, has made the public increasingly enthusiastic about throwing everything in their blue bins, resulting in a lot of what Costa calls aspirational recycling, or attempting to recycle garbage.
Once you start saying more and more materials are acceptable, it seems that a lot of people start to think everything is acceptable, Germain said, adding that the increased complexity of packaging today compared with a few decades ago has only added to the confusion.
While a better educated public would translate to a cleaner, more profitable recycling stream, theres also a desperate need for new manufacturers to fill the China-shaped void. McGrath said that beefing up domestic paper recycling would make a huge difference. Encouragingly, thats already starting to happen: Several U.S. and foreign companies, including a few from China, are beginning to purchase and upgrade old paper mills, according to Germain.
Still, it could take years for these facilities to come online, and even when they do its unlikely theyll completely replace the lost markets overseas. Which is why big lesson many sustainability advocates see in the China dilemma is a need to overhaul our throwaway culture.
We need to move toward zero waste, Mike Ewall, the founder and director of the Energy Justice Network, told me. Ewall called out pay-as-you throw schemes, where residents get charged based on how much waste they generate, and curbside composting programs, as important tools for making that happen.
For Philadelphia, waste reduction is going to be a much bigger part of the picture going forward, according to McGrath. Like many other U.S. cities, Philly is now working toward a zero waste future, with a goal of diverting 90 percent of its trash and eliminating litter by 2035. McGrath said that so far, a lot of the citys efforts have been focused on the litter reduction part of the equation, but he expects to see waste elimination efforts ramp up soon. 
Recycling wont go away. But cities are facing a very real possibility that it may not be a profitable venture again for a long time. McGrath said he couldnt see Philly making money recycling anytime in the near future although hes hopeful that some of the most volatile prices, like that of paper, stabilize in the a year or two.

Morgan Sung,"When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin. The bears, along with a young mountain lion with less severe burns, were treated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife after the Thomas Fire burned through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The wildfires that swept through California in late 2017 were the worst in the state's history. The Thomas Fire was the largest ever recorded, burning through 273,400 acres. According to a statement by the CDFW, the bears' injuries were severe, with ""oozing wounds, and, in some cases, paw pads that were completely burned off."" SEE ALSO: Californians band together to save horses from wildfires Deana Clifford, senior wildlife veterinarian at the CDFW, and Jamie Peyton, chief of integrative medicine at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis treated the animals by using fresh tilapia skin instead of traditional bandages. Peyton sutured tilapia skin directly onto the bears' paws. Image: California department of fish and wildlife They opted to use fish skin because its collagen levels and moisture retention abilities are similar to human skin. Researchers in Brazil have used fish skin, in favor of human skin grafts, to bandage burn victims, but the practice hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans in the United States. After applying a homemade salve to speed up healing, Peyton and Clifford cut grafts of sterilized tilapia skin and sutured them directly onto the animals' paws while they were under anesthesia. To prevent them from eating the fish skin, they wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper. (The mountain lion ended up eating his, anyway.) SEE ALSO: How to help victims of the Southern California wildfires “One of the first things that the bear did was stand up after we applied them,” Peyton said in a statement released by UC Davis. “She was more mobile, which in my mind is a huge success for pain control.” Veterinarians wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper to prevent them from eating the fish skin grafts. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Although the animals received three treatments over the course of a month, Peyton told Mashable that the path to recovery was ""fraught with more challenges."" Unlike with treating domestic pets, it wasn't possible to clean, care, and bandage wounds on a daily basis. She said it was also more difficult to manage their pain with medications, and that they had to deal with ""a time crunch to get them back to the wild as soon as possible."" ""Despite these challenges our therapies helped these animals recover faster than we have noted in some companion animals,"" Peyton said, ""The use of the tilapia skin bandages made a remarkable difference in their pain control and healing ability."" The bears also received acupuncture, which has been administered to pets for years. Peyton said the treatment was similar to that given to dogs and cats. ""The principles of pain management and wound healing are similar across many species,"" she said. One of the bears shortly before she was released back into the wild. Image: California department of fish and wildlife To complicate recovery even more, the doctors discovered that one of the bears was pregnant during a routine ultrasound. “That was a game changer for us, because we knew it wouldn’t be ideal for her to give birth in confinement,” Clifford said in CDFW's statement. “We aren’t really set up to have a birth at the lab holding facilities, and we knew there was a high probability that she could reject the cub, due to all the stress she was under. We needed to get her back into the wild as quickly as possible.” The CDFW team built winter dens so the bears could wake up in safety. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Since the bears' natural habitats were destroyed during the fire, officials from the CDFW built winter dens for each of the animals to sleep in and be protected from danger. The team released them into the wild on Wednesday and plan on monitoring the rest of their recovery via satellite. Peyton doesn't see fish skin becoming a standard treatment for human burn victims in the United States because there are multiple skin graft banks that have the resources to treat patients. However, she does believe there may be more demand for alternatives like tilapia skin in countries with fewer banks and less readily available resources. ""I think we definitely need more research in this area to determine if it will be used more extensively in people,"" Peyton said. ""Based on what we have seen in these animals, there is potential for this to be a more commonly used therapy in the future.""","When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin.

Catie Keck,"A pair of dueling Fyre Festival documentariesone on Hulu and one on Netflixare giving viewers a better idea of how a festival-turned-shitshow managed to so badly botch its spectacular promise of being one of the greatest events the world had ever known. While countless people were burned by the scam, Maryann Rolles story was one that stayed with viewers. Now, a GoFundMe campaign trying to help right a wrong has raised more than $150,000.
Rolle, the owner of a restaurant at the Exuma Point Resort in the Bahamas, discusses her ordeal in Netflixs FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened. Rolle said she had a team of 10 people working for her around the clockall day and nightmaking food to feed everyone working on the project. After the festival stiffed her, she says that she lost $50,000 of her own money. She now doesnt even like to talk about the Fyre Festival because of the pain its caused her.

Just seven days after its initial launch, the campaign with an original goal of $123,000 had by Monday evening raised more than $152,000 through nearly 5,000 donations.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Californias 2018 is officially the worst year for wildfires in recorded state history, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday, citing the National Interagency Coordination Centers year-end statistical analysis. The 1.8 million acres of California land that burned last year was more than any other state in 2018, and it far surpassed 2017's tally of 1.3 million acres in California. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean confirmed to the Times that the wildfires were unprecedented.
The Times wrote:
More than 100 people were killed and 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed in a state where fires are considered one of the annual seasons. Crews responded to more than 8,000 fires last year.
Its a surprise its that amount, but in a sense because of what Ive seen over the last year, no its not, McLean said. Its what weve been living through.
... Firefighters said the most devastating blazes had the most extreme behaviorwind-driven ember storms that created spot fires far beyond defensive lines and, in the case of the Carr fire, a fire tornado that ignited objects lifted into the air.
Many of the recorded deaths happened during the Camp Fire, which rampaged across Butte County and killed some 86 people, mainly as it rolled through the town of Paradise and burned most of it to the ground. The Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, both in November, burned more than 250,000 acres alone, the Times noted.
After a seven-year drought from 2010 to 2017, much of California remains a tinderbox with estimates that there are over 147 million dead trees throughout the state. The end of the drought poses its own problems, as fast-growing grasses and other small plants can dry out and catch flame themselves, carrying blazes right to other sources of fuel. Californias rapidly growing population (which has almost doubled since the 1970s) has also brought many more communities into areas at high risk of fires.
Recent research has also indicated that the historical distinction between the December-February wet season and the fire season has largely disappeared, in part due to climate change.
Last year, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told the AP that the state government should consider a ban on building homes in potentially fire-prone areas, saying: Firefighters are living climate change, its staring them in the face everyday. He added that officials owe it to residents and emergency personnel alike to make such decisions, so that they dont have to keep going through what were going through.
California fire officials are planning a major effort to thin forests throughout the state in an effort to stave off future wildfires, but per the San Francisco Chronicle, some experts are questioning whether it will really be enough. Thinning forests reduces available fuel but can also dry out the forest floor or promote growth of less fire-resistant plants, the paper wrote. Denser forests may burn longer, but they may also burn less intensely.
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, Its not fair to say that fuel treatments wont do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you cant just do this and (expect to) make much headway.
McLean told the paper the efforts may not stop the catastrophic scale of wildfires in recent years, but It gives the folks in those areas time to evacuate and it also give the firefighters a chance to get in there and mitigate the fire.
According to the LA Times, fire officials are bracing for the worst. McLean said that the recent wet winter has promoted even more growth in fuel, saying that its fire management programs have to continue forever. Its an ongoing process from here on out.

Andrew Liszewski,"There’s no better example of the war between form and function than smartwatch design. There are boxy, bulging, touchscreen wearables that do almost everything your smartphone can, and there are sleeker analog alternatives that maybe keep track of how many calories you’ve burned. With the latest version of the Vívomove HR, Garmin has tried, and mostly succeeded, in balancing both approaches, creating a smartwatch that hides a respectable list of features behind a traditional analog face. Vívomove HR WHAT IS IT? A hybrid smartwatch that can hide all of its smarts when you just want a watch. PRICE $200 for the silicon &amp; plastic model $300 for leather &amp; steel LIKE Lightweight, minimal design that still manages to include a lot of smart features. NO LIKE Proprietary charging cables need to be eliminated. Garmin describes its newest Vívomove HR as a ‘hybrid’ smartwatch, which is a term often used to describe something that’s been assembled from different parts to create a final product that’s the best of all its sources. But when it comes to gadgets, ‘hybrid’ also usually means you’re going to have to live with some compromises, and that’s certainly the case here. Available in a $200 black or rose gold version with a silicon strap and plastic housing, or a $300 gold or silver version with a leather strap and steel housing, the Vívomove HR looks like a classic analog watch, with a clean numberless face, hour and minute hands, and a distinct lack of any buttons or crown. Garmin has positioned the Vívomove HR as a sports and fitness tracker so part of its design allows it to be worn in the rain, shower, or while sweating during a workout. Yet it can also easily pass as a formal timepiece for work or special occasions. But no one’s going to mistake the Vívomove HR for a Rolex, and the use of a plastic cover over its face (instead of durable glass) is disappointing as the watch is going to inevitably get scratched up. Even the $200 base model is still going to be an investment for some users, and I would have liked to have seen more durable materials used. However, the use of plastics does result in a thin, lightweight, and very comfortable timepiece that’s part of Garmin’s efforts to camouflage the Vívomove HR’s smarts. In fact, most of the time while you’re wearing it, the smartwatch looks nothing like a smartwatch. It’s only when you raise your wrist to look at the time that a hidden black and white LCD display is revealed on the lower half of the Vívomove HR’s face. The watch’s hidden display is as basic as it gets. The resolution is abysmal, and the poor contrast makes it hard to see in bright sunlight. It’s the Vívomove HR’s least impressive feature, but as a way to deliver basic information, it definitely gets the job done, and without requiring you to charge the smartwatch every single night. Garmin promises about four or five days of heavy use between charges, or up to two weeks of battery life when you disable all the watch’s smart features. That’s a definite plus because Garmin has unfortunately chosen to go with a proprietary, clip-on charging cable that you’re inevitably going to forget to bring when you travel. The Vívomove HR’s home screen—which can be customized via an accompanying app to show various types of info like a digital version of the time and date, the weather, fitness metrics, or even music playback controls—automatically turns off a few seconds after you raise your wrist or tap the screen. But if you swipe across it while it’s on, the watch’s hour and minute hands will move out of the way to give you access to the Vívomove HR’s additional features. If you’re in a quiet place, however, I should note that the grinding sound of the motor moving the watch’s hands can be curiously loud The Vívomove HR features all of the stat-tracking capabilities you’ll find in the company’s dedicated fitness trackers, including an optical heart rate monitor that I’ve found to give the same readings as the Apple Watch’s, and metrics derived from a built-in motion sensor like steps taken, stairs climbed, calories burned, and distance covered. Garmin also claims to be able to measure the wearer’s stress by keeping tabs on heart rate fluctuations, and the smartwatch’s software can automatically detect repetitive arm motions and track swimming, cycling, and other activities. I’ve long been a fan of the functionality and features Garmin packs into its fitness trackers, it’s the brand I still recommend to people, and the latest version of the Vívomove HR has all the bells and whistles most amateur athletes could want. As a smartwatch, however, it’s the basics only. The watch mirrors the notifications you get on your smartphone—texts, emails, incoming calls—but that’s about it. You only get to see a small snippet of long messages thanks to the Vívomove HR’s small screen, and there’s no way to reply from your wrist. You are able to use the watch as a remote for whatever music your smartphone is playing, but apps and other more advanced smartwatch features are nowhere to be found here. Is the Vívomove HR an Apple Watch-killer? No, but it doesn’t claim to be. This isn’t a smartwatch for the smartphone-obsessed who want every last feature of their mobile device accessible from their wrist. It delivers the smartwatch basics, alongside a very solid set of fitness-tracking features, including a heart rate monitor. Where it might nibble away at the Apple Watch’s market share is with users who don’t want a shiny glass square strapped to their wrist, but who prefer the look of a more traditional watch. Garmin has managed to upgrade the original Vívomove HR, a clunky fitness tracking bracelet, into a wearable that will let you hide your need to always be connected. README The first smartwatch with a decent set of fitness tracking and connected features that can hide all its smarts. A solid wearable option if you don’t want to have to switch between a fitness tracker and something more dressy. I’m never a fan of having to use proprietary charging cables. The watch’s plastic cover is easy to scratch. The watch’s basic black and white screen limits how much info it can show, and it’s not great in bright sunlight. Garmin’s basic operating system doesn’t give you access to any popular smartwatch apps. The motor that moves the hour and minute hands out of the way can be quite loud at times.","There’s no better example of the war between form and function than smartwatch design.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Bryan Menegus,"The Grey Lady has pulled some reprehensible stunts over the years, including writing puff pieces on neo-Nazis, helping lead the United States into a deadly war in the Middle East, and even employing Bret Stevens. But today it finally burned its most dedicated customers: those of us who pay the paper of record $6.99 a month to play its once-vaunted crossword on our phones. Each day, the Times crossword app provides digital subscribers with a “Mini,” a small puzzle usually solved in under a minute that serves as a sort of pre-crossword snack. Today’s Mini, however, abandoned the traditional parameters of what a crossword even is, to the grave disappointment of myself and about a dozen other people on Twitter. Is that a lot? No. It’s actually very, very few people. But it’s about the principle of the thing. Solve this quick: “Easy as ___.” Pie, right? A pretty simple fill-in-the-blank question with a common idiomatic answer, especially given that, for over 75 years, the answers to the New York Times crossword have almost all been composed of letters, or at the very least a series of letters. Well, take your expectations and throw them down a hole: The answer is “123.” As in numbers. As in math. As in, “Hey, I thought I was playing a goddamn cross word, not a KenKen or Sudoku or doing my taxes for fun.” The answer branches down to the solutions “1am,” “2pac,” and “3hole”—as in “a three-hole punch”—a phrase no one in the world writes that way! One of the Times ’ Twitter accounts even made light of the ire this clue had inspired, seemingly blaming today’s date, 1/23, though the clue had nothing to do with that. You must feel very clever, Tuesday Mini. Rebellious. Superior, even. Amid the terrifying flood of near-apocalyptic notifications rumbling across my phone each day, the Times crossword has served as a place of safety installed on that very same phone. During commutes, it’s been a distraction from the unfixed, century-old infrastructure around my subway car, as well as the plutocrats who sucked the public coffers dry. Mostly, it was a bond of trust. And today, that trust was broken—for both myself and something in the neighborhood of 12 other people. C’mon, New York Times.

Lance Whitney,"However you get your workouts in, you might eventually reach a point where you want to keep track of them so you know how many calories you burn, what distances you travel, and what heart rate you hit while exercising. All of which is very easy to keep tabs on if you own an Apple Watch. You can track your workouts with other devices, of course. Dedicated activity trackers such as those from Fitbit and Garmin, as well as smartwatches from the likes of Samsung and LG can monitor your fitness routines. If you own an Android phone, an Android Wear watch may be your best bet as it can team up with your watch to store and display your workout data. But if you own an iPhone, an Apple Watch is a natural partner as it sends your data directly to the Activity and Health apps on your phone where you can review the information and keep track of your progress. It turns out a bunch of you did get Fitbits last year—or even longer ago—and have managed to keep… Read more Read Through your watch, you can view and record stats for different workouts, such as running, cycling, elliptical, rowing, and swimming (the Apple Watch Series 2 and 3 can withstand water during a swim ; alas, the Series 1 cannot). You can discover your heart rate, calories, distance, and elapsed time during and after each exercise. Then, through your iPhone, you can review the historical data on your workouts. Here’s how to make the most of your new gadget: The initial set-up To kick things off, update your Apple Watch to watchOS 4.0 or higher if you haven’t already done so. Make sure you’re already running iOS 11 or higher on your iPhone. On your phone, open the Watch app. Tap on General and then Software Update. If the Watch app says you have watchOS 4.0 or higher, you’re in business. If not, let the update download and get installed on your watch. Now it’s time to hop on board your favorite fitness machine, or get ready for a healthy walk or jog. On your watch, tap on the icon for the Workout app (the one with the running figure). Swipe down the screen until you find the workout you’re about to undertake. The Apple Watch offers workouts for indoor and outdoor walks, indoor and outdoor runs, indoor and outdoor cycling, elliptical, rower, stair stepper, swimming, and high-intensity interval training. If you don’t see your favorite workout listed, you can choose the entry for Other, which calculates your heart rate and calories burned based on your physical exertion. After you’re done, you can give that workout a specific name to use it again in the future. If you want to track any workout without setting a specific goal, just tap on the name of the workout. If you want to set a goal for a certain number of calories, time, or distance, tap on the icon with the three green circles, select the goal, set the number you wish, and then tap on Start. From there, begin your workout of choice, and your watch will count down and start tracking. If you glance at your watch as you work out, you’ll notice that it displays such metrics as the elapsed time, active calories (calories burned through exercise), total calories (active calories burned plus the calories your body normally consumes), and your heart rate. If you set a goal, the watch will alert you when you’ve achieved it. When you’re done with the workout, swipe your watch screen to the right and tap on the End button. The Workout app then displays a screen showing the stats for your entire workout. Swipe down the screen to view the numbers for the metrics recorded, including total time, calories burned, average heart rate, and the range for your heart rate. Tap on Done to record the workout. Extra features that’ll keep you motivated Those are the basics, but you can do more than just manually kick off and record each workout. Want to exercise with a more hands-off approach? Ask Siri to start a workout. Say: “Hey Siri, start outdoor walk,” or “Hey Siri, start a 10-minute indoor walk,” or “Hey Siri, start a 90-calorie elliptical.” Siri begins the workout. When you’re done, just tell Siri to stop the specific workout. A few other options that you can tweak to suit your preferences: You can track back-to-back workouts and get a comprehensive summary at the end. Start your first workout. Before you finish, swipe your watch screen to the right. Tap on the New button. Start your second workout. Before you’re done, swipe to the right again, tap on New, and start your third workout. Continue this process until you’ve completed all your workouts. When you’re done, stop the recording of your last workout. Your watch then displays the stats for each workout as well as for all your workouts collectively. Need motivation to encourage you to work out? Your Apple Watch offers a smart coaching feature, as well. This feature displays workout advice and suggestions, presents monthly challenges, congratulates you on your achievements, and awards you virtual trophies when you’ve hit your activity goals. Music can be another motivator. You can set your watch to automatically tune up your favorite playlist when you work out. On your iPhone, open the Apple Watch app. Tap on the My Watch tab at the bottom of the screen. Swipe down to and tap on the Workout app. Tap on the entry for Workout Playlist and choose a specific playlist. That playlist will now automatically start when you begin a workout. Remember that you’ll need a Bluetooth headset or speaker to listen to your music. Tracking your data Now let’s say you want to see the data for your recent workout. On your watch, tap on the Activity icon (the one with the concentric colored rings in a circle). The app shows you your activity for the current day in the form of rings around the circle as well as individual charts. The red Move chart displays the calories you’ve burned since the start of the day. The green Exercise chart indicates the amount of time you’ve spent exercising so far. And the blue Stand chart points to the number of hours you’ve spent standing today. The app reveals the number you’ve achieved for each of these three items as well as your goal, or target, number, which the Apple Watch automatically sets based on your daily average for each activity. The objective is to close the ring on each activity, which means you’ve met or surpassed your goal. iOS/Android: If you didn’t sleep well last night, you’ll be tired today. Duh, right? Wake Mode… Read more Read Beyond workouts, as long as the watch is on your wrist, the app is continually monitoring your physical activity and exertion, much like a Fitbit. So if you take a walk, go for a swim, ride a bike, or row a boat, the app will automatically record your activity and add that to your stats even if you don’t trigger a specific workout. To view a recent history of your physical activity, press down on the screen of the Activity app on your watch. Tap on the icon for Weekly Summary and you’ll see how you’ve fared for the week so far. But you can travel back in time much further. Move over to your iPhone and open the Activity app. The app shows you your activity for the current day. Swipe to the right to go back to each previous day where you can see all the data for each day’s activities and workouts. Swipe further down the screen to see the workouts you’ve performed that day. Tap on a specific workout to see all its data, including calories burned, distance, time, heart rate, and pace. You can travel as far back as you’ve been using your watch for workouts as well as general physical activity. Too much data? You can filter the information to display only a specific workout. In the Activity app on your phone, tap on the Workouts icon at the bottom of the screen. Tap on the link for All Workouts in the upper right and change the setting to a specific workout, such as Rowing, Elliptical, or Running. You can now swipe down and then to the right to view the historical stats for just that workout. Customizing your data collection To customize the metrics recorded on an AppleWatch during your workout, first open the Watch app on your iPhone. At the My Watch screen, tap on the Workout app and then tap on Workout View. Tap on a specific type of workout, such as Outdoor Walk, Indoor Run, or Pool Swim. Then tap on Edit. You can now remove any existing metric, such as duration or distance, and add a different metric, such as average pace or total calories. You can record as many as five metrics for each workout. One more option to keep in mind: you can change the daily goal for the Move ring if you want to burn more (or fewer) calories. Press down on the screen of the Activity app on your watch. Tap on the icon to Change Move Goal. Tap on the + sign to increase the number of calories or the – sign to decrease them. Tap Update. Incorporating the Health app On your iPhone, the Health app can also provide insight into your workouts. Tap on the Health app to open it. The Today screen shows you how much exercise and activity you’ve achieved for the day but with a greater breakdown than you’ll find in the Activity app. View your active energy (the calories you burn during activity), resting energy (the number of calories you burn while at rest), the number of steps you’ve taken, the distance you’ve traveled both walking and running, the number of hours you’ve been standing, the number of floors you’ve climbed, the number of minutes you’ve spent exercising, and the number of minutes you’ve spent with your specific workouts. The Health app also displays data on your heart rate, including your average rate, resting rate, and walking rate. As in the Activity app, you can swipe to the right in the Health app to go back in time to see stats for each previous day. Tap on a specific item, such as active energy, steps, or stand hours, to view your average numbers for the day, week, month, or year. Finally, you can also track your workouts and activity through a host of third-party apps available for your Apple Watch. Such apps as Nike+ Run Club, Strava, Runkeeper, Gymatic Workout Tracker, and Workouts++ can monitor and record your fitness routines. The information captured by these third-party apps is also sent to the Activity app and the Health app (with your permission). You can always try these and other apps to see if you like them. But if you want your watch to start tracking your fitness right out of the box, the built-in Workout app is a free, easy, and effective option.","However you get your workouts in, you might eventually reach a point where you want to keep track of them so you know how many calories you burn, what distances you travel, and what heart rate you hit while exercising.

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper,"There's finally a show for those of us who are walking, talking Pinterest Fails, can't get enough of the Cake Wrecks blog, and favor the Reddit subreddit "" Expectation vs. Reality."" Before you bake up your next attempt at a kid-demanded ""Frozen"" or ""Minecraft"" birthday cake, settle down with your Netflix streaming account and watch a few episodes of "" Nailed It,"" released Friday. The new 30-minute show features home bakers who have more confidence than oven artistry. A not-so-royal Rapunzel (we think?), at right, and its inspiration from ""Nailed It."" Netflix Netflix describes ""Nailed It"" as ""a baking competition show for anyone who has tried to copy a Pinterest recipe and epically failed."" So... all of us, then? The premise is simple. Three home bakers are shown a professionally made baked good, from cake pops to wedding cakes, and told to copy it. Ha ha ha boo hoo hoo. For those of us no-craft-talent tools out there, this is a lot like being handed a piano and Mozart's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"" and told to crank out a fresh version. Or taking a piece of marble and a postcard of Michelangelo's ""David"" and being expected to carve a doppelgänger. Paint the Sistine Chapel? Write a novel like James Joyce's ""Ulysses""? Sure, Netflix, I'll get right on that. I'm embarrassed (proud?) to say my own Pinterest-copying attempts look even worse than what the contestants come up with. I haven't seen all six episodes yet, but so far, the ""Nailed It"" contestants are way braver and have more faith in themselves than most of us will ever have. Heck, I still panic when I accidentally throw away the box for a cake mix before the creation's out of the oven. I need those directions! Wait, how many minutes until the toothpick comes out clean? That emoji has reason to be crying after a ""Nailed It"" contestant tried to re-create it. Netflix Thankfully, comic host Nicole Byer is no Paul Hollywood from ""The Great British Bake-Off."" She's not channeling the Julia Child of impressive beef bourguignon, but the Julia who dropped a potato pancake and scooped it back into the pan. And the contestants, at least the ones I've seen, aren't too full of themselves. In the first episode, Elena Timman, a social media coordinator at Tinder, perused her recipe for cake pops and announced, ""I need balls, sticks, crap."" That's exactly how I feel when poring over a new recipe: Where's the crap for this, and how do I put it all together? The show reaffirms what I've always believed about baking. The process itself isn't hard, if you are exacting about your measurements. Don't try any of that throw-this-in, shake-in-some-of-that rebelliousness cooking requires. The baking gods only smile on rule-followers. Your cake or pie or whatever can taste fabulous if you follow the recipe dutifully. But if you don't have the soul of an artist, the final work isn't going to look like anything you've ever seen in a bakery. And my artist's soul is still out behind the studio smoking with Jackson Pollock. Tech Culture : From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech.

Jessica Boddy,"Are you always careful to apply sunscreen before a day outdoors, but find yourself getting burned anyway? It might be due to your application technique. Dermatologists say that most people don’t put on a thick enough layer sunscreen, and new research—in which scientists put varying amounts of sunscreen on volunteers’ butts—shows how those thin applications of sunscreen fail to provide the SPF listed on the bottle. Truthfully, it’s hard to really know whether you’ve applied enough sunscreen. The FDA tests SPF on humans at a thickness of 2 milligrams per square centimeter of skin—but in the real world, most people just squirt an unmeasured dollop into their hands and rub it in a thin layer over their skin. For the average face, a quarter-teaspoon of lotion is needed to get the SPF listed on a given sunscreen. Body surface area varies a lot, but the American Academy of Dermatology recommends slathering on one fluid ounce, or a shot glass’ worth, to get the listed SPF. In this new experiment, the researchers are the first to look at how thick and thin sunscreen applications result in different amounts of UV damage to DNA, according to the study published Tuesday in Acta Dermato-Venereology. They found that when applied typically, SPF 50 sunscreen offered just 40 percent of expected protection from sunburn. Thankfully, that reduced protection from both sunburn and also Sun-caused DNA damage is actually pretty adequate if a person is using a high SPF like 50, according to the paper. Which is why using a product that’s only SPF 15 isn’t a good bet. To figure this out, the researchers applied sunscreen layers of varying thicknesses to the “upper buttocks” of 16 fair-skinned people and exposed them to UV light using a specialized lamp. Some people were exposed to UV rays just once, and others were exposed repeatedly for five days to simulate the sunlight one might get on a vacation. The researchers even calibrated some of the UV ray intensity to match what one might experience in Florida, Brazil, or Tenerife. After those exposures, the researchers did tiny punch biopsies of the areas to quantify how much the UV rays had damaged the skin cells’ DNA. To do so, they used chemical analyses to count the number of thymine dimers, or mis-bonded pieces of DNA that are related to the formation of skin cancer. (The researchers chose to use the participants’ butts because its an area of the body seldom exposed to the sun, and it’s also fatty and easy to take a biopsy from.) For unprotected skin, the damage was greatest under repeated exposure, even at low UV ray intensity. But that damage was reduced considerably with even just a thin layer of sunscreen, akin to typical use (0.75 milligrams of sunscreen per square centimeter). With the thickness tested by the FDA, 2.0 milligrams per square centimeter, damage was reduced even more—but not by much. “If you use sunscreen suboptimally, applying it at 40 percent of the thickness it’s tested at, you’re still getting a very good level of protection from DNA damage,” Antony Young, a dermatologist at King’s College London and study author, told Gizmodo. But the researchers only tested broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50. Forty percent of SPF 50 would translate to SPF 20—that hovers just above the FDA minimum suggestion of broad spectrum SPF 15. Most dermatologists will suggest at least an SPF 30, especially for fair-skinned people. But with a typical slather of SPF 30, you’d be getting the protection an SPF 12 sunscreen. And, more alarmingly, SPF 15 sunscreen would only offer around SPF 6. These numbers are all estimates based on protection from SPF 50 sunscreen in this study, of course, and will most definitely vary in practice. For context, when applied correctly, a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 blocks 93 percent of UVB rays (the UV rays that cause skin burning), according to the American Cancer Society. SPF 30 blocks 97 percent, SPF 50 blocks 98, and SPF 100 blocks 99 percent. The thought that we aren’t getting as much sun protection as we think we are is a very concerning one. The American Cancer Society estimates that 91,270 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States this year, and that over 9,000 of them are expected to be fatal. Rates of melanoma have also been on the rise in the last three decades. Plus, Young said our misapplication of broad-spectrum sunscreen is also putting us at risk for premature aging. That’s because we’re probably blocking fewer UVA rays than we think, which contribute to the breakdown of collagen. Down the line, that can cause saggy skin, wrinkles, and spots. To avoid these things, Young has a few tips. The first is to apply sunscreen twice. Do the first layer, wait 10 or 15 minutes, and then do another thorough layer just like the first—using this strategy might help more people reach the right thickness of application, he said. Secondly, Young urges people to purchase sunscreen products with a higher SPF, like 50, to combat the protection being lost from thin application. And of course, you’ve got to reapply sunscreen every two hours, or after swimming or toweling off. But no sunscreen can fully protect you from DNA damage from the sun, which is why dermatologists recommend you also seek shade and wear protective clothing, including a hat. “Even with sunscreen, we see some genetic changes,” Steven Feldman, a dermatologist at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was not involved with the recent study, told Gizmodo. “Wearing a big floppy hat or a protective shirt might not be such a bad thing, either.” [ Acta Dermato-Venereology ]","Are you always careful to apply sunscreen before a day outdoors, but find yourself getting burned anyway?

The Delta Fire has already scorched 22,000 acres (8,903 hectares) since it began on Wednesday in a Shasta-Trinity National Forest canyon along the Sacramento River, about 250 miles (402 km) north of San Francisco, the California Interagency Incident Management Team said in an advisory. As of Thursday, firefighters had been unable to contain the blaze, said Brandon Vaccaro, a spokesman for the Delta fire command team, but a gradual rise in humidity is forecast, which could help slow the fire’s growth. A stretch of Interstate 5 remained closed on Friday after the fire came near the highway. Motorists were forced to flee on foot on Wednesday before flames engulfed their cars and trucks, local media reported and fire officials said. The fire was threatening about 150 homes and other buildings in the sparsely populated region. About 300 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, Vaccaro said on Thursday. Farther north, an evacuation warning was in effect for the town of Dunsmuir, advising some 1,600 residents to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. The blaze was near the site of the Carr fire, which killed eight people and incinerated hundreds of dwellings in and around the town of Redding this summer, becoming one of California’s most destructive wildfires on record. No casualties have been reported from the Delta Fire. The blaze has raged with the same intensity seen in several wildfires in recent months. Fueled by drought-ravaged pine forests thick with dead and dying timber, flames spread quickly, leaping from tree-top to tree-top and hurling showers of embers into more dried-out vegetation. The Delta fire was one of about 15 blazes burning across California this week. Three times more ground has burned in California so far this year than at the same point in 2017, which ranks as one of the most destructive seasons on record.

Marcus Gilmer,"More harrowing footage of the California wildfires shows just how close the fires in the southern part of the state keep creeping to large urban areas. The new video from ABC7 show the Peak Fire burning right up to the edge of a busy Highway 118 in Ventura County, forcing passing motorists to drive in lanes as far from the highway shoulder as possible while firefighters battled the blaze. If there's any good news here, it's that the Peak Fire, which burned 186 acres, has been 100 percent contained according to California Fire officials. But this footage also shows the horrific reality faced by Californians as they try to maintain normalcy even as these deadly fires continue to encroach upon their daily lives. There's a certain terror in the normalization of an event like a helicopter dropping a load of water on a raging fire while regular rush hour traffic creeps by. It's a grim reality driven home by scenes from all around the state, especially the town of Paradise, California, which has been all but wiped out by the Camp Fire, now the deadliest fire in the state's history. While the Peak Fire may have been contained, Southern California is still being burned by both the Woolsey Fire, which has burned over 96,000 acres, and the Hill Fire, which has burned 4,500 acres. And things will likely get worse in the coming days. While the Hill Fire is 90 percent contained as of Tuesday morning, the Woolsey Fire is only 35 percent contained, and the Camp Fire 30 percent contained.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path. The Woolsey fire has reportedly burned more than 70,000 acres and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate. The Camp Fire has since been declared the most destructive in Californias history. Several fire whirls were observed at the sprawling sites of the three wildfires, the Camp Fire in the north and the Hill and Woolsey Fires in the southern part of the state. KTLA, a CW affiliate, reported observing a fire devil near the 101 Freeway on Friday. Laura Anthony of ABC-affiliate KGO-TV also shared footage of a fire whirl near Paradise, a community of 27,000 people that was almost entirely wiped out by the Camp Fire. Another video shared on Instagram captured a fire whirl reportedly situated near Malibu. Fire whirls develop in a similar manner to dust devils and are essentially spinning columns of hot air. They are sometimes referred to as fire tornadoesand some of these incidents have been reported as suchbut according to weather scientists, theres a difference. California experienced what the National Weather Service announced was the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado during the Carr Fire in July, an incident that Clements pointed to as an example of a true fire tornado. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther at the time that documentation of such phenomena is rare, meaning we know relatively little about how and why they form. Fire whirls, by contrast, are more common. Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, described them to Earther as basically wind shear that gets tilted up. The three major fires continued to burn as of Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The Camp Fire had reportedly burned 100,000 acres as of Saturday morning and was 20 percent contained. The Hill Fire was 25 percent contained after burning thousands of acres. The Woolsey Fire, however, was still not contained as of Saturday.","Several people are dead and thousands of homes and other properties destroyed after wildfires descended on California this week, burning both sides of the state and laying waste to everything in their path.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Strong winds that have powered the third-largest wildfire in California’s history were expected on Sunday to further fuel a blaze that has burned 267,500 acres. Nearly 8,500 firefighters are battling the so-called Thomas Fire in Southern California, which began Dec. 4 and has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 more, including homes in the wealthy town of Montecito just outside the coastal city of Santa Barbara. While the winds were expected to ease on Sunday near Santa Barbara, northeast wind gusts up to 55 mph were forecast through Sunday for parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, National Weather Service forecasters said. The blaze, centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has forced evacuations that turned neighborhoods into ghost towns and filled the air with smoke. The fire is now 40 percent contained despite hot Santa Ana winds that have powered its expansion, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank. Firefighters were employing more than 970 fire engines and 34 helicopters to battle the blaze. Firefighters keep watch on the Thomas wildfire in the hills and canyons outside Montecito, California, U.S., December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Gene Blevins “It is a beast,” Santa Barbara County Fire Department Division Chief Martin Johnson told a news conference on Saturday. “But we will kill it.” Five of 20 most destructive fires in recorded history ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. The Thomas fire, the seventh-most destructive in state history, forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. It was also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California. On Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for parts of Santa Barbara County as high winds whipped the fire through bone-dry terrain. In Montecito on Saturday, smoke billowing from nearby canyons and pushed by the high winds choked the air, hindering aircraft from dropping flame retardant, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. An evacuation order for the city of Ventura was lifted on Saturday morning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. The blaze’s first fatality, he died of smoke inhalation and burns, the Ventura County Medical Examiner’s office said.

Tasha Robinson,"One of the most buzzed-about films at the 2018 Sundance film festival was Ari Aster’s unsettling writing and directing debut Hereditary, a horror film starring Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff, and Milly Shapiro as a family haunted by their past. Or more accurately, haunted by their creepy dead grandmother. Or more accurately than that, haunted by things that should not be spoiled. Critics nearly universally praised Hereditary as shocking and terrifying, leading to some skeptical backlash from horror fans who felt burned by similar advance praise for films like The Witch and It Comes At Night, two extremely tense horror films in which not a whole lot ultimately happens. Well, now Hereditary has its first trailer, which makes it pretty evident that this film has a lot more grim action than either of those movies. Judge for yourself. The best thing about this trailer is that it’s cleverly misleading in all the right ways, so even if you think you’re being spoiled about a plot point, you’re probably not — which won’t keep you from getting the gist and tone of the movie, but will leave a lot of surprises.

Angus Berwick,"EL JUNQUITO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Local opposition leader Jose Rengel has spent almost five weeks in a cramped detention cell on the outskirts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas, after a single witness accused him of leading a riot that burned down a public building. 
Rengel was arrested together with eight other men on January 24 after the witness - a member of the ruling Socialist Party - told soldiers that the 59-year-old had sacked shops and “completely destroyed” a public transport office using Molotov cocktails, according to a National Guard report filed one day later. 
The detained men, who are described by their families as opposition sympathizers, now face charges of arson, theft, and illegally carrying weapons, which could lead to 10-year jail sentences. The men all deny taking part in the protest, according to statements they gave to a court and their lawyers. 
A visit to the neighborhood of El Junquito, a string of poor settlements atop a ridgeline west of the teeming Venezuelan capital, shows the public transport building still stands. The one-room office, its interior decorated with a portrait of former president Hugo Chavez, is providing services as normal and shows no sign of significant damage. 
The National Guard said in its report that they found no weapons on Rengel. They said they seized two shotguns from two other men, both of whom, via their lawyers, denied having them. In addition, the men’s families and neighbors said none of the men were near the transport office at the time of their arrest, contradicting the National Guard’s report that they were detained during the demonstration just after 7 p.m. 
The men all remain in custody. 
The witness, Jesus Vielma, told Reuters he stood by his testimony and said the men were “a band of criminals.” The lieutenant who wrote the report, Jorge Acevedo, did not respond to Facebook messages and the National Guard did not respond to requests to comment on his behalf. Rengel’s lawyers said he denied all charges. 
The arrest of the nine men here in El Junquito is part of what some civil rights groups estimate at almost 1,100 arrests by President Nicolas Maduro’s government since opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked the constitution and assumed a rival presidency on January 23, with the backing of the United States. 
The government has denied it takes political prisoners or fabricates evidence, and says the crackdown is aimed at clearing out criminals. 
Interviews by Reuters with 20 people in El Junquito, a dozen of whom said they were with the men at the time, plus a review of court records and a National Guard report, contradict the National Guard’s official account that they arrested the men during a violent protest. 
Their families and lawyers told Reuters they believe the men were arbitrarily detained, based on the lack of evidence to support the charges against them. 
Some 120 locals have signed a written petition backing the family’s version of the events. 
The National Guard did not respond to requests to comment about the discrepancies between its report and the witnesses interviewed. The Information Ministry, which handles all media enquiries for the government, did not respond either. 
With Maduro under mounting pressure, the arrests, along with some 40 extrajudicial killings by security forces, have spread fear through poor areas, limiting further demonstrations, local politicians and NGOs say. 
“They’re now going after the little guy,” said Javier Torres, a colleague of Rengel, who is head of the opposition Democratic Action party in El Junquito. “It’s to try to silence the voices of leaders in communities that have protested.”

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
Rengel’s wife said he was preparing dinner for the family when several dozen masked soldiers arrived at the house on motorbikes at 9:30 p.m. 
“When they knocked, my husband opened the door without realizing what he would find,” said his wife, Onoris de Rengel, 59. “The soldiers entered shouting ‘Who is Jose Rengel? Who is Jose Rengel?’ They went to the kitchen and ordered us to the ground. They asked him where were the weapons.” 
The soldiers left with Rengel, who they beat hard enough to bruise his ribs, the family and their lawyer said. Photos of the family home, taken by neighbors and seen by Reuters, appear to show it ransacked after a raid, with furniture overturned and clothes strewn across the floor. 
Venezuelan legal aid group Penal Forum, which is representing other people detained in the area, said the arrests come amid a political crackdown since dozens of countries recognized Guaido as the legitimate head-of-state. Maduro accuses Guaido of leading a U.S.-orchestrated coup to oust him. 
Penal Forum says the 1,069 politically motivated arrests between January 21 and January 31 are the most since it began keeping records almost 18 years ago. Most cases involve planted evidence and invented circumstances to justify detentions, its director, Alfredo Romero, said. 
The government began another crackdown on Saturday when troops at the border blocked humanitarian aid convoys sent by the opposition from Colombia and Brazil. Penal Forum says it has recorded over 60 arrests over the weekend. 
The Information Ministry did not respond to requests to comment about Penal Forum’s accusations. The Supreme Court’s president, Maikel Moreno, said in January that judicial officials carry out “invaluable work with professionalism, ethics and quality.” 
“SCOURGES OF THE AREA” 
Locals in El Junquito said there was a small opposition protest on the evening of January 24, when a few dozen people blocked the main road and burned tires close to the Cacique Tiuna transport office. 
At about 7 p.m., Jorge Acevedo, the young National Guard lieutenant, received a call at his outpost, some 4 km (2.5 miles) away, according to his report. 
The caller, Jesus Vielma, head of a local council for the ruling Socialist Party, told Acevedo that Rengel was leading a riot, the report shows. The National Guard withheld Vielma’s identity in the report, but he confirmed to Reuters he was the witness. 
Acevedo said when he and other soldiers reached the scene, protesters attacked them with petrol bombs and rocks. Acevedo wrote that they arrested Rengel and eight others after cornering them, describing them as “the most violent ones there.” 
An employee at the transport office said she was still there that evening at 7 p.m. and protesters only began throwing projectiles an hour later. She said protesters stole several desks and a petrol bomb was thrown against the building, forcing them to re-paint the walls. 
In a statement given at the National Guard outpost that evening, Vielma said that he saw Rengel carrying a shotgun and identified the detained men as those who sacked the office: “They are the scourges of the area.” 
Vielma, in an interview with Reuters, praised the National Guard for bringing order to the community. “We cannot accept a band of criminals. They have to accept the consequences,” he said. 
During a January 26 hearing at a Caracas court, the prosecutor provided no evidence beyond Vielma’s testimony and the two shotguns he said the National Guard seized, but emphasized the “magnitude of the damage,” court documents show. 
The judge remanded the men in custody for 45 days while the investigation continues. 
CRAMPED CELL 
Some families of the men detained in El Junquito say the men were opposition sympathizers. 
“There were some 40 motor-bikes driving up the road. They stopped us, grabbed him and pulled him onto a bike,” said 19-year-old Yosneilis Calzadilla, the girlfriend of one of the detained men, Jhon Mijares. “They didn’t tell us anything.” 
The nine men are jailed inside a 1 meter by 7 meter cell with dozens more detainees, according to their families, lawyers and court documents. 
Eugenia de Vicuna said she has only been able to see her son, Enmanuel, twice, for six minutes in total, since soldiers shot the 21-year-old student at point-blank range with rubber rounds while he was returning home from shopping that evening. 
The rounds left 20 open wounds on his back which have still not been treated, according to his family and a photo supplied by his lawyer. 
On January 29, a judge, in a written ruling, ordered the National Guard to transfer Vicuna and the other eight men to a hospital. But his family and relatives and lawyers for the other men say they remain in the cell. 
The National Guard and Information Ministry did not respond to requests to comment on why they remain there.

Lizbeth Diaz,"SANTA ROSA DE LIMA, Mexico (Reuters) - Burned-out autos littered empty streets this week in the town where Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador faces a first major test of his ability to take control of territory absorbed by organized crime during years of mounting violence. 
Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday he was winning the battle for hearts and minds against a gang of fuel thieves in the central town of Santa Rosa de Lima, a few miles east of Salamanca, home to one of Mexico’s main oil refineries, and close to a center of the nation’s export-driven auto industry. 
But in the grimy settlement of some 2,800 people where authorities say the eponymous Santa Rosa de Lima gang paid residents to obstruct marines and federal police with blockades and burning vehicles and by informing on their movements, some were less certain the government had the upper hand. 
“It’s very hard for people to change,” said Pedro Mendez, 52, who sells household goods in the town. “The bad guys know how to get to them and that there are people who’ll take money to do their bidding.” 
Others accused security forces of damaging private property and breaking car windows in the raids, while denying they were in cahoots with the gangs. 
Santa Rosa is a microcosm of the lawlessness that permeates large swathes of Mexico where cartels have for years replaced the state as benefactors, providing jobs and handouts in return for residents’ loyalty. 
It lies in Guanajuato state, part of the country’s industrial heartland that was long peaceful and is a major magnet for carmakers such as Volkswagen, General Motors and Toyota, but that suffered a doubling of murders last year, official data shows. 
The effort to capture gang leader Jose Antonio Yepez, known as “El Marro,” or “The Mallet,” and blamed for stealing vast quantities of fuel from the Salamanca refinery, is also a test of the government’s ability to end organized crime’s growing threat to legitimate businesses and ordinary citizens. 
Fuel theft costing billions of dollars a year, along with dwindling output, has weighed heavily on state oil firm Pemex, threatening to damage the government’s creditworthiness. 
This week, ratings agency Moody’s warned that “increasing insecurity, robbery and travel warnings hurt Mexican companies’ top lines.” 
ONLY ONE BOSS 
Lopez Obrador’s determination to reassert the government as the main provider of services in anarchic regions is an early hallmark of his presidency, which began on Dec. 1. 
He set his sights on fuel theft soon after taking office, turning off oil pipelines and risking a public backlash as lines began to form outside gas stations. 
Days after the country’s most famous gangster, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, was convicted in a U.S. court, Lopez Obrador became the first president in decades to visit his home town, cutting the ribbon on a road project. 
This week he addressed the violence in Santa Rosa by again urging Mexicans to reject criminal handouts. 
“If you need work because of a lack of job opportunities, if you need welfare support, you can depend on us,” he said on Tuesday. “We’re the ones who offer you this.” 
His rising popularity in opinion polls suggest Mexicans back the efforts so far. 
“HARD TO CHANGE PEOPLE” 
Eduardo Solis, head of Mexico’s automotive industry lobby, said on Wednesday the situation in Guanajuato was threatening business and had the look of a “crisis.” 
Security has sharply deteriorated in the gangland struggle to control fuel rackets, and at 2,609 last year, murders in Guanajuato were over 10 times higher than a decade earlier, official data show. 
Hundreds of police and armed forces arrived in Santa Rosa on Sunday to restore order and round up members of the gang. 
Yepez has so far evaded detention, though federal forces arrested his sister-in-law, alleged to be his finance chief, along with six others on Tuesday, a security official said. 
By Wednesday, the president was saying Santa Rosa had begun to reject the gang’s largesse, which locals said they heard included payments of 1,000 pesos ($52) or more. The burning blockades and protests vanished on Wednesday. 
Among evidence authorities have found in raids was a wage envelope stamped with what appeared to be a symbol of a mallet, reading: “Relatives should go out to protest when required.” 
Though reluctant to speak of fuel theft, several residents said they had seen El Marro and that the town was peaceful until “outsiders” began to arrive a few years ago. 
Guanajuato’s governor, Diego Sinhue, estimated that around 300 people helped set fire to vehicles, although he defended the town against its infamy as a crime hotbed. 
“I’m afraid to go out. If I leave the house something could happen to me because I can see the government’s angry,” said Estela Mendoza, a 44-year-old grandmother, speaking through a hatch in the door of the modest house she shares with her family and which she said she had not left since Sunday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California. The Monday morning update from CAL FIRE shows that 966 structures have been destroyed, making the Carr Fire the eighth-most destructive wildfire to hit the state. At only 20 percent contained, the fire still poses a risk to 5,012 more structures, according to CAL FIRE, meaning that amount of property lost (and its ranking on the list) could rise, especially as assessment crews are able to access more areas that were hit by the fire. At least six people are dead and more are missing, numbers that could sadly also rise. The majority of the losses have occurred in neighborhoods on the north and western side of Redding, a city of 90,000 located on Interstate 5 about two and a half hours north of Sacramento. The Carr Fire rushed into town on Thursday night, jumping the Sacramento River and continued its rampant growth on the backs of gusty winds and 110-degree-Fahrenheit heat. The fire continued to grow over the weekend, doubling in size from day to day before it slowed down on Sunday night. As of Monday, the fire has burned 98,724 acres. The heat in particular has led to near-record-low vegetation moisture, leaving trees, shrubs, and grassland primed to go up in smoke. Vegetation has burned so intensely that the fire has sparked a vortex of smoke and flames, twisting fire tornadoes, and towering pyrocumulus clouds. Smoke has blanketed much of Northern California, spiking air quality to unhealthy levels. Four of the 10 most destructive fires in state history have occurred in the past year, and eight of them have happened since 2000. Three of them occurred last year alone as part of the conflagration in Wine Country and the Thomas Fire that hit Southern California. This wildfire season has proven to be catastrophic as well. Beyond the Carr Fire, wildfires have burned 410,000 acres, more than double the average for this point in the year, according to statistics compiled by Steven Bowen, a meteorologist at insurance company Aon Benfield. The dangerous Ferguson Fire caused Yosemite Valley to be evacuated as a safety precaution last week. And earlier this month, the County Fire ripped through Yolo County, eating up 1,000 acres of land per hour at its peak as onlookers watched its advance from a casino parking garage. The stories of this fire season and last reflect two troubling realities: climate change is increasing the risk of conditions that lead to explosive fires, and a growing number of people are living at what scientists call the urban-wildland fire interface. It’s a dangerous combination that could further rewrite the record books.",The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California.

"Joe Sutton and Susannah Cullinane, CNN","(CNN) Firefighters are struggling to contain the biggest of six blazes burning in southern California, with the Thomas Fire slipping from 15% containment to 10% Sunday. Covering 230,000 acres, the Thomas Fire is now the fifth largest blaze in modern California history. The fires are collectively burning an area larger than New York City and Boston combined. Gusty winds and dry conditions are not helping the wildfire's spread, and there's no rain in the forecast for at least 10 days. Elevated conditions: The Santa Ana winds are forecast to decrease heading into Tuesday, but could gust between 40-55 mph on Monday before tapering, CNN meteorologist Rachel Aissen says. Ventura County and surrounding areas are under an elevated fire outlook, with temperatures remaining between 78-82 degrees as humidity continues to fall in a range below 10%. Warnings: A Red Flag Warning for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties has been extended through Monday evening, the National Weather Service said. It means that elevated fire weather conditions are expected due to a combination of gusty winds and low humidity. Power cuts: The Thomas Fire is causing intermittent electricity outages in Santa Barbara County. Southern California Electric said that outages and surges could potentially affect up to 85,000 customers, with 2,432 customers without power at 9 p.m. PST Sunday (midnight ET). Evacuations: Some 94,607 people were under mandatory evacuation orders in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties Sunday evening, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN. School closures: The Santa Barbara City Office of Emergency Services said in a tweet that 19 of its 20 school districts would be closed Monday and that all South County School Districts would remain closed through the end of the week. Death toll: The death toll from the Thomas Fire stands at one. Authorities believe Virginia Pesola, 70, of Santa Paula, died in a crash while fleeing the fire, her body was found Wednesday. The six blazes vary in size. Thomas Fire: It had scorched 230,000 acres by Sunday evening, with about 10% of it contained. It started Monday in Ventura County, and has since spread into Santa Barbara County. The fire has surpassed the 1932 Matilija Fire -- which burned 220,000 acres -- to become Ventura County's largest recorded blaze, according to CalFire. It has destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN, with firefighting efforts costing $34 million by Sunday night. Creek Fire: The second-largest blaze ignited Tuesday in neighboring Los Angeles County. It has burned 15,619 acres and is 95% contained. Rye Fire: It broke out Tuesday in Los Angeles County and has burned 6,049 acres. Firefighters are making progress, with 93% of the blaze contained. Lilac Fire: This fast-moving fire has consumed 4,100 acres since it ignited Thursday in San Diego County. Firefighters have regained control of it, and it's 75% contained. Skirball Fire: It started Wednesday as a brush fire in Los Angeles County. It has burned 422 acres and is now 85% contained. Liberty Fire: The blaze in Riverside County has burned 300 acres since it ignited Thursday. It's 100% contained, but authorities are monitoring it ahead of a forecast increase in winds. As California Gov. Jerry Brown surveyed the damage in Ventura County Saturday, he predicted that extreme fire activity would happen on a regular basis for decades. ""With climate change, some scientists are saying that Southern California is literally burning up,"" the governor, who is a n advocate for climate science, said. ""So we have to have the resources to combat the fires and we also have to invest in managing the vegetation and forests... in a place that's getting hotter."" As for those facing the flames of the current wildfires, there's gratitude -- for life, community and the efforts of the firefighters working to protect both. One family whose home was destroyed in the Creek Fire told CNN affiliate KCAL9 News that they had lost everything to the blaze but were grateful to be alive. ""For me, it was like my 15 years of living here was flashing by -- of memories, you know, the gatherings, all that,"" Javier Hernandez told the station. ""And then at the same time, we were like, 'OK, my family's OK. If it's gonna burn, it's gonna burn.'"" A number of celebrities voiced their thanks to firefighters and concern for the communities at risk from fire. Oprah Winfrey and Ellen Degeneres, who both have homes in Montecito, tweeted that they were praying for their communities. ""Our house is under threat of being burned. We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters,"" Degeneres said, adding in a later tweet that she was proud to be part of a community where people were helping each other to safety. Winfrey tweeted that her prayer as the fires raged was ""peace be still."" Retired tennis player Jimmy Connors' said the Thomas Fire was also threatening his home, tweeting his thanks to the firefighters ""working tirelessly."" Firefighters from Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington state are helping to fight the fires. Additionally, the Nevada Department of Corrections and Nevada Division of Forestry -- which run conservation camps for inmates -- have sent six trained crews to help. The crews of minimum security inmates will be fighting the Thomas Fire, the department said in a release. CNN's Faith Karimi, Paul Vercammen, Steve Almasy, Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.","Firefighters are struggling to contain the biggest of six blazes burning in southern California, with the Thomas Fire slipping from 15% containment to 10% Sunday.",2017-12-11T09:11:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",California wildfires now larger than New York City and Boston combined,http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/us/california-wildfires/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171211202727-thomas-fire-monitor-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,burned,1

John Biggs,"Researchers at the have successfully etched edible circuits onto the surface of food, paving the way for RFID tagged edibles that can help us track food from farm to tummy. The project, which uses something called laser-induced graphene (LIG), is a process that creates a “foam made out of tiny cross-linked graphene flakes” that can carry electricity through carbon-rich products like bread, potatoes, and cardboard. “Overall, the process demonstrated that LIG can be burned into paper, cardboard, cloth, coal, potatoes, coconuts, toasted bread and other foods,” wrote the researchers who hail from Rice University’s Smalley-Curl Institute and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The process can embed or burn patterns that could be used as supercapacitors, radio frequency identification (RFID) antennas or biological sensors. Based on these results, the researchers theorized that any substance with a reasonable amount of carbon can be turned into graphene. To test this theory, Tour’s team sought to burn LIG into food, cardboard and several other everyday, carbon-based materials.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / Glory to Rome, as seen in Jeff Lozito's recent unauthorized redesign/printing. reader comments 0 I remember exactly where I was the first time I played Glory to Rome. It was the spring of 2011. I was on a Thalys high-speed train leaving Amsterdam, headed for Cologne, not far from where I was living at the time in Bonn, Germany. My friend Joe brought this new game straight from the US that he’d recently acquired—he was eager to teach it to me on the train ride. Joe, who had a penchant for game nights, roped me into board games by teaching me the classic gateway game Catan. From there, I learned Puerto Rico, Power Grid, and many others. There was a period of time when our circle of friends gathered most Fridays over burritos and beer to play one game or another. But GTR felt different. First, I noticed the packaging. Unlike the high-quality large-format cardboard boxes with soft colors and thoughtful art, GTR came in a compact, cheap, plastic tub that wasn’t much bigger than a large paperback book. Second, and more jarring, was the game's art. It had a bright color palette and cartoonish characters that seemed like they belonged in a children’s clip art computer game. But hey, who was I to argue with Joe? As we settled into our seats and flipped down our tray tables, Joe started unpacking the game and patiently explaining the rules. What immediately struck me was the mechanic allowing the player to choose what type any given card would be—one of a few choices that would automatically exclude the others. GTR appeared to be full of intrigue and strategy, and there were multiple ways to win. Best of all, the game worked very well playing side-by-side on a train ride. Over the course of three hours, Joe promptly defeated me three times. But I kept wanting to play. Later that year, I found out from Joe and some other gamer friends (Hi, Jake!) that there was a new edition being funded through Kickstarter. This Glory To Rome 2.0 promised to dramatically improve the game’s design—better art, less plastic tub. But over time, life got in the way and I forgot about it. By 2012, I’d moved back to California and our gaming circle had mostly dispersed. Even if I wasn't playing regularly, every so often, the thought would occur to me to get a copy of Glory to Rome for a friend as a gift. But time and again, the game seemed to be utterly unavailable. In 2013, I finally learned why when Quartz ran an ominous piece: "" This man lost his house because his Kickstarter was too successful."" It detailed the collapse of Cambridge Games Factory—the team proposing a newly Kickstarted upgrade to Glory To Rome. Wait, what? More than four years later, in August 2017, Kotaku Australia summed up my feelings, calling GTR ""The $360 Board Game You'll Never Play, But Should."" As reporter Haoran Un wrote: I have played it maybe a dozen times, and every time I am both delighted by its intricacies, and so frustrated that I need to play it again. It is also virtually impossible to acquire. The game is long out of print, and may never re-enter print. If a copy is resold, you will almost never find it for less than $300. Some people have certainly considered paying as much as $360 for it. A friend of mine was extremely chuffed to find a French-language copy, and spent several evenings sleeving all the cards and physically cutting and pasting in English text, just so he could have a copy of his very own. In less than a decade, how could a game whose ranking still remains relatively high (150) on Board Game Geek (BGG) —just a few places above Magic: The Gathering and a few places lower than Carcassonne —have totally disappeared? What happened? And, perhaps most importantly, do interested gamers have any chance to get their hands on a copy today? Here's what the game looks like during gameplay. The author's Lozito reprints. There's a lot of cards, but not so many that you couldn't carry them all with you. The dynamic duo The best-suited people to answer my questions were the game’s creators themselves: Carl Chudyk and Ed Carter. Chudyk, who is credited with being GTR’s designer, remains active on BGG. He was quick to respond. ""Hi Cyrus, I do not conduct interviews, in any way, shape, or form,"" he emailed within 24 hours of my inquiry earlier this year. Accordingly, he didn’t respond to any subsequent messages. Carter remained more elusive. I tried sending emails, texts, and Facebook messages and got nowhere. He hasn’t logged into BGG since August 2014. Glory to Rome tasks players with rebuilding the city of Rome after the devastating urban fire of AD 64. The 2-5 player competitive game revolves around a deck of 187 multi-use cards, which players collect and play to rebuild the city’s structures. Each turn, you can either draw cards or play a card for its “role” (laborer, merchant, etc.) and do an associated action. Other players can also play that role if they have a matching card, sort of like the role selection in Puerto Rico, San Juan, and Race for the Galaxy. But these same cards can also function as building materials or the foundations of the buildings themselves, and they can be slotted into the four different sides of your player board to enhance future actions. When cards are discarded, they go to a central pool that every player can draw from. The key to winning is piecing together powerful card combos that make your actions more efficient so you can win the race to one of the game’s end conditions. You also have to make sure to not feed your opponents cards they need through your discards and be careful to choose roles that benefit you more than your opponents. The game is notoriously difficult to wrap your mind around on a first play, but the fun you’ll get out of it makes the trouble worth it. —Aaron Zimmerman Defeated, I went back to poking around on BGG. I quickly realized there are frustrated fans going so far as to reprint their own versions of GTR without the company’s official blessing. This is somewhat similar to fans that have continued to play and produce Star Trek: The Customizable Card Game with the parent company’s tacit approval. One of the best GTR reprints was done by Jeff Lozito, a Toronto-based fan who made his trove of files available via Dropbox in April 2018, several weeks after I first reached out to him. Lozito had done this once before back in 2014, he explained to Ars. This GTR fan had taken the images that Cambridge Games Factory itself put up and painstakingly spent a whole weekend re-typing all the text in Photoshop. His new version was cleaned up with color correction and everything. ""It’s one of those games, you just recognize the genius of the design of it,"" Lozito told Ars. ""This is one of the quintessential big games in a small box. Every time you sit down to play it it plays differently, the cards are all crazy. I looked at the game and I have no idea how his brain could come up with such a complex game out of 125 cards or whatever."" Lozito was quick to underscore that he did not want to profit from the sales of this game. ""This is a game that should be back in print and it’s ridiculous that people who want to play it have to pay dumb aftermarket prices,"" he said. ""Here you go, here’s a solution for anybody who wants it."" His BGG post introducing the remake only reiterated this notion: ""I make no money off of this, nor would I ever dream to. And were the publisher or anyone else associated with the game to ask me to remove the files, I would do so without question or hesitation."" Nearly five months later, no one has.

Frank Jack Daniel,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-oil company Pemex burned through $665 million at its fertilizer unit, ignored consultants and made high-risk investments with no discernible business strategy, according to a devastating government audit of its 2017 operations. 
The report, published late on Wednesday, offers insight into how Pemex ended up creaking under $106 billion of debt during the six-year term of former President Enrique Pena Nieto. 
Mexico’s Federal Audit Office (ASF) used unusually frank language in its assessment of Pemex’s use of public resources, particularly with regard to the company’s fertilizer subsidiary and a failed power generation unit. 
The fertilizer company suffered net losses of $665 million in 2017, and its assets were worth $1.1 billion less over the course of the year. 
“It destroyed value,” read the assessment, the last of three reports by the audit office on the state of government finances in 2017. 
Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to revive Pemex by clamping down on over-spending, rampant fuel-theft and corruption, but ratings agencies and investors are wary that expansive plans to revamp Mexico’s refineries could further weigh on finances. 
Fitch downgraded the company’s credit rating to one notch above junk last month. 
David Colmenares, who has headed the ASF since before last year’s election, told Reuters the results showed Pemex needed to be “re-engineered” to revive its finances. 
“We believe that if we resolve many of these points, we will be able to recover (Pemex’s) finances,” he said. 
He acknowledged corruption in the company, citing examples of contracts given to recently-created companies with no energy experience. 
BAD BUSINESS 
Many of the problems at Pemex Fertilizers, a subsidiary created under Pena Nieto’s liberalization of the energy sector, stem from its purchase of two fertilizer plants in 2013 and 2016, the report said. 
Both plants had previously belonged to Pemex before being privatized in the 1990s by Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
The first plant, ProAgro, was not operational when Pemex bought it back for $475 million. Despite three attempts to revive it, the plant was still not up and running this year, the report said. The second plant, Fertinal, operated well below capacity, the report said. 
Before the purchase, international auditors including PWC, warned Pemex’s board of directors of the parlous state of the two plants, but the company went ahead and bought them anyway, the report said. 
Similarly, Pemex created a new power generation unit, called Pemex Cogeneration and Services, in 2015, without the board of directors being presented any evidence or studies to show it could be a profitable business, or seeing a business or operation strategy, the report said. 
Without any infrastructure to generate electricity, the company lost $19 million in 2017. Pemex closed the unit the following year. 
Wilbur Matthews, founder of Texas-based Vaquero Global Investment, called Pemex’s business decisions during the 2013-18 period “completely incongruous.” 
“The way that they were conducting business in the past six years did not make any sense at all,” Matthews said. 
During Pena Nieto’s term, Pemex took on an additional $47 billion in debt, citing the deterioration in finances and commitments to keep up investment levels at a time when the oil prices collapsed. 
Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt strategies at AllianceBernstein, which has $550 billion of assets under management and owns Pemex bonds, blamed the company’s problems on the federal government charging it too much in taxes. 
“The real issue is that the sovereign has taken a lot of money out of Pemex,” she said. 
Khan said the company’s management had improved in the last years of Pena Nieto’s government. 
“The decision to do energy reform, to reduce the burden of expenditures for the company and to try and stabilize the company were actually good decisions from a management perspective.”

Seventeen days after the fire started, firefighters successfully formed a perimeter around the destructive blaze, Cal Fire officials said. Full containment does not mean that a fire is entirely extinguished, but that firefighters have established a line around it. The authorities have not yet identified the cause of the fire. The Camp Fire burned over 150,000 acres the equivalent of 10 Manhattan islands and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, according to the authorities.

Brian Heater,"It’s been a rough few months for MoviePass. But every time the movie subscription service has faltered, one company has been there to pick up the pieces. Sinemia has done a solid job benefiting from MoviePass’s woes, even seeming to taunt its chief competitor with a handful of promotions. Now that Sinemia is launching an unlimited plan in the U.S., U.K, Canada and Australia, the service is getting a few more digs in. In a press release tied to today’s announcement, Sinemia called the $30 a month plan “a sustainable, reasonable model for seeing movies on an unlimited basis.” “While most of our plans are focused on the modern moviegoer who sees one, two, or three movies each month, we want to serve every type of movie lover and that includes frequent moviegoers looking for an unlimited tickets option,” CEO and founder Rifat Oguz notes in the release. “We’ve spent four years testing and fine-tuning our unlimited tickets model and are confident this is the right price to sustainably offer such a plan.” The references to sustainability and the like are clearly digs at the fact that MoviePass has burned through cash and repeatedly tweaked its own offerings in an attempt achieve profitability.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Rescue teams are continuing to search for survivors in southern California after a series of mudslides killed 17 people and swept away more than 100 homes. Run-off from heavy rain caused devastation in Santa Barbara County, with officials saying mud was waist-deep in some areas. In the upmarket neighbourhood of Montecito, some homes were swept from their foundations. The area is home to a number of celebrities, including actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and TV personality and actor Oprah Winfrey. Parts of the major north-south highway Route 101 were closed in both directions and not expected to reopen until next week. Read more: California mudslides death toll rises In pictures: Mudslides cause chaos 'Like a World War I battlefield' Why did the mudslides happen? Heavy downpours hit ground that had been burned by wildfires that took hold in December. Burned vegetation and charred soil create a repellent layer which prevents this rainwater from being absorbed. Together with the loss of vegetation, this can increase the risk of mudslides and floods. Where was affected? Santa Barbara County has been badly affected, with thousands forced to leave their homes. For many this was the second time in two months after fires ravaged the area last month. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Helicopters have also been transporting people out of the Romero Canyon neighborhood, where about 300 people were cut off after a massive debris flow blocked the road into the area.","Aerial imagery and maps showing the destruction caused by mudslides in southern California, as teams continue to search for survivors.",2018-01-11T14:26:19Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California mudslides: Before and after,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42647131,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A81B/production/_99553034_101_google_976.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,burned,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images ""Heavenly father, please help us."" Sitting in the back seat of the car her husband was driving, Brynn Parrott Chatfield's entire field of vision was filled with flames as she prayed. Only the thin strip of road in front of them remained unburned. Shades of orange, white, purple and pink burst out on both sides, hundreds of small fires all burning at the same time, low on the ground and up and over the trees. ""Please, help us to be safe."" A wave of embers rose up from the surface of the road and struck their front windscreen. Brynn's husband Jeremy drove calmly on down the middle of the road; no-one would be coming towards them into the fire. ""I'm thankful for Jeremy and his willingness to be brave..."" By now, no road was visible, and only a dense orange cloud could be seen in front of the car. Then suddenly, it cleared, and the fires seemed to scatter. Clear skies opened up, the last embers bounced off the windscreen and the fire was finally behind them. As a helicopter flew overhead, carrying water to try and douse the flames, Jeremy and Brynn knew they had made it out alive. Soon after, almost nothing would remain of their hometown, Paradise, and the fire they fled in north-east California would become the deadliest and most destructive in the state's history. This is the story of how the fire spread. Thursday, 8 November 06:15 It is known, simply, as Incident No: 181108-9002. The incident report, logged by the utility company, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, shows that damage occurred at this time in a power line outside the small community of Pulga. This significance of this is not yet clear, but it may prove to be the spark that lit what became known as the Camp Fire. PG&amp;E are co-operating with investigators, and point out that no cause has yet been determined. But the company had warned a day earlier that it may turn off power in the area because of strong winds expected on the Thursday. In the end, it decided not to do so ""as weather conditions did not warrant this safety measure"". A lawsuit has already been filed against PG&amp;E, alleging negligence and health and safety code violations. 06:29 The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) reports that a wildfire has started outside Pulga, about three miles north-east of Paradise. 07:30 Staff at the Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, about 25 miles from Pulga in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, are warned that the Camp Fire is getting close to town and that they should evacuate their patients. One nurse, Tamara Ferguson, is carrying out checks on new mothers in the maternity ward alongside a new trainee. She spots an orange glow out of the window and steps outside with her colleagues. As they look up at the sky, ash starts to fall like snow. She and other hospital staff, including surgical nurse Karen Davis, begin to move the hospital's 67 patients into any vehicle they can find. Image copyright NASA 07:50 Sorrell Bobrink is waking up at home in Paradise when she receives a phone call from a friend. Her friend is in Oroville, some 20 miles from Paradise down in the Sacramento Valley. From her house, she looks up towards Paradise and sees flames, and worries that Sorrell might be in danger there. ""It looked like the sunrise was coming up,"" Sorrell, 39, later tells the BBC. ""But we were far past sunrise. There was this moment of 'Oh that's odd...that's not good.'"" Within eight minutes of the phone call, Sorrell is hosing water on to the roof of her home of two years, before turning on sprinklers. It won't be enough to save her house. Sorrell picks up whatever clothes she can, leaving behind all items of sentimental value: her midwifery books, the notebook her mother put together aged 21. She puts her son, cat and dog in the car and, before leaving, grabs a cup of coffee from her kitchen counter. 08:06 Having made his morning coffee, William Hart steps out of his home in Paradise and notices the darkening grey-brown sky. His first reaction is not that a wildfire is on its way. ""We're in Paradise, in the mountains. Everyone has a chimney here,"" he says later. ""But when we saw black, brown smoke coming, we knew it wasn't chimney smoke."" He finds his bag - still unpacked since he moved into the house six days earlier - and his housemate picks up the urn that carries her late husband's ashes. Image copyright Getty Images 09:26 The sky over Paradise is by now a deep sepia as the smoke starts to blot out the sun. Within 10 minutes, it is as though night has fallen. The only lights are those of the cars trying to make it out of town, but much of the traffic has ground to a halt. Ash falls on Paradise at a rapid rate. ""No, it is not six o'clock or seven o'clock at night, people,"" William Hart says on a video he broadcasts on Facebook. ""I don't even know what the eff time it is."" His is the last car in the queue leaving Paradise as the flames close in. As she tries to leave town, nurse Karen Davis' vehicle breaks down. ""Fire was coming on both sides. It was a fire tornado,"" she later tells CBS. ""All of a sudden, it filled with black smoke."" Karen calls her daughter Wendy, who can hear the sound of heavy items falling on the car, and a crackling noise over the line. ""It's getting really hot. I can't breathe,"" Karen says. ""Well guess what?"" Wendy says, urging her mother to leave. ""I'm not going to be here on this line listening to you die."" Karen steps out of her vehicle, hitches a ride back into Paradise and heads towards her hospital again. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Nearby, another nurse, Tamara Ferguson, is in an ambulance leaving town with a critically ill patient and other staff. Over the radio, they hear that one of the ambulances ahead of them has caught fire. They pull over and realise they can't make it any further, and hear the small blasts of transformers exploding around them. Looking at the only house that is not burning, they decide to shelter with patients inside its garage. Tamara and her colleagues start stripping away loose vegetation from near the house to try and stop it catching fire. Others spray the roof and start stockpiling water as the fire gets closer. The flames grows bigger around them, and cars become caught in gridlock. Tamara calls family members, telling them how she loves them, how sorry she is for mistakes she may have made. She asks her eldest daughters to look after their youngest siblings. When she finally makes contact with her boyfriend, he tries to calm her down and tells her to breathe slowly. ""Babe, there's no way I'm going to survive this,"" she replies. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images 10:37 onwards Sorrell Bobrink, her son, cat and dog are moving north out of Paradise, but the fire creeps ever closer into the road, reducing it from a five-lane highway into one with two lanes, and slowing traffic just as people want to move quicker. Sorrell knows that each decision she makes could be fatal. She knows there is a section in the road up ahead that is not surrounded by trees. But with little around her to help her get her bearings, she doesn't know how close it is. So she fears she may be driving herself and her passengers to their deaths. Instead, she makes it out. So too do the nurses, who return with their patients to the Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, despite the fire getting closer there. Emergency crews carry out triage on the patients who need it, and Tamara Ferguson helps treat two women who had just undergone caesarean sections. As the fire creeps towards them, staff move patients as high as they can, up to the hospital's helipad, which fills with wheelchairs, stretchers and blankets. Eventually, they all manage to drive away to other hospitals in the region, leaving just as the fire starts to consume their own hospital. ""I looked out the back window at the devastation, while I conversed with the sweetest 95-year-old woman,"" Tamara later says. ""We watched the flames beside us, burnt cars in the road, power lines down and fresh homes burning, it went on for miles. ""I honestly couldn't believe I was alive, that I would see my family, kids and boyfriend again."" Image copyright EPA Image copyright Reuters Car tires pop around William Hart as they succumb to the fire. Along the way, he picks up a passenger and two abandoned dogs, who sit on his back seat as he records his journey on his phone. William passes the charred remains of other dogs, and some which he believes are human. He can't look at the footage, and deletes it, then keeps driving for hours once the fire is behind him. At least 63 people were killed, many as they became trapped in their cars as the fire surrounded them. Within only a day and a half of it starting, the Camp Fire destroyed more properties than any other fire in California before it. More on the California fires ""Boys, this is paradise."" Those are the words, according to local legend, that led to the small mill town gaining its name in the 1860s. William Leonard and his crew are said to have just returned from delivering lumber to a mill when he sat down underneath a pine tree, looked out at the view, and spoke those words. Over time, Paradise grew to be a bucolic town of 27,000 residents, known for its cooler temperatures and slower pace of life among the trees. There was the Gold Nugget Museum, that talked of the Native American prospectors who first settled the area. There was the Black Bear Diner, with its all-day breakfasts and friendly sign (""Welcome to Bearadise""). But there were also those pines, the ones that William Leonard sat under in the 1860s, and the ones that played their part in the destruction of the town. Image copyright AFP Conditions in California mean that if a wildfire ignites, it can spread at speed. The state has suffered especially dry weather recently, and California Governor Jerry Brown has acknowledged the role man-made climate change has played in making those conditions worse. This would be bad enough in itself, but the powerful Santa Ana winds - warm, dry air travelling from the east to the coast - have turned vegetation into tinder across the state. Areas like Paradise, which is at the bottom of mountains over which the winds barrel down, are especially at risk. Those winds helped whip up the Camp Fire and led it to jump canyons, roads and emergency fire-breaks that had been dug to try and stop the flames spreading. On the morning the Camp Fire swept through Paradise, there were gusts of up to 55mph. ""It was just so fast,"" Sorrell Bobrink says, still unable to understand how things got so bad, so quickly. Image copyright AFP A map of damaged properties in Paradise shows strange streaks, isolated pockets where the fire flashed by and left little damage. In some neighbourhoods, one house would remain standing while all others around were destroyed. A rubber duck stood untouched even though the house in which it once sat no longer existed. While almost all of the interior of one shop was incinerated, cardboard boxes holding gas grills were left barely burned. Houses that suffered no damage at all are few and far between, however. So far, the Camp Fire has destroyed more than 12,000 properties and 142,000 acres. Ten days on, it continues to burn and it is unlikely to be fully contained until the end of the month. As Paradise was lost, and two other large wildfires spread in southern California this week, Gov Brown said he refused to accept this was the new normal. ""This is the new abnormal,"" he said. But in interviews, Camp Fire survivors would often cite other fires they or relatives had survived in recent times - the Carr Fire, the Thomas Fire, the Tubbs Fire, the Mendocino Complex Fire - each different in its own way, but which together signify a new sort of threat California must learn to live with. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Survivors are now scattered across the state - some in Red Cross camps, some in a temporary tent city that has popped up in the car park of a Walmart that was somehow spared. Meanwhile, relatives of the more than 600 people who are still missing are now being asked to give DNA samples so police can match them to any remains that are found. Police dogs trained in picking up the scent of bodies are being taken through the piles of ash where houses once stood. ""I will forever be changed, as so many thousands of others were,"" Tamara Ferguson says. ""Not by what was physically lost, but by the reminder that life changes quickly.""

Jonathan Shieber,"As crews across California battle more than a dozen wildfires—including the largest in state history—the blazes are spewing enough carbon into theair to undo some of the good done by the state’s climate policies. What’s even worse: Climate-warming compounds that will be released by the charred forests long after the fires are extinguished may do more to warm up the planet than the immediate harm from smoky air. Scientists say that only about 15 percent of a forest’s store of carbon is expelled during burns. The remainder is released slowly over the coming years and decades, as trees decay.That second hit of carbon, experts say, contains compounds that do more to accelerate climate change than those from the original fire. And future fires over previously burned ground could make climate prospects even more bleak. “The worst possible situation is the fire that comes through and kills everything,” said Nic Enstice, regional science coordinator for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. “Then, ten or fifteen years later, another fire comes through and releases all the carbon left in the trees on the ground. That’s really bad.” It’s a scenario that could explode at any time. Enstice cited a research paper published this year that laid out a chilling tableau: California has more than a 120 million dead trees strewn around its mountain ranges, with the southern Sierra hardest hit. When fires hit those downed trees, the state will begin to experience “mass fires” spewing plumes of carbon. The resulting conflagrations, according to the researcher, will be almost unimaginable. “The emissions from those fires will be unlike anything we will have ever seen,” Enstice said. “And you won’t be able put it out.” Computing the carbon released from the the fires so far this year will not happen soon. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flies planes through smoke plumes, gathering data, but air traffic over wildfires is tightly restricted. Scientific research is not a top priority when fires are threatening towns. But some preliminary data is available now. One method uses inventories of existing forests—surveying how many trees and which type. Those records are updated every 10 years. Researchers then overlay infrared images captured from satellites that show what’s burning and at what intensity. From that, predictions can be made about carbon emissions on any given day. Scientists say that emissions from burned forests are one of the most virulent types, called black carbon. According to the most recent accounting from the state Air Resources Board, California’s annual black carbon discharge—excluding wildfires—are equal to emissions from about 8 million passenger vehicles driven for one year. Not a small number. But when the state calculates the same annual average of black carbon coming solely from wildfires, it’s the equivalent of nearly 19 million additional cars on the road. With year-round fire seasons and fire intensity off the charts, state officials admit that wildfires could set backCalifornia’s myriad policies to offset the impacts of climate change. “It’s significant,” Enstice said. “We don’t have a lot of data to measure yet, we’re still using primitive tools. But everyone is gearing up to study this.” This article is republished courtesy of CALMatters.","Julie Cart Contributor Share on Twitter Julie Cart is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who writes for CALmatters, a nonprofit, non-partisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.

Scott Neuman,"Protesters shout slogans as they wave Iraqi and Syrian flags during a protest against the U.S.-led missile attack on Syria, in Tahrir Square, Baghdad, Iraq, on Sunday. Hadi Mizban/AP Demonstrators gathered in major cities across Iraq on Sunday to protest U.S.-led airstrikes against Syria in protests called for by Muqtada Sadr, the influential Shiite cleric who led the Mehdi Army that fought U.S. forces after the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. The demonstrations took place in Baghdad, Basra and Najaf. Protesters ""raised Iraqi and Syrian flag in solidarity with Syrian people. They also chanted against the U.S. and its allies,"" according to Iraqi News. U.S. and Israeli flags were also burned by protesters. Iraq's foreign ministry also warned that the strikes against Syria marked ""a very dangerous development."" ""Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,"" the ministry said in a statement quoted by Al Jazeera. Regionally, at the Arab League summit over the weekend, the strikes were discussed and Iraq was one of the few countries to condemn them. The airstrikes in Syria underscore apprehensions in Iraq that the U.S. could be stumbling into a wider war in the same way it lost control of events in Iraq. As we reported earlier this month, since disbanding the Mehdi Army, Sadr emerged as an Iraqi nationalist. He has reached out to Saudi Arabia — which is gradually warming up to Iraq after a decade of hostility to the country's Shiite-led government — to try to lessen Iraq's isolation in the Arab Gulf countries.",Slogans were shouted and American and Israeli flags burned in protests in three major Iraqi cities following a call from a former leader of an anti-U.S. militia.,2018-04-16T11:09:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Iraqis Protest U.S.-Led Airstrikes Against Syria,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/16/602781524/iraqis-protest-u-s-led-airstrikes-against-syria,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/16/ap_18105564179941_wide-4eaf104096d0cda04afc6c3e0b9f2af3caaf8fe7.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,burned,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The pictures from the ground of the Carr Fire showed devastation on a human scale. But new aerial imagery released by the city of Redding puts the massive wildfire in a landscape context, revealing the both the power and capriciousness of one the most destructive fires in California history. Firefighters and sheriffs used drones to better assess the damage wrought by the fire and to piece together the history of what happened two weeks ago when it stormed Redding, a city of 90,000, overnight. The blaze has killed at least eight, burned 178,752 acres, and razed 1,599 structures. As of Friday, it was 49 percent contained. The fire swept in from the west of the city where it burned largely in tracts of forest around Whiskeytown Lake. The images from there show charred trees and denuded hillsides. Whiskeytown Lake.

Mitchell Armentrout,"The priest who ignited controversy last week by burning an LGBTQ-friendly flag on church grounds against the orders of Cardinal Blase Cupich has been removed from his Avondale parish. Cupich sent two of his top deputies to Resurrection Catholic Church on Friday to notify the Rev. Paul Kalchik that he was being removed as pastor, according to two sources close to the priest. In a letter to parishioners and staff released Saturday evening by the Archdiocese of Chicago, Cupich wrote that he has “become increasingly concerned about a number of issues at Resurrection Parish. “It has become clear to me that Fr. Kalchik must take time away from the parish to receive pastoral support so his needs can be assessed,” Cupich wrote. Kalchik could not immediately be reached for comment. Cardinal Blase Cupich. | Ashlee Rezin / Sun-Times files According to the sources, Kalchik and his elderly parents have received death threats since he defied Cupich on Sept. 14 by burning the banner, which featured a cross superimposed over a rainbow. There also have been threats of vandalism to the church, the sources said. Kalchik told the Sun-Times during an interview in his office on Tuesday that at least one person had forced their way into the church at 3043 N. Francisco Ave. last weekend, leaving a door open but not causing any damage.

Cupich, who has shared Pope Francis’ more welcoming attitude toward gays in the church, told Kalchik not to burn the flag, but the priest said he did it anyway in a quiet way during a closed ceremony with seven parishioners, featuring a prayer of exorcism over the torched banner. The flag-burning drew the ire of LGBTQ-equality activists, including Ald. Deb Mell (33rd), who led a small demonstration across the street from the church on Wednesday, calling on Pope Francis and Cupich to send this hateful bigot packing. Ald.

Michael Hardy,"Every weekend in countries around the world, grown men and women don elaborate costumes, adopt assumed identities, and meet up to enact fantastical scenes set in alternate realities. Although many still consider it a fringe activity, Live Action Role Playing ( LARP ) has exploded in popularity over the past decade, with chapters springing up from Minneapolis to Moscow. German photographer Boris Leist has spent the past four years documenting some of the world’s most dedicated LARPers. He first learned about the activity while shooting a Renaissance Fair in Norway, where he met a man dressed as a Tolkien-esque dwarf, complete with body armor and weapons. The man was an IT professional by day, but was so dedicated to LARPing that he had enrolled in an evening welding class to learn how to make his armor. ""I was very impressed by how high-quality his costume was,"" Leist remembers. ""I told myself, I have to learn more about this."" Leist began attending LARP events around Germany, where the activity is particularly popular. Many of the LARPers were wary of him at first, having been burned before by journalists only interested in mocking them. Leist eventually earned their trust by himself dressing up as a mendicant monk named Boris the Reader, with a full backstory. The portraits Leist captured, around 160 of which will be published in book form later this year by Kehrer Verlag, show LARPers fully inhabiting their alternate identities, with lovingly crafted costumes and carefully chosen accessories. Leist tried to portray the players with dignity and seriousness—to depict them the way they saw themselves, including captions that only use their LARP name, not their ""real identity."" Although LARPers are sometimes mocked as people who refuse to grow up, Leist respects their artistry and devotion to their craft. ""They’re really creating a whole world,"" he said. ""I like that these are people creating things in their free time, and not for money. They’re living out their creativity.""",This is what it looks like to take Live Action Role Playing to the next level.,2018-02-07T16:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Photos: Meet the World's Most Hardcore LARPers,https://www.wired.com/story/photo-gallery-larping/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a78d998b0a4d77375e868bb/191:100/pass/01_HOMEPAGE_Epic_Empires_CF006495_BB3_Buch_Final.jpg,wired,Wired,burned,1

The fire began north of Santa Paula, Calif., and burned its way into the city of Ventura, according to an incident report posted by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office. No fatalities had been confirmed on Tuesday morning, according to Eric Buschow, a sergeant with the sheriff’s office. (Unconfirmed reports of a death on Monday were erroneous, he said.) Only one injury had been reported, and one hospital, Vista Del Mar, a behavioral health facility, had been evacuated. Soon after, the hospital was “razed to the ground” by the fire, according to a local news report. The blaze has grown with astonishing speed. The sheriff’s office received its first reports at 6:24 p.m. Monday. By midnight, the fire was estimated to have reached 10,000 acres. Already, 27,000 people have been evacuated, and the dry conditions and high winds forecast through at least Thursday are expected to significantly expand the affected area.

Most of the time, you only have to soak dishes that you didn’t do fast enough. If you stay on top of things and get to the food crud early, you probably wouldn’t have to soak anything, ever. I mean, there are other potential reasons why someone would soak their dishes, but the primary cause is “I just don’t feel like doing dishes right now…” So you chuck them in the sink and go about your business thinking you’ve made things easier for yourself later. But before you walk away from that sink filled with soaking dishes, ask yourself: do they actually need soaking, or are you being lazy? Even if you do end up with some caked on crud, either from food getting burned or because it’s a substance that dries quickly, there’s still things you can do right then and there while you do the dishes instead of passively soaking away your problems. If you have a pan with stuff burned onto it, put the pan back on the stove, add some water, then crank up the heat until the water boils. It won’t take very long, and all that charred gunk will come right off. Or you can do a quick deglazing of your pan with vinegar. Voilà! If you’ve got stuff caked onto a dish, cup, or mug, add a little water, put another plate over the top, then run it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Boom, steam cleaned. Besides, if you have a dishwasher, there’s really no need to go overboard with your dish cleaning anyway. Dishes do not need to be spotless before you throw them in the machine. In fact, most modern dish detergents use enzymes to digest protein and starch on your dishes and other kitchen paraphernalia. If there’s no food in there to activate them, the detergent isn’t going to do much.

Baking dishes, blender pitchers, and other odd items that won’t fit in a microwave or can’t boil water on the stove, will need a minute or two with some warm water and soap in there.

That said, if you’re going to soak, do it while you’re doing the other dishes. Start the soaking, clean the other items that don’t need to soak, then come back to the soaking stuff.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","As California burns from both ends, the Camp Fire currently ravaging the northern part of the state has become the most destructive in its history. The fire had stretched 100,000 acres as of Saturday morning, according to officials. At least 6,453 homes and 260 commercial structures have been destroyed in the fire, the cause of which is still under investigation. With only 20 percent of the fire contained, officials say that 15,000 structures could be at risk. Paradise, a community of 27,000 people north of Sacramento, was almost completely wiped out by the fire after it engulfed the area on Thursday. The Camp Fire has officially damaged more property than last years record-breaking Tubbs Fire, which according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection burned 36,807 acres, destroyed 5,636 structures, and was responsible for 22 deaths. Three firefighters have been confirmed injured in the Camp Fire, with at least nine fatalities reported so far. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that none of the victims have yet been identified. Several individuals were found inside their vehicles, while one victim was found outside their car. Three people were found inside residences, and one victim was found outside of a home. In the southern part of the state, the Hill and Woolsey Fires are still raging as evacuations in Ventura and Los Angeles counties continue. Cal Fire estimated that the yet-uncontained Woolsey fire has burned tens of thousands of acres, while the Hill Fire has burned more than 4,000 acres. More than 200,000 people have been forced to flee the area. President Donald Trump, who is currently in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, took to Twitter early Saturday morning to blame poor forest management for the fires currently laying ruin to the state. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor, he tweeted. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Trumps ongoing tirade about alleged forest mismanagement in California has been challenged by California fire officials who argue the real culprit is climate change. In August, Trump erroneously blamed the states fires on bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.

Alas, that’s exactly what happened on Wednesday to YouTube TV. Just as the World Cup semi-finals game between Croatia and England started heating up, “&gt;the service went dark. As something of a mea culpa, YouTube has sent out an email to subscribers promising a free week of YouTube TV service. With most users paying ~$40 a month for the service, that works out to about $10 off their next bill. Curiously, user reports suggest the refund is going out to most, if not all, YouTube TV users — not just those who were watching (or, you know, trying to watch) the game in question. Meanwhile, some users have noted that reaching out directly to customer service lead to them getting a full month for free — so if you’re still feeling a bit burned by the whole thing, that might be something worth pursuing.

Emily Price,"I can remember intricate details about my friends and our conversations from 3rd grade, but if you send me out to pick up a pizza down the street and a 6-pack of beer there’s a good chance I’m going to come home without one of them, or at least text you and ask what that other thing was I was supposed to get at the store. And that person I met right before I left? Absolutely no clue what their name is anymore. While I always jokingly say that my issue is I have a bad short-term memory, according to USA Memory Champion Nelson Dellis, the issue isn’t that my memory is bad, it’s that no one ever really taught me how to use it. How would you like to be able to recall the name of a client or associate you just met? How would… Read more Read He recently spoke to Fast Company about some of his tips for remembering things (he was able to remember 201 names in 15 minutes). One of his suggestions: make it exciting. According to Dellis, our brains are naturally good at remembering the extraordinary things we comes across. He says that 90% of your day in non-interesting, so if you want to remember something a good way to do it is to try and turn it into something exciting. Specifically, he suggests turning it into something you can visibly see, since our brains are better at recalling images than abstract ideas. For instance, if you want to remember a name, Dellis suggests remembering someone else you know with the same name. The example he gave was remembering a new guy you meet named Nelson by picturing Nelson Mandela. I already do something similar when I meet new people, in that I try to associate them with a friend with the same name. It’s an idea that works, provided you actually know another guy named Roberto. For the pizza dilemma, the suggestion is to remember something like sizzling cheese or that time you burned the roof of your mouth on a slice. The key here is to take something pretty generic and transform it into something a little out of the ordinary. When your brain considers something a “wild and crazy” occurrence rather than your millionth trip to the grocery store, you’re much more likely to recall it later.

HOLLY JACKSON,"The most famous abolitionist July 4 protest took place in 1854, when Garrison mounted a platform adorned with an upside-down, black-bordered American flag and burned a copy of the Constitution. From the same stage that day, Henry David Thoreau declared that the moral failure of the United States affected even his ability to enjoy the outdoors, noting that “the remembrance of my country spoils my walk.” For the better part of the 19th century, many groups in addition to abolitionists, including Native Americans, utopian socialists, women’s suffragists and industrial workers, chose to use the Fourth of July as an occasion for social-justice agitation. The tradition of July 4 protest faded in the 20th century, but it re-emerged in moments of political urgency. Peace activists during the Vietnam War, for example, seized the day for fasts and demonstrations. In 1970, a committee of African-American churchmen urged the black community across the country not to participate in any festivities on July 4. Their “Black Declaration of Independence” listed 15 grievances, including “being lynched, burned, tortured, harried, harassed and imprisoned without Just Cause” and “being gunned down in the streets by Policemen and Troops who are protected from punishment.” In the weeks leading up to July 4, 1981, a group of military veterans, in a spirit of outraged patriotism, staged a hunger strike to demand an independent review of Veterans Administration hospitals, further study of the effects of Agent Orange and greater support for veterans’ mental health. In 1986, when the Supreme Court upheld laws that criminalized sodomy between consenting adults in private, gay activists held a rally in Greenwich Village in New York, promising to “disrupt traffic, snarl subways and show our rage” during the city’s July 4 celebrations. The tradition of July 4 protest has been largely dormant for a generation now — although the rallies and “die-ins” staged during the July 4 Senate recess last year, protesting efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hinted at a revival. These days, many Americans seem to disapprove of protests in general, and for them, demonstrations on the Fourth of July might seem particularly offensive, even worse than taking a knee during the national anthem.","Political action is part of the holiday tradition, too.",2018-07-03T22:56:47Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How to Protest the Fourth of July,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/opinion/protest-fourth-july.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/03/opinion/03jackson/03jackson-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1
Alexandria Sage,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - A monster wildfire in northern California burned unchecked on Saturday after it killed two firefighters, destroyed hundreds of structures and sent thousands of frantic residents racing from their homes. Some 3,400 firefighters on the ground and in helicopters and airplanes battled the 48,300-acre (19,500 hectares) Carr Fire early on Saturday as it ripped through Redding, a city of 90,000 people, in California’s scenic Shasta-Trinity area. More than 38,000 residents in Redding and elsewhere in Shasta County fled their homes as the fire began to gain speed and intensity on Thursday, destroying 500 structures and leaving Keswick, a town of 450, in smoldering ruins. The fire, which was just three percent contained after igniting six days ago, has been fed by high temperatures and low humidity, which were expected for at least the next week, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) Director Ken Pimlott. “This fire is a long way from done,” he said. A bulldozer operator and a member of the Redding Fire Department were killed in the blaze. A Redding hospital said it had treated eight people, including three firefighters. The flames erupted into a firestorm on Thursday when it jumped across the Sacramento River and swept into the western side of Redding, about 150 miles (240 km) north of Sacramento, before gale-force winds during the night created a fire “tornado.” “This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity, uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways,” Pimlott said. Firefighters and police were hustling door to door to usher civilians out of harm’s way, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). California has had its worst start to the fire season in a decade, with 289,727 acres burned through Friday morning, according to National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) data. Governor Jerry Brown requested emergency federal assistance to prevent an “imminent catastrophe” as Shasta County tried to find supplies and water for evacuated residents and care for horses and cattle rescued from ranches and farms. Wildfires have blackened an estimated 4.15 million acres (1.68 million hectares) in the United States this year. That was well above average for the same period over the past 10 years but down from 5.27 million acres (2.13 million hectares) in the first seven months of 2017, NIFC reported. Cal Fire said the Cranston Fire, about 110 miles (177 km) east of Los Angeles had blackened 12,300 acres and was 16 percent contained. The Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, which has charred 46,675 acres, was 29 percent contained.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"LOS ANGELES — Fires continued to ravage much of Southern California on Friday, as fast-moving flames scorched more than 159,000 acres across four counties, blackening the air and forcing closures of schools and roadways. In San Diego County, where a small grass fire that broke out Thursday morning had grown by night to 4,100 acres, residents near Bonsall and Oceanside scrambled to heed evacuation orders. At least six people were injured, and at least 20 structures destroyed. Brian Jones, a concrete contractor from Bonsall, dropped off his horses at the county fairgrounds after fleeing his home. “I didn’t want to leave,” Mr. Jones said. And then the flames “started coming over the ridge, right at the edge of our development, and it was ‘Oh, boy — time to go.’” Evacuation orders were lifted late Thursday in parts of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, but the situation remained dire in Ventura County, where 132,000 acres had burned and more than 430 structures were destroyed. That fire, just 10 percent contained, threatened to cross on Friday into Santa Barbara County, where new evacuations had been ordered. Here’s the latest: • A fire near Murrieta, in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, has burned about 300 acres. Seven buildings were destroyed, officials said, and the fire was 10 percent contained. • The threat was so severe that for the first time, state officials used the highest category in their color-coded fire hazard warning system. They painted much of Southern California purple on Thursday, for extreme danger, and many people received warnings to be ready to flee. Here’s what to do when you’re preparing to evacuate. • Late Thursday, with the fire that began in Ventura threatening scores of homes, Gov. Jerry Brown extended a state of emergency declaration to Santa Barbara County. He also requested an emergency declaration from the president that would make it easier for federal aid to reach Southern California. • Some residents who were forced to evacuate their homes because of the fires in the San Fernando Valley and in Bel-Air were told they could return on Thursday night. • Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said late Thursday that he was not aware of any deaths connected to the Los Angeles fires. (Want to get California Today, our daily newsletter on the state, by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Graphic Wildfires burned near and in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California, forcing thousands to evacuate. An official warns of a ‘very dangerous’ time in San Diego County. The fire near Bonsall in San Diego County ignited on Thursday and within hours spread to more than 4,000 acres with zero containment. Many parts of the Bonsall area were under evacuation orders, and officials encouraged residents with livestock to take their animals to the county fairgrounds. The area is known for its equestrian facilities. Ron Lane, San Diego County’s deputy chief administrative officer, said a large portion of a mobile home park had been destroyed, along with other houses in the Bonsall area. “This is a very dangerous period of time we’re going through in the County of San Diego over the next 24, 48 hours,” Mr. Lane said. “We have to be resilient.” A couple escapes the flames in Ventura on bicycles. Evacuees have also been talking refuge at the county fairgrounds in Ventura. Among them on Thursday was Patricia Hampton, 48, who lost her home near Ventura’s City Hall on Tuesday night. Ms. Hampton said that she and her boyfriend had gone to bed unaware of the approaching calamity. “I wasn’t feeling well and so I went to lie down,” she said. “We woke up in the dark hearing helicopters and what we thought was rain pelting the roof,” she said. The rain turned out to be embers, ash and debris falling as the fire raged across Ventura. The couple got on bicycles in the black of night, the glow of the fire as their only source of light, and rode toward the fairgrounds. “I got out with clothes on me and the bikes and that’s it,” she said. “I don’t know what we’ll do next,” she added. “I really couldn’t say.” Video In Bel-Air, a chance to return home. By Thursday night, several top local and state officials said they were encouraged by improving conditions in the city and county of Los Angeles. And as a result, officials announced that some Angelenos would be allowed to return home starting Thursday evening. The focus in the Bel-Air hills had turned to digging out burning embers and cooling down any hot spots that could easily ignite. It was easy to see how quickly the neighborhood could go up in flames: sprawling estates on narrow streets were surrounded by towering elms and bitterly dry pine needles. Blackened embers of tree trunks had tumbled down — one had hit a firefighter and burned him around the neck. Many of the towering iron gates that guard the mansions had been broken open by firefighters who needed to get to the slopes burning below. Some driveways were covered with splatters of pink from the fire retardant that had been dumped from aircraft above. Captain Brian Ferreira, a firefighter from Oakland, had helped mop-up on a hillside near a winery owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. While small patches of the hillside and the wine storage had suffered some damage, most of the winery seemed fine, he said. “Rupert will be glad to hear that, he paid a lot of money for that property,” said Hugh Siegman, 71, who lives just above the winery. Mr. Siegman and his wife returned to their undamaged home Thursday morning, before the evacuation had been lifted. “I would rather be here and be vigilant myself and get these guys to help if they need it,” he said. Reporting was contributed by Jennifer Medina and Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles; Thomas Fuller and Mark Storer from Ventura, Calif.; Roxana Popescu from San Diego; Richard Pérez-Peña and Matt Stevens from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

Rachel Thompson,"Forget about Hygge, Lagom, and Ikea's attempt to start a twin duvet revolution. There's a new Scandinavian trend in town. SEE ALSO: Ikea wants you to try a Swedish sleep trend that could save your relationship This trend encourages people to pick up litter while out running. So, it's not just good for your health, it's also good for the environment. It's called 'plogging'—a portmanteau of jogging and the Swedish plocka upp, meaning 'pick up.' So hot is this new trend that fitness app Lifesum is allowing its users to log and track their plogging activity as a workout. Plogging combines going for a run with intermittent squatting or lunging (to collect rubbish), which actually sounds like a pretty satisfying workout. According to Lifesum, a typical user will burn 288 calories in 30 minutes of plogging, which is more or less the same as what's burned off while jogging. As with all fitness trends, there are plenty of #plogging pics on Instagram, offering a glimpse of what this trend looks like IRL. Ploggers take plastic bags along with them so they can store the collected litter they find along their route. Swedish fitness app Lifesum claims it's the first health app to allows its 25 million users to log their plogging activity. Those using the health app can log plogging as a fitness activity, in the same way that they would log running or walking, and the app will estimate how many calories have been burned. Image: lifesum / rachel thompson Lifesum has also teamed up with the non-profit Keep America Beautiful to provide an online resource for ploggers who want to log the rubbish they've collected. Mike Rosen, senior vice president at Keep America Beautiful, thinks plogging is a great way to encourage people to make a difference in their local environment.

Emily Price,"Gin is kind of having a moment right now. For distilleries, gin is a lot easier to get started with, simply because it doesn’t require barrel aging. If you’re a new distillery you can distill a gin and start selling it almost immediately, while a new whiskey distillery might have to wait a few years before it has a product to sell. You can also get pretty creative when it comes to gin. The botanicals and fruit that a distiller chooses vary from distillery to distillery, making it so that, for the most part, no gin is the same. It is essentially flavored vodka, after, so there’s a lot of creativity that goes into the process. What’s better than serving gin and tonics at a party? Having a whole gin and tonic bar, that’s… Read more Read I recently visited Four Pillars in Healesville, Australia and tasted through its lineup of gin (including its super-unique Shiraz gin made using wine grapes). Beyond interesting (and delicious) gin, the distillery also suggested an interesting way of trying it. First, pour yourself a shot of gin. You don’t need to fill a shot glass up (although you certainly can), but pour yourself enough to fill your mouth. Smell it and see what botanicals you can pick up, and then take a full shot of gin and let it rest calmly on the top of your tongue with your mouth closed for 15 seconds. The idea here is literally to sit with your mouth full of gin for 15 seconds. You’re not agitating it our aerating it, just holding it in your mouth. After 15 seconds, swallow that gin and breathe out. When you do, your mouth will light up with all of the different flavors in that gin. It sounds pretty bizarre, but it actually works. I tasted through their entire setup, and the only one I had any difficulty with was its Navy Strength gin, which at 58.8% was a bit… strong. While that one burned, none of the rest did, and the exercise helped me pick out a lot of flavors I don’t believe I would have otherwise, at least not at first taste, so easily. If you really want to get acquainted with your gin, give it a try.","Gin is kind of having a moment right now.

""Didn't you guys burn down the White House?"" Mr Trump reportedly asked in a call with Mr Trudeau over new tariffs. It is not clear if the comment was intended as a joke, but CNN report that it followed an exchange in which Mr Trudeau asked how the US could justify the tariffs as a ""national security"" issue. The US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from its allies - the EU, Canada and Mexico - last week. ""It is simply ridiculous to view any trade with Canada as a national security threat to the US,"" Mr Trudeau has said of the move. ""Canada became a country in 1867.

The reasons for the war included US frustration at the British forcing American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, as well as trade restrictions on the US. Another factor was British support for Native Americans as they fought against the US government's westward expansion.

ThinkGeek,"Banksy... How do we begin to explain Banksy? Banksy is flawless. He has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus. We also hear Banksy's hands are insured for $1,000,000. Each. We hear he does car commercials... in Japan. Banksy's favorite movie is Varsity Blues. One time, Banksy met John Stamos on a plane, and he told Banksy that he was pretty. One time Banksy punched us in the face... it was awesome. Okay, so some of that isn't true. We don't know a lot about Banksy because he's so secretive, but we do know he's got a passion for making street art.  But here's something no one but us knew about Banksy until recently: we share another passion - food.

In true Banksy fashion (and keeping with the theme of anti-consumerism), you won't know which print you get until you put your bread in it. He wouldn't even tell us how many different prints were produced. So… like your guess is as good as ours.  
As an avid anti-consumerist, Banksy also made a special request for the ad on this particular toaster. He wanted an honest ad with no promises and no marketing spin - just the facts. So, here's the anti-consumerist ad copy we were told to create:
This toaster will not provide you with happiness. It will not fill you with joy. It is a device that warms bread and burns art into it. It has no value. It has no higher purpose. If anything, it will only provide you with a temporary escape from the struggles in your daily life. Because at the end of the day, toast is toast. It's something you eat. And the fact that you can put avocado on it and take pictures of it for validation just means you're part of the problem.

Chris Velazco,"The problem is, the touch surface is easy to activate by accident, especially when the Buds are dangling around your neck. I burned through the Pixel Buds' batteries twice because my neck had un-paused Spotify without me noticing, leaving my screwed for the commutes home. The fact that this happened twice is surprising if only because of the Buds' battery life — in general, they last between four to five hours on a charge, Of course, the Pixel Buds mainly exist as a vessel for Google's Assistant. You access it by saying -- what else? -- ""OK, Google"" or by holding your finger against the right earbud, but the tell-tale Assistant bloop only happens when you do the former. It should really happen when you press the earbud, too, if only to make absolutely clear when the Assistant has actually started listening for a command. Once you get the hang of things, the experience of talking to Google Assistant through the buds is mostly identical to using it on your phone or through a Google Home. That's often a good thing, but I wish Google had done a little more to tune Assistant for wearable use. When I ask it to play a certain song, for instance, Assistant only does so after telling me the name, the artist and the service it's playing on. Uh, maybe just play the damn track, Google. Sometimes, Google Assistant appears to listen to what I'm saying and then fails to do anything about it. These weren't arcane commands, either — I asked the Assistant to play a song or playlist I had requested multiple times before, and it just hung. This was such a pervasive issue that I sent my first review unit back to Google on the suspicion that it was defective.

Adam Rogers,"The mudslides earlier this week that killed 17 people—eight more remain missing—came as a terrifying surprise in the early morning to the enclaves of Montecito and Summerland, nestled into the California coastline just southeast of Santa Barbara. But in most respects, they were also entirely predictable—and predicted. The Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history, burned almost 450 square miles of the Santa Ynez mountains in late December, a swath of steep, rocky chaparral as big as San Antonio. Then the rains came, a massive winter storm after almost a year of drought. This is the climatic and geomorphological history of the transverse ranges, the “fire-flood cycle”—as a scientific journal article named it in 1935. The mountains of Southern California burn and then liquefy with terrifying regularity, and, yes, more often than they used to thanks in some measure to climate change and increased human development. Only now, science is starting to catch up to the cycle—to understand how it works and predict when it will be at its worst. And those scientific insights are coming just in time for more and more people to build more and more houses at the feet of those eternally liquefying mountains. In one sense the mudslides—what geologists more properly call “debris flows,” because they contain both water and a diversity of stuff, from ash to houses—have always been predictable. Wildfires are getting more common, and wildfires make mountainsides more likely to give way. With vegetation burned away, roots that held underlying soil together are gone, and the cover that a canopy might have provided against rain vanishes as well. In Southern California’s chaparral biome, that vegetation adds another factor. Those shrubs and low, waxy plants are adapted to fires every few decades. Their drought tolerance comes in part from a resin-like coat on their leaves that helps retain moisture. But fire volatilizes that wax, which then coats the soil and ash left behind. “You develop these hydrophobic soils,” says Francis Rengers, a geomorphologist on the US Geological Survey’s Post-Wildfire Debris Flow Team. “Water that normally would hit the ground and soak in, because soil is porous, now it’s the soil and it’s like you put a raincoat on the landscape.” Dump enough rain onto that coat, though, and it penetrates, and that hydrophobicity can enhance erosion. Even the geology of Southern California’s mostly east-west mountain ranges makes debris flows more likely. The region’s frequent earthquakes—what, you want fires and mudslides to be the only disasters?—are evidence of “active tectonics.” Which is to say, those mountain ranges are growing boys and girls, always getting taller and steeper. More steep equals more likely to slide. The rock itself is, geologically speaking, “shattered”—above Montecito, where the Thomas-related slides were, it’s sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, much more likely to erode than, say, Yosemite granite. “It’s rock that’s loose and available to move,” Rengers says. So these SoCal debris flows are, quite literally, the stuff of literature. The great science journalist John McPhee wrote about them in “Los Angeles Against the Mountains” in 1988, and TC Boyle picked up on the terror of it all in his 2005 short story “La Conchita.” “A vanguard of boulders came sluicing across the freeway, followed by a soupy river of mud. A rock the size of a cannonball thumped into the underside of the U-Haul truck and a fistful of pellets—gravel, I guess—sprayed the side of my car,” Boyle writes. “The mud spread out across the pavement, seething around the tires and underneath the car and beyond, and soon dark tongues of it had pushed across the southbound lanes, too.” It’s good writing because it’s right. “The debris starts out in a loose state and gets agitated as it goes downhill. As it mixes with water, it attains a liquefied state that allows it to flow almost as readily as water, even though it’s charged with boulders and debris,” says Richard Iverson, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey. “The leading edge is chock-full of the largest debris, and that part has a lot of resistance. So what you get is a more liquefied, fluid part pushing that resistive front forward, but because you have the front it can become much deeper.” In other words, the leading edge of a debris flow is a moving dam, a wave of destruction that accretes yet more ammunition as it oozes forward as fast as 10 miles per hour, like the parade in Satoshi Kon’s Paprika —a “bouldery snout,” as Susan Cannon and Jerry DeGraff wrote in 2009, “followed by a more viscous body that transitions to a very muddy water flow.” The big stuff in the front acts like a bulldozer, the pressure of the muck causes even more damage, and the water can literally float cars off the ground and buildings off their foundations. “Down a steep canyon, the debris flow will be getting bigger and bigger,” Iverson says. “Once it hits flatter terrain or can spread out onto an alluvial fan or into a neighborhood, then it slows down and quits growing.” Fortunately, in recent years geologists have gotten better and better at predicting which slopes are likely to slide after fires, based on computer models using data from previous flows. So for example, Rengers’ team starts with satellite images of burned areas, comparing the green-ness of before images to the blackness of the afters to develop burn severity maps. “That’s called a normalized burn ratio image,” Rengers says. “It’s a quantifiable signal.” To that, they add soil erodibility data from onsite examination and the National Resources Conservation Service, the soil division of the US Department of Agriculture, combined with information on the steepness of the slopes that burned. “Areas with high burn severity, steep slopes, and high erodibility have the highest probabilities for where debris flows will originate,” Rengers says. And in fact, his group’s map of debris flow hazards shows the hills above Montecito and Summerland as having a very high probability of sliding. The area was under evacuation orders before Tuesday. It just needed one more ingredient: Rain. And that happened, too. “For the Santa Barbara County-Ventura area, it takes about a half an inch of rain in one hour for debris flows to occur,” Rengers says. “What we saw in the Montecito area was that there was a half inch of rain in five minutes.” So it was a coincidental catastrophe. Chaparral starts to grow back within months; the rains came just weeks after fire crews got the Thomas Fire under control. I drove through that part of the state two weeks ago, and the hillsides were black. “It was a really low probability rainfall event, like a 0.5 percent chance,” Rengers says. “That kind of explains the big response.” What researchers like Iverson and Rengers don’t yet know how to predict is what kind of damage a debris flow will do and where it’ll go. The flatter land between the mountains and the sea, packed with buildings, is in its way more chaotic terrain than the hillsides and canyons. The question is, how far will a debris flow spread? “Once something comes out of the canyon and gets routed down streets and between houses, it becomes challenging to track the momentum and deceleration of the flow,” Rengers says. “We’re pretty confident we understand the physics, but the parameter values, like how much debris should we estimate? What water ratio? It’s almost impossible.” It’s all under active research; people from Rengers’ group are in Southern California already, flying planes over the area and taking measurements. Iverson’s group is working on models for the potentially city-killing debris flows that could conceivably come off of Mount Rainier in Washington. Fire researchers and geologists know a few things for sure: The 2018 fire season starts in about nine months. The cycle starts again. And what’s true in California is increasingly true everywhere. Fires are more likely to start in the built environment, along the wildland-urban interface where human beings live, and more human beings live there than ever before. Climate change means warmer springs and summers, and possibly increases in precipitation as well. Then the rains will come, and mountainsides will flow like water again.","Scientists are learning how to predict deadly mudslides. (After fires, when enough rain comes.)

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “If you want to catch a cat you have to stay up all night — that’s just the name of the game,” Ms. Petruska said as she prepared for another dark and cold round of cat stalking. “I’ve been a horrible insomniac my whole life so it suits me.” Coffey Park, the neighborhood where Ms. Petruska is focusing her efforts, may as well have been struck by a bomb. Well over 1,000 homes were leveled. Ms. Petruska and her team say they realize that with nearly 5,000 homes destroyed in the Santa Rosa area alone their effort is ancillary to the grieving and massive effort of reconstruction that is only just beginning. The bleak landscape of charred lots is still teeming with creatures stealthily crawling throughout the night, mostly unseen. Ms. Petruska says she knows there are still many cats on the loose because her motion-activated cameras capture them nearly every night, along with a parade of other nocturnal animals such as skunks, opossums and raccoons. To the families who lost everything, recounting how Ms. Petruska helped recover their cats often brings tears. “I just wanted my cat — that was the only thing I wanted back,” said Kelly Stinson, whose home in Coffey Park was destroyed. “I spent hours every single day looking for her.“ Photo Barbara Gray, right, and her daughter Kelly searched through a burned property where cat traps had been set out earlier.

Sara Ratekin, a veterinarian who has treated many of the cats rescued by Ms. Petruska’s team, says the fires have shown the ability of cats to survive perilous circumstances. Captured fire cats often arrive in her office with burned paws, singed whiskers — and many pounds lighter than before the fire. Unlike dogs, cats have an instinct to flee when they sense danger, Dr. Ratekin said. “I can explain why they ran away,” she said. “But I can’t explain why they became so wild so quickly.” In August, during the flooding in Houston caused by Hurricane Harvey, cats were spotted by rescue workers swimming or floating on furniture and debris trying to find high ground.

If cats were still home they would often be hiding — and when discovered would need significant coaxing to leave. Photo A cat that was found at the Journeys End Mobile Park in Santa Rosa. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times ”No matter if it’s fires or flooding, or any type of natural disaster, cats will often hide,” Ms. Jarl said. “It can be days or weeks before they re-emerge.” To lure Santa Rosa’s fire cats back into domestic life, Ms. Petruska assembles personality profiles of each cat she stalks. One cat likes the sound of whipped cream fizzing from a can. She carries a can in her car. Another cat answers to the sound of the crinkling of a bag of a specific brand of cat treats. She carries the treats. Unsurprisingly the most effective lure appears to be fish. Ms. Petruska soaks socks in the juices from cans of mackerel and hangs them from trees. On a recent evening at dusk, she drove through the countless rows of burned out houses to a neighborhood near a small creek. In near freezing temperatures, she hauled a cat trap across the molten remains of a home, careful to step over pieces of roofing and other remnants jutting up through the rubble. She passed a random assortment of household items laid bare in the detritus — a solitary teacup, a blackened metal colander and the burned out remains of a washer and dryer — before setting up a metal trap. By morning the trap was still empty. But she has persisted, working through the holidays. Around 10 fire cats have been found without any clues as to their owners; they are being kept at Sonoma County’s animal services department. She has found cats even after owners gave up the search. Cindy Fulwider fled her home in the early hours of October 9 as embers the size of golf balls rained down. She was convinced that her cat, whom she calls Sweet Baby, had perished. Then she got a call five weeks after the fire from one of Ms. Petruska’s team. “I really thought we would never see him again,” Ms. Fulwider said.

Lauren Sommer,"A house being rebuilt in Sonoma County where the Tubbs fire burned last year. The Tubbs fire was the most destructive fire in California history, destroying more than 5,000 structures. Lauren Sommer/KQED The drywall is finally ready to go up at Paul Lowenthal's new house, just outside Santa Rosa, Calif. After going through the most destructive blaze in California history, his long rebuilding process is almost done. Fueled by extreme winds, Sonoma County's Tubbs Fire last year killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes and buildings. Since then, the community has banded together to pick up the pieces. But it's also been grappling with a tough question one that faces fire-ravaged communities around the state: With wildfire a normal part of the California landscape, how and where should residents rebuild to protect themselves? Hundreds of Sonoma residents have opted to stay put, both financially and emotionally tied to their land. Lowenthal is one of them. He left his home on a windy night one year ago, called into work as Santa Rosa's assistant fire marshal. The Tubbs Fire was spreading into town and he had to get people out. ""It was exploding at a rate that I would have never imagined,"" he says. ""I left in my work truck and uniform and thought: worst case scenario, I'll be back tomorrow morning."" Later that night, he drove past his own neighborhood. Do I think those areas will burn again? Absolutely. It's done it before. Paul Lowenthal, assistant fire chief, Santa Rosa, Calif. ""You couldn't actually make out individual homes in here,"" he says. ""It just looked like an entire wall of fire. And then realized right away my house is gone."" He worked the next five days on just a few hours of sleep, until finally, he stopped to take stock. ""And then realized I have nothing,"" he says. ""Literally had nothing."" Picking Up the Pieces ""Do I think those areas will burn again?"" Lowenthal says. ""Absolutely. It's done it before."" It happened 54 years ago, when the Hanley Fire burned almost exactly the same area. But Lowenthal was keenly aware of this latest fire's effect on an already-tight housing market. ""I made a decision that it made more sense to rebuild here,"" he says. His daughter was also a big part of that decision. ""Could I have convinced her that we could live in a really cool place somewhere else?"" he says. ""Maybe. But this was our home."" In the hills above Santa Rosa, wooden frames of houses are rising among the blackened trees. Many of the rebuilt homes will include new fire-resistant building materials, something few had when the fire swept through. But many others almost 2,000 of the destroyed structures will not be required to meet building standards for wildfire-prone areas. That's because of California's decade-old zoning rules. Some homeowners are taking it on themselves to meet those building standards anyway, dipping into their insurance payouts to cover the cost. Others are not. City and county governments are under pressure to build new housing in areas at risk for wildfire because of the region's severe housing shortage. As people are trying to heal and recover, local leaders have been faced with balancing those delicate issues. With climate change making California's fires more extreme, their decisions will affect lives for decades to come. Wildland building codes This time, Lowenthal says, his new home will be built with cement-fiber siding and other fire-resistant materials and will better prepared to withstand fire. ""Between the roof, the siding, things of that nature, it was definitely a step that I wanted to take,"" he says. But Lowenthal isn't legally obligated to do any of that, as his home was outside the area subject to California's ""Wildland-Urban Interface Codes."" They include a broad range of standards for siding, roofs, decks, and windows, as well as requirements for gutters and attic vents that are meant to prevent embers blown ahead of a wildfire from igniting a home. Nearly a year after the Tubbs Fire, Paul Lowenthal's rebuild is finally nearing completion this time with more fire-resistant materials. Lauren Sommer/KQED The zones were established by a set of 2008 Cal Fire maps that outline wildfire risk by considering vegetation, fire history and slope. Sonoma County's zones are based exactly on those maps, while the city of Santa Rosa had extended the stricter requirements only somewhat beyond what was on the state maps. Almost 2,000 buildings destroyed in the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa and Sonoma County weren't mapped in those zones and won't be required to use fire-resistant materials. ""We don't have an extra set of rules or requirements that we put on people to rebuild,"" says David Guhin, Santa Rosa's director of planning and economic development. Guhin says Santa Rosa would be on shaky legal ground if it imposed new wildfire building codes on structures that weren't required to meet them when they were destroyed. But, since most of the homes were built decades ago, before most modern building codes, he says even the basic code upgrades for the new structures will help. ""The housing stock that's going in is much more resilient than the previous house stock,"" he says. Updating the Cal Fire maps Still, many believe Cal Fire's maps are outdated, since they don't reflect the extreme nature of today's fires. The maps assumed fairly benign weather conditions, just 12 mph for ""mid-flame"" wind speed, the height that affects fire behavior. During the Tubbs Fire, gusts hit almost 80 mph. Cal Fire is in the process of updating the fire hazard maps using more realistic data, including localized information and historic fire conditions. A draft of the maps is expected sometime next year. The new maps could put many homes into a fire hazard zone that aren't in one today. But several North Bay officials say the community can't wait for that to be sorted out. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This community needs to rebuild. Tennis Wick, Permit and Resource Management Department, Sonoma County ""I take solace in that the existing code is significantly better than what was there before,"" said Tennis Wick, who heads Sonoma County's permit and resource management department. ""I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This community needs to rebuild."" Wick says many homeowners are choosing fire-resistant materials anyway, such as cement-laden siding and metal roofs. Giving homeowners choices Some fire victims have opted to pull up stakes after living through the fire's emotional trauma or due to steep rebuilding costs. In the hilly Fountaingrove neighborhood of Santa Rosa, for-sale signs sprout from empty lots among the construction sites. But many other homeowners are tied to their property, either restricted by insurance policies that prescribe where they can rebuild, or simply priced out of other Bay Area homes. And that concerns Santa Rosa City Council member Julie Combs. ""I know I've heard stories about flooding along the Mississippi and thought, 'Why did they keep rebuilding there?'"" said Combs. ""I'm all for having property owners have choice,"" she adds. ""And right now, we aren't really giving them a choice to not build on the land they're tied to in a high-fire-hazard area."" Combs says she's interested in programs like those that already exist for flooded homes, where governments or neighbors can buy out inundated properties so they won't be re-developed. She's not confident that today's wildfire building codes are enough to protect people. The codes are meant to reduce risk, but don't eliminate it. Within the Tubbs fire footprint in Santa Rosa, 22 homes were built before the fire with the most recent wildfire codes. Twenty-one of them burned anyway. ""That doesn't strike me as particularly good odds,"" says Combs. Struggle over new housing Homeowners considering not rebuilding face another hurdle: there are few other places to go. In Santa Rosa, the Tubbs Fire obliterated five percent of the city's housing stock, exacerbating an already brutal housing market. Before the fire, the city estimated it needed 5,000 more housing units. The fire added 3,000 more to that number. ""We need to walk and chew gum at the same time,"" David Guhin of Santa Rosa says. ""We're going to rebuild our community as fast and quickly and as efficiently as we possibly can, but we also have to build new homes as fast as we can."" Santa Rosa is pushing for more ""in-fill development,"" putting housing downtown and closer to public transit. ""We made that a priority this year,"" he says. ""We put a number of polices in place such as expedited permit processing, reducing the impact fees substantially for housing in the downtown core."" But there has long been pressure to build in the surrounding hills, where the wildfire risk is highest. ""Development of single-family homes on the outskirts of town will happen on its own,"" Guhin says. ""There is a market for that."" A new project looks for approval In February, the Santa Rosa City Council faced down that question. San Francisco-based City Ventures asked for a zoning change to allow its Round Barn Village project to go forward. The 237-unit townhome development is proposed for a hillside that burned in the Tubbs Fire. A new housing project in Santa Rosa, California is proposed for a hillside burned in the Tubbs Fire. Lauren Sommer/KQED City Ventures made the case that the homes would be built using wildfire standards and would provide much needed affordable housing. ""We absolutely need the housing,"" said council member John Sawyer at the meeting. ""And lots of mistakes were made in the past with saying no."" But doubts hounded Council member Julie Combs. ""We are setting a precedent to build more new housing in a fire hazard area when we vote today,"" warned Combs at the meeting. ""I just think we need to not put more sleeping people in a fire hazard area."" The rezoning passed 6-1. ""I was really sorry to be a lone vote,"" says Combs. ""It becomes very difficult to explain why we would approve that and not approve more. And I have real concerns that more is coming. We don't need sprawl. We need to be building up."" That same pressure to build is also facing Sonoma County as a whole. ""I met with a resort that burned twice, once in the Hanley fire and a second time in the Tubbs,"" Tennis Wick says. ""New people came to see me about building a third one. And I told them I just could not support the project. There's an enormous pressure on us to be approving resorts in remote areas."" In communities still in shock from the fires, these fraught decisions won't come easily. ""I think that in a disaster, there's such a strong emotional pull to get what you lost back,"" says Combs. ""I think that's a powerful pull.""","In northern California, homes are being rebuilt in the same area that burned to the ground in last year's Tubbs Fire. Despite the risk, a severe housing shortage in the area is forcing tough choices.",2018-10-16T08:53:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Getting Back What You Lost — Rebuilding In A Wildfire Zone,https://www.npr.org/2018/10/16/656532029/getting-back-what-you-lost-rebuilding-in-a-wildfire-zone,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/10/11/rebuild3_wide-46026163f7abcfcc533a6ffb98f110986ae5332d.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,burned,1
Andrew Freedman,"Under a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy unveiled on Monday, burning forest products, known as biomass, will now be considered a ""carbon neutral"" fuel source. The EPA's action, which EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced before an audience of Georgia timber industry leaders, for now settles the question of whether chopping down trees, turning them into wood pellets, and then shipping them to power plants where they're burned for fuel will be counted as a renewable source of fuel like solar panels or wind turbines. SEE ALSO: Here's a running list of all the Scott Pruitt scandals This action comes before the agency's own Scientific Advisory Board could decide on how to account for the emissions of carbon dioxide, which is the main long-lived greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Proponents of this policy, such as Pruitt, argue that regrowing forests after they are cut down absorbs carbon dioxide, and therefore balances out the emissions from cutting down and burning trees in the first place. “Today’s announcement grants America’s foresters much-needed certainty and clarity with respect to the carbon neutrality of forest biomass,” Pruitt said in a press release. While Pruitt and other proponents of counting wood-derived bioenergy as carbon neutral are right that trees grow back, and can become net absorbers, or “sinks,” of carbon again, the problem involves a mismatch in timescales. A forest that’s been cut down for wood pellets that are burned in a power plant in England, for example, might take 100 years to grow back to its full carbon absorbing potential. During that time, more carbon dioxide emissions would’ve caused global warming to worsen, with irreversible impacts. Wood pellets. Image: Photothek via Getty Images Globally, forests absorb about one-third of annual human-caused carbon emissions, and in the U.S. that figure is about 11.2 percent, the EPA said. Cutting forests and burning them for energy would reduce that amount of absorption at a time when countries are struggling to cut emissions steeply enough to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels by 2100. In fact, a report last year from the UK-based Chatham House think tank found that, when emissions and carbon absorption are fully accounted for, along with the emissions from transporting wood pellets to power plants, bioenergy involves about as much carbon emissions as coal. Burning wood to produce steam for electricity may even be 50 percent more carbon intensive than coal per unit of electricity produced, the report found. According to William Moomaw, a scientist specializing in forests' role in climate change at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, the EPA's decision was made with ""zero consultation"" with agency scientists or its Science Advisory Board. ""It's pretty amazing,"" he said, of the process that went into the policy announcement. The EPA decision gives a boost to U.S. foresters that are clear-cutting forests to export wood pellets to Europe, which is the largest market for bioenergy. It also clears the path for more wood-burning within the U.S. ""Between this and the Europeans it means no chance of staying within the 2-degree limit,"" Moomaw said in an interview, ""It's just not possible."" ""It's a bad idea because anything that has carbon in it produces carbon dioxide when you burn it,"" he said. ""This is horrific."" In a statement, Andres Villegas, the president and CEO of the Georgia Forestry Association said that EPA's announcement, ""Reflects the clear scientific consensus on forest biomass.” “The Agency’s recognition of biomass as a renewable, carbon neutral source of energy will maintain and enhance markets for small-diameter trees, which encourages landowners to invest in forest health, and ultimately, to keep their land in trees,"" Villegas said. However, the lack of consensus on the EPA's own Science Advisory Board indicates how controversial bioenergy policies are in the scientific community, with many researchers sharing Moomaw's view that forests should be left intact, and renewables such as solar and wind should be encouraged instead. Scientists and environmentalists who oppose the new policy say that there are few guarantees that landowners will maintain the land in such a way to allow forests to grow back to the exact state they’re in today, and in fact climate change itself may make that impossible to do. The scale of the bioenergy trade is growing, however. The British alone are spending about $1 billion a year to import wood pellets from the U.S., and are counting it as a carbon neutral form of energy, Moomaw said. The U.S. has been exporting about 5 million tons of wood pellets per year, mostly from forests in Georgia and the Carolinas. Moomaw pointed out that even if the forests regrow, by the time they will again be absorbing comparable amounts of carbon dioxide to today's intact forests, it will be too late for the climate. ""If it regrows and we did get to climate neutrality sometime maybe 100 years from now the climate would have irreversibly changed a number of things,"" he said. ""The carbon dioxide in the air will have warmed the planet... When the tree regrows the glacier doesn't regrow,"" he said. ""The climate change effects are irreversible."" ""Carbon neutrality is not climate neutrality.""","Under a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy unveiled on Monday, burning forest products, known as biomass, will now be considered a ""carbon neutral"" fuel source.

Reuters Editorial,"FUYANG, China (Reuters) - The red, white and blue banners for U.S. President Donald Trump’s second-term campaign are ready to ship, emblazoned with the words “Keep America Great!” But they are made in eastern China and soon could be hit by punitive tariffs of Trump’s own making as he ratchets up a rancorous trade dispute with Beijing. At the Jiahao Flag Co Ltd in Anhui province, women operate sewing machines to hem the edges of “Trump 2020” flags the size of beach towels, while others fold and bundle them for delivery. The factory has turned out about 90,000 banners since March, said manager Yao Yuanyuan, an unusually large number for what is normally the low season, and Yao believed the China-U.S. trade war was the reason. “It’s closely related,” she said. “They are preparing in advance, they are taking advantage of the fact that the tariffs haven’t gone up yet, with lower prices now.” The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from China. After Beijing retaliated in kind, Washington announced levies on an additional $200 billion worth of products and threatened more, targeting potentially all of China’s exports to America - including flags. The campaign banners highlight a paradox in China-U.S. relations under Trump. At about $1 apiece, even suppliers to the Trump campaign, who, Yao says, are located both in China and abroad, can’t resist the low price. Yao’s factory has been making Trump banners since the time his tag line as a candidate was “Make America Great Again”. “Sales have been great ever since 2015,” she said. But Trump’s effort to wrest better trading conditions from China threatens that price advantage, and his hardline stance could eventually repel suppliers like Yao. “If he continues to demand tariff increases as he has been, or if he continues to agree with those who are against China, I definitely would not be able to accept (more orders),” she said. “Everyone can have a patriotic heart, but this won’t improve his economy, and instead it could make us Chinese just shoot ourselves in the foot.” The Jiahao Flag Factory doesn’t only make Trump banners. It churns out American and other national flags and specialty banners, including rainbow gay pride flags. Factory seamstress Sun Lijun is losing no sleep over the trade war, however. “I know that Trump’s tariffs targeting China will have some effect, but we’re not worried at all, since we’re producing foreign flags every single day,” she said.

Alexandra Harney and Steve Stecklow,"TOKYO (Reuters) - When Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin trading exchange, collapsed in early 2014, more than 24,000 customers around the world lost access to hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency and cash. FILE PHOTO: Mark Karpeles (R), chief executive of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, attends a news conference after a trial on charges of embezzlement in Tokyo, Japan July 11, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo More than three years later, with the price of bitcoin skyrocketing to more than $7,000, not a single customer has recouped a single cent, crypto or otherwise. It’s not clear when they will. The failed exchange has become stuck in a morass of litigation – a Russian doll of bankruptcies in Japan and New Zealand, four in all, plus lawsuits in the United States and competing claims from creditors. And although the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee recovered digital currency now worth more than $1.6 billion, under Japanese law the exchange’s customers likely will recover only a fraction of that. Kim Nilsson, a Swedish software developer who had more than a dozen bitcoins at Mt. Gox, isn’t optimistic of a payout soon. “It’s a legal twilight zone,” he says. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it took several years more.” The court-appointed trustee in Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, Nobuaki Kobayashi, did not respond to questions from Reuters about the payout process. There are few better examples of the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies than Mt. Gox. As Reuters reported in September, cryptocurrency exchanges – where digital coins are bought, sold and stored – are largely unregulated and have become magnets for fraud and deception. At least 10 of them have closed, often after thefts, leaving customers without their funds. In all, more than 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges since 2011 – two-thirds of those from Mt. Gox. Today, all of the stolen coins would be worth more than $6 billion, Reuters has calculated. Mt. Gox is one of the few collapsed exchanges that ended up in bankruptcy court; some just vanished. But the problem for Mt. Gox’s thousands of creditors is that under Japanese bankruptcy law, their claims were valued at the market price of bitcoin in April 2014 just before the Tokyo District Court ordered the exchange be liquidated. At that time, one bitcoin was worth $483. On the basis of the April 2014 value, the claims ultimately approved were fixed at 45.6 billion Japanese yen, currently about $400 million. Based on the current price of bitcoin, Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy trustee is sitting on enough cash to repay creditors whose claims have been approved more than three times that amount, according to Reuters’ calculation. But that likely won’t happen, according to two Japanese bankruptcy attorneys. In Japan, by law any funds left over in a bankrupt company’s estate after creditors have been paid go to shareholders. Mt. Gox is 88 percent owned by a Japanese company called Tibanne. And Mark Karpeles, a 32-year-old French software engineer and Mt. Gox’s former chief executive, owns 100 percent of Tibanne. Karpeles is currently on trial in Tokyo, accused of embezzling money from Mt. Gox and manipulating its data, as well as breach of trust. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of which carry sentences of up to 10 years. He served nearly a year in jail following his arrest in August 2015. Many creditors are livid at the prospect of a payout for Karpeles, whom they blame for Mt. Gox’s failure. “If the government just took all of it, that would be less offensive than if they just gave it to Mark,” said Aaron Gutman, a software developer who had about 464 bitcoins at Mt. Gox, which are now worth about $3 million. Added Henry Dienn, a 61-year-old entrepreneur in Japan who had 175 bitcoins at Mt. Gox: “Some of the people say, ‘I’d rather see the money burned.'” In a three-hour interview, Karpeles told Reuters he doesn’t want the money. The main reason: He expects he would be inundated with lawsuits. He says he already is facing about a half dozen. “I don’t want to be the beneficiary of this,” he said. “I don’t really need money. I work, I get by.” Karpeles also told Reuters he has been exploring a way to resurrect Mt. Gox under new management and ownership - at an estimated cost of $245 million. Among the factors complicating the liquidation process is a U.S. tech company called CoinLab. It agreed to partner with Mt. Gox in 2012, and is pursuing claims in a Japanese court totaling about $170 million against both Mt. Gox and Tibanne. Through a spokesperson, Peter Vessenes, CoinLab’s former CEO who had signed the agreement with Mt. Gox, declined to answer any questions, including whether CoinLab is still in business. CoinLab has been struck off the corporate registry in Washington state. In Delaware, state records and interviews show its registration status is “void” and it owes more than $400,000 in unpaid taxes. Karpeles, who is required to attend various bankruptcy hearings and is forbidden from leaving Japan, said Mt. Gox’s claimants will be lucky to be paid anything before 2020 - the year Tokyo is set to host the summer Olympics. On paper, Karpeles, who himself is in personal bankruptcy, stands to gain most of the surplus. But he would not get it all. Some of the excess would be allocated to Tibanne, and another part would likely go to the owner of a 12 percent stake in Mt. Gox. Who that is remains in question. FELINE FIRM The Mt. Gox exchange was first launched by Jed McCaleb, an American software engineer, in 2010. The domain previously had been used to trade cards in an online game. McCaleb told Reuters in an interview that he decided he wanted to work on other projects, and transferred the exchange to Karpeles in February 2011 for free. The only conditions were that Karpeles had to share the exchange’s revenues with McCaleb for six months, not hold him legally responsible for any problems and give him a 12 percent stake. Mt. Gox became part of Tibanne, which Karpeles had formed in 2009 as a web hosting and development business. He named the company after his cat. Karpeles said when he took over Mt. Gox, it had about 3,000 customers. As bitcoin grew in popularity among tech aficionados and investors, the exchange prospered. By 2013, it had nearly 1.1 million active accounts from 239 countries and handled upwards of 90 percent of global bitcoin trading. It generated about $40 million in fees in its last year, Karpeles said. About 30 percent of its customers were from America, he said. Karpeles feared he was going to run into regulatory trouble there because Mt. Gox wasn’t licensed to transmit money. In November 2012, Karpeles signed an exclusive agreement with CoinLab, a Seattle-based bitcoin project incubator, to service the exchange’s U.S. and Canadian customers. The partnership quickly soured. In a federal lawsuit filed in Washington state in May 2013, CoinLab argued that Mt. Gox and Tibanne had breached the contract by continuing to serve North American customers directly and failing to transfer their accounts to CoinLab. It demanded damages of at least $75 million. In counterclaims filed later that year, Mt. Gox and Tibanne argued that Mt. Gox had not provided access to customer accounts because they alleged CoinLab was not properly registered or licensed to do business. They also alleged that CoinLab had not returned $5.3 million in Mt. Gox customer deposits. CoinLab said in a court filing it had complied with all relevant laws and had registered to provide bitcoin exchange services with the U.S. Treasury Department’s FinCEN bureau. The case is on hold as a result of a petition filed by the trustee in Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, Kobayashi. Roger Ver, who is known as “Bitcoin Jesus” for his longtime evangelism for the digital currency, personifies the complexity of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. He was an early investor in CoinLab and was also a Mt. Gox customer with 577 bitcoins in his account when it shut down. Ver told Reuters he urged CoinLab’s former CEO, Vessenes, to withdraw the lawsuit against Mt. Gox and Tibanne because he considered the suit “frivolous.” He did not elaborate. Ver was also a customer of Bitcoinica, a New Zealand bitcoin exchange where he said he stored nearly 25,000 bitcoins. It collapsed in 2012 following thefts of tens of thousands of bitcoins that year. Bitcoinica had kept customer deposits at Mt. Gox, so the New Zealand exchange became yet another creditor in the Japanese bankruptcy. The Bitcoinica bankruptcy estate’s claims in the Mt. Gox case are valued at 3.29 billion Japanese yen, or about $29 million. Mt. Gox was repeatedly robbed of bitcoins between 2011 and 2014 by unknown thieves who stole at least 650,000 bitcoins. They are now worth about $4 billion. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a building where Mt. Gox, a digital marketplace operator, is housed in Tokyo February 25, 2014. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo On Feb. 7, 2014, Mt. Gox said it had detected “unusual activity” on its bitcoin wallets and halted withdrawals. The price of bitcoins on Mt. Gox plunged. Later that month, Mt. Gox halted all trading and filed for bankruptcy protection at Tokyo District Court. At first, the exchange said that nearly all of the bitcoins in its possession – about 850,000 – were missing. But it later located 202,185 bitcoins in storage and on its system. Mt. Gox founder McCaleb said that in April 2014, before the court-ordered liquidation, he signed an agreement to sell his 12 percent stake to Sunlot Holdings, a Cyprus-registered company, for one bitcoin. Sunlot at the time was trying to purchase most of Mt. Gox and resurrect it, but the plan fell through. McCaleb said he never received the bitcoin. “It’s unclear to me whether the sale was actually completed,” McCaleb said. “It’s in this weird gray zone.” A spokesman for John Betts, who was part of the Sunlot investment group, declined to comment on the status of the sale. This past summer, U.S. authorities announced they had found at least one person involved with the Mt. Gox hacks. In July, a U.S. grand jury indicted Alexander Vinnik, a 37-year-old Russian, accusing him of operating an unlicensed money-service business, money laundering and other crimes. In its indictment, the government alleged Vinnik had received funds from the Mt. Gox hacks and laundered them through online exchanges including BTC-e, an exchange he operated, and Tradehill, a now-defunct San Francisco-based exchange. He remains in jail in Greece and is seeking to have his case heard in Russia, not the United States. Alexandros Lykourezos, an Athens attorney who represents Vinnik, said his client rejects all of the indictment’s allegations. “He says he has nothing to do with the Mt. Gox incident,” the attorney said. MULTIPLE BANKRUPTCIES Mt. Gox initially filed for a form of bankruptcy that allowed the exchange to be sold, and briefly considered offers from potential buyers, including Sunlot. But a deal never happened. On April 24, 2014, the Tokyo District Court ordered Mt. Gox to be liquidated. Kobayashi, a veteran Japanese bankruptcy lawyer, was appointed trustee. Kobayashi filed a petition with a U.S. bankruptcy court that led to CoinLab’s 2013 lawsuit against Mt. Gox being put on hold. He began conducting meetings to brief creditors several times a year, and posting reports online about the progress of the bankruptcy in both Japanese and English. As he sought to protect Mt. Gox’s estate, Kobayashi created bankruptcies within bankruptcies. He asked the Tokyo District Court to put Tibanne, Mt. Gox’s parent company, into bankruptcy on the grounds that he had been unable to get Tibanne to repay debts to Mt. Gox, according to a trustee report to creditors. The trustee also put Karpeles into personal bankruptcy. Different trustees were appointed to handle those cases. Kobayashi filed claims against both Tibanne and Karpeles. Kobayashi set up an online system for filing claims; 24,750 former Mt. Gox customers ultimately sought compensation. He valued bitcoin claims at $483 per digital coin, the market price on the day before the liquidation order, and converted that value into Japanese yen. “Those of us who were burned by this are now permanently locked into that depressed price,” said Gutman, the software developer and Mt. Gox creditor. According to Kobayashi’s most recent status report on the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, dated Sept. 27, as trustee he has received 163.7 million yen, or about $1.4 million, in fees since his appointment. Kobayashi also recently reached a settlement with the U.S. government. He recouped for the estate $2.6 million - half the funds U.S. authorities seized from Mt. Gox in 2013 for operating in the United States without a license. The United States got to keep the other $2.6 million. No creditors have benefited. Among the claims the trustee needs to evaluate is the one from CoinLab, the U.S. bitcoin tech firm that sued Mt. Gox and Tibanne in 2013 in the United States. With its lawsuit put on hold, it filed a claim for about 8.7 billion yen, or about $75 million, in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, a court filing in Japan shows. It also filed a claim in Tibanne’s bankruptcy case for about 10.8 billion Japanese yen, or $95 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Tibanne case records are not public so Reuters was unable to determine the basis for this claim. In interviews, Karpeles and several creditors, including Ver, blamed Vessenes, CoinLab’s former chief executive, for holding up compensation to Mt. Gox’s former customers. Records in the Mt. Gox case show the trustee rejected CoinLab’s claims but the company petitioned for a reassessment, which Karpeles and some creditors say has caused delays. According to Japanese bankruptcy lawyers, claimants are unlikely to be paid until disputes over large claims are settled. A spokesperson for Vessenes, ex-CEO of CoinLab, said he was unable to comment on ongoing litigation. CRACKS APPEAR AMONGST CREDITORS With the price of bitcoin soaring in 2017 – it’s up more than seven-fold this year – some Mt. Gox customers are hoping the bankruptcy trustee will revalue their claims. But disputes have emerged over the best way to convince him to do that. Some want to form a creditors’ committee to increase leverage. That involves getting a majority of the creditors – more than 12,000 – to support the plan, according to Japanese bankruptcy law. Japanese bankruptcy lawyers told Reuters that creditor committees are rare in insolvency cases. The court also would need to recognize the committee, they said. One creditor supporting a committee is Kolin Burges, a British software developer and cryptocurrency investor who had 311 bitcoins at Mt. Gox, about two-thirds of his savings. He said he recognized the difficulty of getting so many creditors to sign up and of convincing the court that the group fairly represents all creditors. “It’s going to be a tough task,” he said. Daniel Kelman, an American lawyer in Taiwan who had 44.5 bitcoin - today worth about $310,000 - stored with Mt. Gox, predicts further disputes. “People are going to fight over the value of claims,” he said. “For sure.” There’s also the issue of paying shareholders in Mt. Gox and Tibanne, rather than creditors. Like Karpeles, McCaleb, Mt. Gox’s founder, told Reuters that he didn’t “want to make money” from the bankruptcy. McCaleb said he would give “as much as possible” from any money he received to creditors – minus any legal costs or taxes. “The people that are more hurt by the whole Mt. Gox fiasco are more deserving,” he said. “It seems kind of silly that Mark or I would get it.” Meanwhile, Mt. Gox’s bitcoin assets keep climbing in value. In August, bitcoin’s underlying software code split, creating a clone called “bitcoin cash.” In addition to the 202,185 bitcoins that it already had, the Mt. Gox estate now owns an equal number of bitcoin cash digital coins. Those are now worth about $200 million, while the bitcoins are worth about $1.4 billion. In his latest status report on Mt. Gox, Kobayashi said he wished to proceed with distributing the assets “as soon as possible,” but that the timing and method “have not yet been determined.” By Alexandra Harney and Steve Stecklow.

Reuters Editorial,"INN DIN, Myanmar (Reuters) - Bound together, the 10 Rohingya Muslim captives watched their Buddhist neighbors dig a shallow grave. Soon afterwards, on the morning of Sept. 2, all 10 lay dead. At least two were hacked to death by Buddhist villagers. The rest were shot by Myanmar troops, two of the gravediggers said. “One grave for 10 people,” said Soe Chay, 55, a retired soldier from Inn Din’s Rakhine Buddhist community who said he helped dig the pit and saw the killings. The soldiers shot each man two or three times, he said. “When they were being buried, some were still making noises. Others were already dead.” The killings in the coastal village of Inn Din marked another bloody episode in the ethnic violence sweeping northern Rakhine state, on Myanmar’s western fringe. Nearly 690,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled their villages and crossed the border into Bangladesh since August. None of Inn Din’s 6,000 Rohingya remained in the village as of October. The Rohingya accuse the army of arson, rapes and killings aimed at rubbing them out of existence in this mainly Buddhist nation of 53 million. The United Nations has said the army may have committed genocide; the United States has called the action ethnic cleansing. Myanmar says its “clearance operation” is a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents. Rohingya trace their presence in Rakhine back centuries. But most Burmese consider them to be unwanted immigrants from Bangladesh; the army refers to the Rohingya as “Bengalis.” In recent years, sectarian tensions have risen and the government has confined more than 100,000 Rohingya in camps where they have limited access to food, medicine and education. Reuters has pieced together what happened in Inn Din in the days leading up to the killing of the 10 Rohingya – eight men and two high school students in their late teens. Until now, accounts of the violence against the Rohingya in Rakhine state have been provided only by its victims. The Reuters reconstruction draws for the first time on interviews with Buddhist villagers who confessed to torching Rohingya homes, burying bodies and killing Muslims. This account also marks the first time soldiers and paramilitary police have been implicated by testimony from security personnel themselves. Members of the paramilitary police gave Reuters insider descriptions of the operation to drive out the Rohingya from Inn Din, confirming that the military played the lead role in the campaign. PHOTOGRAPHS FROM A MASSACRE The slain men’s families, now sheltering in Bangladesh refugee camps, identified the victims through photographs shown to them by Reuters. The dead men were fishermen, shopkeepers, the two teenage students and an Islamic teacher. Three photographs, provided to Reuters by a Buddhist village elder, capture key moments in the massacre at Inn Din, from the Rohingya men’s detention by soldiers in the early evening of Sept. 1 to their execution shortly after 10 a.m. on Sept. 2. Two photos – one taken the first day, the other on the day of the killings – show the 10 captives lined up in a row, kneeling. The final photograph shows the men’s bloodied bodies piled in the shallow grave. The Reuters investigation of the Inn Din massacre was what prompted Myanmar police authorities to arrest two of the news agency’s reporters. The reporters, Burmese citizens Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were detained on Dec. 12 for allegedly obtaining confidential documents relating to Rakhine. Then, on Jan. 10, the military issued a statement that confirmed portions of what Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo and their colleagues were preparing to report, acknowledging that 10 Rohingya men were massacred in the village. It confirmed that Buddhist villagers attacked some of the men with swords and soldiers shot the others dead. The statement coincided with an application to the court by prosecutors to charge Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo under Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act, which dates back to the time of colonial British rule. The charges carry a maximum 14-year prison sentence. But the military’s version of events is contradicted in important respects by accounts given to Reuters by Rakhine Buddhist and Rohingya Muslim witnesses. The military said the 10 men belonged to a group of 200 “terrorists” that attacked security forces. Soldiers decided to kill the men, the army said, because intense fighting in the area made it impossible to transfer them to police custody. The army said it would take action against those involved. Buddhist villagers interviewed for this article reported no attack by a large number of insurgents on security forces in Inn Din. And Rohingya witnesses told Reuters that soldiers plucked the 10 from among hundreds of men, women and children who had sought safety on a nearby beach. Scores of interviews with Rakhine Buddhist villagers, soldiers, paramilitary police, Rohingya Muslims and local administrators further revealed: - The military and paramilitary police organized Buddhist residents of Inn Din and at least two other villages to torch Rohingya homes, more than a dozen Buddhist villagers said. Eleven Buddhist villagers said Buddhists committed acts of violence, including killings. The government and army have repeatedly blamed Rohingya insurgents for burning villages and homes. - An order to “clear” Inn Din’s Rohingya hamlets was passed down the command chain from the military, said three paramilitary police officers speaking on condition of anonymity and a fourth police officer at an intelligence unit in the regional capital Sittwe. Security forces wore civilian clothes to avoid detection during raids, one of the paramilitary police officers said. - Some members of the paramilitary police looted Rohingya property, including cows and motorcycles, in order to sell it, according to village administrator Maung Thein Chay and one of the paramilitary police officers. - Operations in Inn Din were led by the army’s 33rd Light Infantry Division, supported by the paramilitary 8th Security Police Battalion, according to four police officers, all of them members of the battalion. POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CASES Michael G. Karnavas, a U.S. lawyer based in The Hague who has worked on cases at international criminal tribunals, said evidence that the military had organized Buddhist civilians to commit violence against Rohingya “would be the closest thing to a smoking gun in establishing not just intent, but even specific genocidal intent, since the attacks seem designed to destroy the Rohingya or at least a significant part of them.” Evidence of the execution of men in government custody also could be used to build a case of crimes against humanity against military commanders, Karnavas said, if it could be shown that it was part of a “widespread or systematic” campaign targeting the Rohingya population. Kevin Jon Heller, a University of London law professor who served as a legal associate for convicted war criminal and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, said an order to clear villages by military command was “unequivocally the crime against humanity of forcible transfer.” In December, the United States imposed sanctions on the army officer who had been in charge of Western Command troops in Rakhine, Major General Maung Maung Soe. So far, however, Myanmar has not faced international sanctions over the violence. Myanmar’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has disappointed many former supporters in the West by not speaking out against the army’s actions. They had hoped the election of her National League for Democracy party in 2015 would bring democratic reform and an opening of the country. Instead, critics say, Suu Kyi is in thrall to the generals who freed her from house arrest in 2010. Asked about the evidence Reuters has uncovered about the massacre, government spokesman Zaw Htay said, “We are not denying the allegations about violations of human rights. And we are not giving blanket denials.” If there was “strong and reliable primary evidence” of abuses, the government would investigate, he said. “And then if we found the evidence is true and the violations are there, we will take the necessary action according to our existing law.” When told that paramilitary police officers had said they received orders to “clear” Inn Din’s Rohingya hamlets, he replied, “We have to verify. We have to ask the Ministry of Home Affairs and Myanmar police forces.” Asked about the allegations of looting by paramilitary police officers, he said the police would investigate. He expressed surprise when told that Buddhist villagers had confessed to burning Rohingya homes, then added, “We recognize that many, many different allegations are there, but we need to verify who did it. It is very difficult in the current situation.” Zaw Htay defended the military operation in Rakhine. “The international community needs to understand who did the first terrorist attacks. If that kind of terrorist attack took place in European countries, in the United States, in London, New York, Washington, what would the media say?” NEIGHBOR TURNS ON NEIGHBOR Inn Din lies between the Mayu mountain range and the Bay of Bengal, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Rakhine’s state capital Sittwe. The settlement is made up of a scattering of hamlets around a school, clinic and Buddhist monastery. Buddhist homes cluster in the northern part of the village. For many years there had been tensions between the Buddhists and their Muslim neighbors, who accounted for almost 90 percent of the roughly 7,000 people in the village. But the two communities had managed to co-exist, fishing the coastal waters and cultivating rice in the paddies. In October 2016, Rohingya militants attacked three police posts in northern Rakhine – the beginning of a new insurgency. After the attacks, Rohingya in Inn Din said many Buddhists stopped hiring them as farmhands and home help. The Buddhists said the Rohingya stopped showing up for work. On Aug. 25 last year, the rebels struck again, hitting 30 police posts and an army base. The closest attack was just 4 km to the north. In Inn Din, several hundred fearful Buddhists took refuge in the monastery in the center of the village, more than a dozen of their number said. Inn Din’s Buddhist night watchman San Thein, 36, said Buddhist villagers feared being “swallowed up” by their Muslim neighbors. A Buddhist elder said all Rohingya, “including children,” were part of the insurgency and therefore “terrorists.” On Aug. 27, about 80 troops from Myanmar’s 33rd Light Infantry Division arrived in Inn Din, nine Buddhist villagers said. Two paramilitary police officers and Soe Chay, the retired soldier, said the troops belonged to the 11th infantry regiment of this division. The army officer in charge told villagers they must cook for the soldiers and act as lookouts at night, Soe Chay said. The officer promised his troops would protect Buddhist villagers from their Rohingya neighbors. Five Buddhist villagers said the officer told them they could volunteer to join security operations. Young volunteers would need their parents’ permission to join the troops, however. The army found willing participants among Inn Din’s Buddhist “security group,” nine members of the organization and two other villagers said. This informal militia was formed after violence broke out in 2012 between Rakhine’s Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, sparked by reports of the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by three Muslim men. Myanmar media reported at the time that the three were sentenced to death by a district court. Inn Din’s security group built watch huts around the Buddhist part of the village, and its members took turns to stand guard. Its ranks included Buddhist firefighters, school teachers, students and unemployed young men. They were useful to the military because they knew the local geography, said Inn Din’s Buddhist administrator, Maung Thein Chay. Most of the group’s 80 to 100 men armed themselves with machetes and sticks. They also had a handful of guns, according to one member. Some wore green fatigue-style clothing they called “militia suits.” ORGANIZING THE ARSON ATTACKS In the days that followed the 33rd Light Infantry’s arrival, soldiers, police and Buddhist villagers burned most of the homes of Inn Din’s Rohingya Muslims, a dozen Buddhist residents said. Two of the paramilitary police officers, both members of the 8th Security Police Battalion, said their battalion raided Rohingya hamlets with soldiers from the newly arrived 33rd Light Infantry. One of the police officers said he received verbal orders from his commander to “go and clear” areas where Rohingya lived, which he took to mean to burn them. The second police officer described taking part in several raids on villages north of Inn Din. The raids involved at least 20 soldiers and between five and seven police, he said. A military captain or major led the soldiers, while a police captain oversaw the police team. The purpose of the raids was to deter the Rohingya from returning. “If they have a place to live, if they have food to eat, they can carry out more attacks,” he said. “That’s why we burned their houses, mainly for security reasons.” Soldiers and paramilitary police wore civilian shirts and shorts to blend in with the villagers, according to the second police officer and Inn Din’s Buddhist administrator, Maung Thein Chay. If the media identified the involvement of security personnel, the police officer explained, “we would have very big problems.” A police spokesman, Colonel Myo Thu Soe, said he knew of no instances of security forces torching villages or wearing civilian clothing. Nor was there any order to “go and clear” or “set fire” to villages. “This is very much impossible,” he told Reuters. “If there are things like that, it should be reported officially, and it has to be investigated officially.” “As you’ve told me about these matters now, we will scrutinize and check back,” he added. “What I want to say for now is that as for the security forces, there are orders and instructions and step-by-step management, and they have to follow them. So, I don’t think these things happened.” The army did not respond to a request for comment. Human bones, including a spinal colomn, are seen in a shallow grave in Inn Din December 8, 2017. REUTERS A medical assistant at the Inn Din village clinic, Aung Myat Tun, 20, said he took part in several raids. “Muslim houses were easy to burn because of the thatched roofs. You just light the edge of the roof,” he said. “The village elders put monks’ robes on the end of sticks to make the torches and soaked them with kerosene. We couldn’t bring phones. The police said they will shoot and kill us if they see any of us taking photos.” The night watchman San Thein, a leading member of the village security group, said troops first swept through the Muslim hamlets. Then, he said, the military sent in Buddhist villagers to burn the houses. “We got the kerosene for free from the village market after the kalars ran away,” he said, using a Burmese slur for people from South Asia. A Rakhine Buddhist youth said he thought he heard the sound of a child inside one Rohingya home that was burned. A second villager said he participated in burning a Rohingya home that was occupied. “I STARTED HACKING HIM WITH A SWORD” Soe Chay, the retired soldier who was to dig the grave for the 10 Rohingya men, said he participated in one killing. He told Reuters that troops discovered three Rohingya men and a woman hiding beside a haystack in Inn Din on Aug. 28. One of the men had a smartphone that could be used to take incriminating pictures. The soldiers told Soe Chay to “do whatever you want to them,” he said. They pointed out the man with the phone and told him to stand up. “I started hacking him with a sword, and a soldier shot him when he fell down.” Similar violence was playing out across a large part of northern Rakhine, dozens of Buddhist and Rohingya residents said. Data from the U.N. Operational Satellite Applications Programme shows scores of Rohingya villages in Rakhine state burned in an area stretching 110 km. New York-based Human Rights Watch says more than 350 villages were torched over the three months from Aug. 25, according to an analysis of satellite imagery. In the village of Laungdon, some 65 km north of Inn Din, Thar Nge, 38, said he was asked by police and local officials to join a Buddhist security group. “The army invited us to burn the kalar village at Hpaw Ti Kaung,” he said, adding that four villagers and nearly 20 soldiers and police were involved in the operation. “Police shot inside the village so all the villagers fled and then we set fire to it. Their village was burned because police believed the villagers supported Rohingya militants – that’s why they cleaned it with fire.” A Buddhist student from Ta Man Tha village, 15 km north of Laungdon, said he too participated in the burning of Rohingya homes. An army officer sought 30 volunteers to burn “kalar” villages, said the student. Nearly 50 volunteered and gathered fuel from motorbikes and from a market. “They separated us into several groups. We were not allowed to enter the village directly. We had to surround it and approach the village that way. The army would shoot gunfire ahead of us and then the army asked us to enter,” he said. After the Rohingya had fled Inn Din, Buddhist villagers took their property, including chickens and goats, Buddhist residents told Reuters. But the most valuable goods, mostly motorcycles and cattle, were collected by members of the 8th Security Police Battalion and sold, said the first police officer and Inn Din village administrator Maung Thein Chay. Maung Thein Chay said the commander of the 8th Battalion, Thant Zin Oo, struck a deal with Buddhist businessmen from other parts of Rakhine state and sold them cattle. The police officer said he had stolen four cows from Rohingya villagers, only for Thant Zin Oo to snatch them away. Reached by phone, Thant Zin Oo did not comment. Colonel Myo Thu Soe, the police spokesman, said the police would investigate the allegations of looting. THE VICTIMS ARE CHOSEN By Sept. 1, several hundred Rohingya from Inn Din were sheltering at a makeshift camp on a nearby beach. They erected tarpaulin shelters to shield themselves from heavy rain. Among this group were the 10 Rohingya men who would be killed the next morning. Reuters has identified all of the 10 by speaking to witnesses among Inn Din’s Buddhist community and Rohingya relatives and witnesses tracked down in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Five of the men, Dil Mohammed, 35, Nur Mohammed, 29, Shoket Ullah, 35, Habizu, 40, and Shaker Ahmed, 45, were fishermen or fish sellers. The wealthiest of the group, Abul Hashim, 25, ran a store selling nets and machine parts to fishermen and farmers. Abdul Majid, a 45-year-old father of eight, ran a small shop selling areca nut wrapped in betel leaves, commonly chewed like tobacco. Abulu, 17, and Rashid Ahmed, 18, were high school students. Abdul Malik, 30, was an Islamic teacher. According to the statement released by the army on Jan. 10, security forces had gone to a coastal area where they “were attacked by about 200 Bengalis with sticks and swords.” The statement said that “as the security forces opened fire into the sky, the Bengalis dispersed and ran away. Ten of them were arrested.” Three Buddhist and more than a dozen Rohingya witnesses contradict this version of events. Their accounts differ from one another in some details. The Buddhists spoke of a confrontation between a small group of Rohingya men and some soldiers near the beach. But there is unanimity on a crucial point: None said the military had come under a large-scale attack in Inn Din. Government spokesman Zaw Htay referred Reuters to the army’s statement of Jan. 10 and declined to elaborate further. The army did not respond to a request for comment. The Rohingya witnesses, who were on or near the beach, said Islamic teacher Abdul Malik had gone back to his hamlet with his sons to collect food and bamboo for shelter. When he returned, a group of at least seven soldiers and armed Buddhist villagers were following him, these witnesses said. Abdul Malik walked towards the watching Rohingya Muslims unsteadily, with blood dripping from his head. Some witnesses said they had seen one of the armed men strike the back of Abdul Malik’s head with a knife. Then the military beckoned with their guns to the crowd of roughly 300 Rohingya to assemble in the paddies, these witnesses said. The soldiers and the Rohingya, hailing from different parts of Myanmar, spoke different languages. Educated villagers translated for their fellow Rohingya. “I could not hear much, but they pointed toward my husband and some other men to get up and come forward,” said Rehana Khatun, 22, the wife of Nur Mohammed, one of the 10 who were later slain. “We heard they wanted the men for a meeting. The military asked the rest of us to return to the beach.” FRESH CLOTHES AND A LAST MEAL Soldiers held and questioned the 10 men in a building at Inn Din’s school for a night, the military said. Rashid Ahmed and Abulu had studied there alongside Rakhine Buddhist students until the attacks by Rohingya rebels in October 2016. Schools were shut temporarily, disrupting the pair’s final year. “I just remember him sitting there and studying, and it was always amazing to me because I am not educated,” said Rashid Ahmed’s father, farmer Abdu Shakur, 50. “I would look at him reading. He would be the first one in the family to be educated.” A photograph, taken on the evening the men were detained, shows the two Rohingya students and the eight older men kneeling on a path beside the village clinic, most of them shirtless. They were stripped when first detained, a dozen Rohingya witnesses said. It isn’t clear why. That evening, Buddhist villagers said, the men were “treated” to a last meal of beef. They were provided with fresh clothing. On Sept. 2, the men were taken to scrubland north of the village, near a graveyard for Buddhist residents, six Buddhist villagers said. The spot is backed by a hill crested with trees. There, on their knees, the 10 were photographed again and questioned by security personnel about the disappearance of a local Buddhist farmer named Maung Ni, according to a Rakhine elder who said he witnessed the interrogation. Reuters was not able to establish what happened to Maung Ni. According to Buddhist neighbors, the farmer went missing after leaving home early on Aug. 25 to tend his cattle. Several Rakhine Buddhist and Rohingya villagers told Reuters they believed he had been killed, but they knew of no evidence connecting any of the 10 men to his disappearance. The army said in its Jan. 10 statement that “Bengali terrorists” had killed Maung Ni, but did not identify the perpetrators. Two of the men pictured behind the Rohingya prisoners in the photograph taken on the morning of Sept. 2 belong to the 8th Security Police Battalion. Reuters confirmed the identities of the two men from their Facebook pages and by visiting them in person. One of the two officers, Aung Min, a police recruit from Yangon, stands directly behind the captives. He looks at the camera as he holds a weapon. The other officer, police Captain Moe Yan Naing, is the figure on the top right. He walks with his rifle over his shoulder. The day after the two Reuters reporters were arrested in December, Myanmar’s government also announced that Moe Yan Naing had been arrested and was being investigated under the 1923 Official Secrets Act. Aung Min, who is not facing legal action, declined to speak to Reuters. VENGEANCE FOR A MISSING FARMER Three Buddhist youths said they watched from a hut as the 10 Rohingya captives were led up a hill by soldiers towards the site of their deaths. One of the gravediggers, retired soldier Soe Chay, said Maung Ni’s sons were invited by the army officer in charge of the squad to strike the first blows. The first son beheaded the Islamic teacher, Abdul Malik, according to Soe Chay. The second son hacked another of the men in the neck. “After the brothers sliced them both with swords, the squad fired with guns. Two to three shots to one person,” said Soe Chay. A second gravedigger, who declined to be identified, confirmed that soldiers had shot some of the men. In its Jan. 10 statement, the military said the two brothers and a third villager had “cut the Bengali terrorists” with swords and then, in the chaos, four members of the security forces had shot the captives. “Action will be taken against the villagers who participated in the case and the members of security forces who broke the Rules of Engagement under the law,” the statement said. It didn’t spell out those rules. Tun Aye, one of the sons of Maung Ni, has been detained on murder charges, his lawyer said on Jan. 13. Contacted by Reuters on Feb. 8, the lawyer declined to comment further. Reuters was unable to reach the other brother. In October, Inn Din locals pointed two Reuters reporters towards an area of brush behind the hill where they said the killings took place. The reporters discovered a newly cut trail leading to soft, recently disturbed earth littered with bones. Some of the bones were entangled with scraps of clothing and string that appeared to match the cord that is seen binding the captives’ wrists in the photographs. The immediate area was marked by the smell of death. Reuters showed photographs of the site to three forensic experts: Homer Venters, director of programs at Physicians for Human Rights; Derrick Pounder, a pathologist who has consulted for Amnesty International and the United Nations; and Luis Fondebrider, president of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, who investigated the graves of those killed under Argentina’s military junta in the 1970s and 1980s. All observed human remains, including the thoracic part of a spinal column, ribs, scapula, femur and tibia. Pounder said he couldn’t rule out the presence of animal bones as well. The Rakhine Buddhist elder provided Reuters reporters with a photograph which shows the aftermath of the execution. In it, the 10 Rohingya men are wearing the same clothing as in the previous photo and are tied to each other with the same yellow cord, piled into a small hole in the earth, blood pooling around them. Abdul Malik, the Islamic teacher, appears to have been beheaded. Abulu, the student, has a gaping wound in his neck. Both injuries appear consistent with Soe Chay’s account. Forensic pathologist Fondebrider reviewed this picture. He said injuries visible on two of the bodies were consistent with “the action of a machete or something sharp that was applied on the throat.” Some family members did not know for sure that the men had been killed until Reuters returned to their shelters in Bangladesh in January. “I can’t explain what I feel inside. My husband is dead,” said Rehana Khatun, wife of Nur Mohammed. “My husband is gone forever. I don’t want anything else, but I want justice for his death.” In Inn Din, the Buddhist elder explained why he chose to share evidence of the killings with Reuters. “I want to be transparent on this case. I don’t want it to happen like that in future.” Reporting by Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo, Simon Lewis and Antoni Slodkowski; editing by Janet McBride, Martin Howell and Alex Richardson.","INN DIN, Myanmar (Reuters) - Bound together, the 10 Rohingya Muslim captives watched their Buddhist neighbors dig a shallow grave.

Katie Reilly,"Adult film star Stormy Daniels and her attorney appeared on ABC’s the View on Tuesday to reveal a sketch of the man who she says threatened her to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump. Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, also offered a reward of $100,000 to anyone who can identify him. “His face is burned in my memory,” Daniels told the hosts of the talk show. The sketch was completed by Lois Gibson, a forensic artist whose sketches have helped law enforcement officials identify more than 750 criminals, according to her website. In an interview on 60 Minutes last month, Daniels said she was threatened by an unidentified man in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 and told to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. On Tuesday, Avenatti asked people to email IDthethug@gmail.com with any information about the man. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, described the threat to Anderson Cooper during the 60 Minutes interview. “A guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,'” she said. “And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ And then he was gone.” Daniels said she had a consensual sexual relationship with Trump in 2006 and received a $130,000 payment from Trump’s person attorney, Michael Cohen, days before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about the alleged affair. Trump has denied the affair and denied knowledge of the payment. Daniels is suing Trump in an effort to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement, and she expanded her lawsuit to sue Cohen for defamation.","""His face is burned in my memory""",2018-04-17T16:23:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Stormy Daniels Reveals Sketch of the Man She Says Threatened Her Over Trump Affair,http://time.com/5243126/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-threat-sketch/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/stormy-daniels-trump-the-view-sketch.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,burned,1

Mark Kaufman,"The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky. The West's fire season is now well underway, and it has been further stoked by heat waves and especially parched land. As a result of the now over 36,000-acre Ferguson fire, Yosemite — one of the most heavily-visited national parks in the country — has been inundated with tiny bits of particulate pollution, covering the park in a thick haze. SEE ALSO: California hit with two heat waves in less than a month. Here's why it matters. As of Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Forest Service assigned the Yosemite valley an ""Unhealthy"" air quality rating, meaning that everyone should reduce time outside, and people who are especially sensitive to this kind of pollution should avoid prolonged exposure. Yosemite's Half Dome peak can be seen at the top left, but the valley beyond is thick with wildfire haze.

Breathing this particle-laden air over time has been repeatedly tied to heart and lung diseases, particularly the accelerated hardening of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels. Although the park's visitor center remains open, Yosemite's site says that ""smoke may be heavy at times,"" and to ""expect poor air quality &amp; visibility.""

California has already experienced a busy fire season, as large fires returned to California's wine country in early July. This follows on the heels of 2017's terrible season — the state's worst fire year on record — which burned 1.2 million acres of land, an area the size of Delaware. This included December's destructive Thomas Fire, which burned less than 70 miles from Los Angeles. It proved to be the largest fire in California's history, burning an area nearly the size of sprawling Los Angeles itself. Since the early 1980s — when more reliable, modern record keeping began — the Forest Service notes that the amount of land that burns each year has generally doubled. Mismanaged forests and irresponsible behavior in fire country are both to blame, but every fire today is further enhanced by climate change-boosted temperatures, which parch Western land, turning it to tinder.","The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky.

Tom McKay,"MoviePass, the ticketing startup that burned through hundreds of millions of dollars trying to undercut the theater business by selling tickets at cost to subscribers, has screwed up an awful lot as of late. Its parent company Helios &amp; Matheson is being sued by shareholders for alleged fraud, as well as investigated by New York authorities for the same reason. Its alienated subscribers by randomly changing its terms of service or shutting down access to specific theaters or films on a whim to slow its cash hemorrhage, and its even infuriated those who canceled their passes by allegedly signing them back up without their permission. It is now reportedly getting spun out of Helios &amp; Matheson, probably because its owners stock price has plummeted into nightmare territory and theyve had to launch a fire sale just to keep funding MoviePass operations. Frankly, its unclear how theyve been able to secure any more money at all other than sheer inertia. In the meantime, rivals like Sinemia have sprung up, and theater giant AMC seems confident enough in the MoviePasss imminent demise that it is raising prices for its Stubs A-List service. Dont worry, though. MoviePass has something that will make it all better. That something is dogs. In an email to subscribers, the Verge reported, MoviePass Director of Barketing Chloe wrote that they were sorry for the ruff experience and that the company is listening, learning, and changing: Woof! Im Chloe, the Director of Barketing at MoviePass. Id like to explain why from time to time you may have had a ruff experience with us but it turns out that Im a dog and I cant talk.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas.

Elaine Pofeldt,"Starting a business can be exciting but also requires a lot of energy. As the going gets tough, one of the top challenges every entrepreneur faces is simply avoiding burnout and staying energized and inspired. The startup experience can be exhausting, and there’s a risk of getting bogged down in minutiae. Sometimes it helps to step back completely and think about your big-picture vision and goals and what you really want. To help you pause and reflect, ponder these eight questions for a few minutes and jot down your answers: What do I truly want from this business? How do I feel about the day-to-day realities of running it? Do I want to grow the business or keep it the same size? Am I comfortable with the amount of time the business leaves me for my relationships and personal interests? Can I grow the business in a way that lets me keep living my lifestyle, or am I willing to change my lifestyle for a while in order to expand it? Do I need to hack the way I’m running the business, so it keeps running smoothly as it grows? Will I ever want to sell this business, or is this something I can see myself doing for the indefinite future? How does my ultimate goal for the business influence the ways in which I need to get things done? Every Business Owner’s Motivation Is Different There are plenty of entrepreneurship gurus out there ready to tell you what you should want, but that doesn’t mean they’re right. Just because everyone around you is trying to raise venture capital or build a business with hundreds of employees doesn’t mean that’s the best path for you. These eight questions can help you refocus on what is. The goal of this exercise is to know where you stand in relation to what matters to you, so you can consciously make decisions to support your vision and goals. So once you’ve jotted down your responses, try writing a short paragraph that sums up these two things your overall vision for your company your top-priority goal for the next 12 months The act of writing this down makes you put into words what really matters to you, which is sometimes harder than you might think. I even recommend handwriting it–something you may not have done for a while. It will force you to slow down a bit and think on a deeper level. Related: This Silicon Valley Therapist’s Tips For Coping With Startup Stress How Purpose Curbs Burnout Repeat this exercise once a quarter or even once a month if things are changing really quickly. Keep a copy of your one-paragraph statement with you–ideally on your desk or even in your wallet–so you can refer back to it when you’re feeling pulled in many different directions or when you hit a rough patch. It can be hard to ignore the many competing voices around you. Actively reconnecting with your vision by looking at your own handwritten words on paper will help you stay focused on your dream. What if the way you’re running the business is actually in sync with what matters to you, but it’s sucking up all your time? In many ways, that’s an easier problem to solve. By looking for ways to automate routine tasks, bring on freelancers to supplement your efforts (as your cash flow supports it), and even outsource dull work to an industry-specific back-office provider, so you can start to get back some of your time. After all, no matter how much you love your work, you won’t be able to thrive as an entrepreneur if you never get any distance from it. So once you do get back some time, make sure you spend it away from your business, doing something that completely consumes your attention–whether that’s playing with your kids, mountain biking, or meditating–so you can clear the decks mentally. That will help you avoid burnout and allow you to stay connected to what’s really in your heart. The goal is to unblock your creative energy and free you to come up your best ideas–but it all starts with these eight questions and a simple writing exercise.

Elaine Pofeldt,"Raising your prices takes courage, but it’s often the only way to grow revenue when you’re a freelancer, solopreneur, or running a small service business. But it’s possible to do it without losing your clients–here’s exactly how. Step 1: Figure Out Where You’re Most Profitable When you first start out, it may be worthwhile to take on clients that aren’t very profitable to get some cash flowing and build momentum. Taking on a well-known client you can mention in your marketing or someone influential who can refer you to new business, even at slightly less than you want to charge, can help you get established—even if you’re barely breaking even. But after a while, it doesn’t make sense to keep working with these clients. You won’t generate enough to cover your overhead or reinvest in the business. So tally up the cash you’re bringing in from each client every quarter, and look at the time and money you’re investing to complete each client’s projects. This way you’ll know if you’re breaking even or turning a profit. If you aren’t, you may be better off either raising prices, or replacing the client with a more profitable one. Related: Your Freelance Rates Are Fine–Here’s How To Justify Them To Clients Step 2: Research Market Rates In consumer product businesses, it’s easier to figure out what prices the market will bear because your competitors advertise them online. In professional services business, you may need a different approach. Consider joining a trade organization that offers market reports on how much independent professionals in your field are charging. In my experience, $200 membership dues to such a group pays for itself many times over. Talking with friendly competitors in the same geographic area can also help you find out the common rates for a particular service. Are most of them charging more than you do? Then it’s probably time to consider a rate increase. Step 3: Calculate The Return On Your Clients’ Investments Clients won’t mind paying you more if you’re doing a great job and you can show them how hiring you more than pays for itself. Look for objective ways to quantify the financial gains you’ve brought a client before approaching them with a rate hike. For instance, if you coached a client’s sales team for six months and now sales have tripled, you can easily make a strong case for paying you more. The value you provide doesn’t necessarily have to translate directly into dollars, though. If you’re a speaking coach and your client has been invited to speak at better venues or more often, thanks to your coaching, then that may have value, too–even if your client isn’t getting paid to speak yet. Related: How To Break Up With A Client Without Burning The Bridge Step 4: Consider All Your Rate-Raising Options The simplest way to raise rates is to charge more for the same service, but that isn’t the only way. Maybe you can repackage the services you offer so that, for instance, clients can no longer get a particular service à la carte and instead need to buy a package that builds in pricing at premium rates. For more ideas, look at how other players in your niche are packaging their own products and services, then brainstorm a few options for yourself. Step 5: Test The Waters Before raising prices across the board, try upping your rates with one of your friendlier clients first, or initiate the rate increase with new clients only. If you get pushback, you may need to refine your approach. The Million Dollar One Person Business It could be that clients and prospects are willing to pay more, just not as much as you’re asking. So consider how you’ll deal with that possibility. You don’t want to work at a financial loss, but you don’t want to drive away all your clients, either. It could be that six months from now, your value will be much clearer, making your new rates easier for clients to stomach. Having a diverse group of clients, rather than concentrating your business on just one or two, gives you some leeway here. Finally, regardless of what you charge, you won’t have a business if you don’t get paid. No matter what, don’t do more work for any client before getting a payment than you can afford to lose if they default. So consider using the period when you’re testing out higher fees as time to give chronically late-paying clients the boot. If a client can’t pay the $1,000 they owe now, it’s not likely they’ll be able to foot a bill for $10,000 later.","These five steps can help you say goodbye to low-value clients and get more out of those that will really help you grow.

Amanda Lee Myers and Andrew Dalton / AP,"(VENTURA, Calif.) — A dramatic new wildfire erupted in Los Angeles early Wednesday as firefighters battled three other destructive blazes across Southern California. Flames exploded before dawn on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, which carries heavily traveled Interstate 405 through the Santa Monica Mountains where ridge tops are covered with expensive homes. Firefighters were providing structure protection as helicopters flying in darkness made water drops on the flames on the east side of the pass. Northbound traffic was halted, but southbound lanes remained open. Hundreds of homes burned in the area during the famous Bel Air Fire of 1961. The Getty Center art complex, on the west side of the pass, employs extensive fire protection methods. Elsewhere, use of firefighting aircraft has been constrained by the same winds that have spread the fires. The water-dropping planes and helicopters essential to taming and containing wildfires have been mostly grounded because it’s too dangerous to fly them in the strong wind. Tuesday saw gusts of over 50 mph (80 kph). Commanders hoped to have them back in the air on Wednesday morning, but all indications were that the winds will be whipping then too, fanning the flames that spurred evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people, destroyed nearly 200 homes and remained mostly out control. “The prospects for containment are not good,” Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said at a news conference Tuesday. “Really, Mother Nature’s going to decide when we have the ability to put it out.” Southern California’s Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region’s most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons. The largest and most destructive of the fires, an 85-square-mile (220-sq. kilometer) wildfire in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, had nearly reached the Pacific on Tuesday night after starting 30 miles (48 kilometers) inland a day earlier. The wildfire jumped the major artery U.S. Highway 101 to a rocky beach northwest of Ventura, bringing new evacuations, though officials said the sparse population and lack of vegetation in the area meant it was not overly dangerous, and the highway was not closed. The fire had destroyed at least 150 structures, but incident commander Todd Derum said he suspects hundreds more homes have already been lost, though firefighters have been unable to assess them. Lisa Kermode and her children returned to their home Tuesday after evacuating Monday to find their home and world in ashes, including a Christmas tree and the presents they had just bought. “We got knots in our stomach coming back up here,” Kermode said. “We lost everything, everything, all our clothes, anything that was important to us. All our family heirlooms — it’s not sort of gone, it’s completely gone.” Mansions and modest homes alike were in flames in the city. Dozens of houses in one neighborhood burned to the ground. John Keasler, 65, and his wife Linda raced out of their apartment building as the flames approached, then stood and watched the fire burn it to the ground. “It is sad,” Keasler said. “We loved this place. We lost everything.” Linda Keasler said they were just glad to be alive despite losing so much. “Those things we can always get back,” she said. “The truth is it is just things and thank god no one died.” Some 12,000 structures were under threat. A spokesman for the American Red Cross says they expect a shelter in Ventura County to be at capacity Tuesday night. Fred Mariscal says Red Cross officials expect about 400 people at the shelter Tuesday night. He says the shelter is serving meals, providing a mobile shower truck and has doctors and nurses on hand to provide medication for residents who were displaced by the wildfire. While the blazes brought echoes of the firestorm in Northern California that killed 44 people two months ago, no deaths and only a handful of injuries had been reported. In the foothills of northern Los Angeles, 30 structures burned. Mayor Eric Garcetti said the gusty winds expected to last most of the week had created a dangerous situation and he urged 150,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders to leave their homes before it’s too late. “We have lost structures, we have not lost lives,” he said. “Do not wait. Leave your homes.” Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds. Hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months. Fires in suburban settings like these are likely to become more frequent as climate change makes fire season a year-round threat and will put greater pressure on local budgets, said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College who has written extensively about wildfires. “There are going to be far greater numbers that are going to be evacuated, as we’re seeing now,” Miller said. “These fires are not just fast and furious, but they’re really expensive to fight.” In LA County, television shows with large outdoor sets including HBO’s “Westworld” and CBS’s “S.W.A.T.” halted production of because of worries about the safety of cast and crew.

Casey Quackenbush,"An American formerly imprisoned in North Korea was found enveloped in flames in a California lot last Friday. An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer stopped to help Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 38, but Gomes was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene, CNN reports. San Diego police are investigating the death, which police say initially suggests an accident or suicide, but the Medical Examiner’s Office will make the final call. Originally from Boston, Gomes was an American teacher detained in North Korea on Jan. 25, 2010 when he illegally crossed the border from China. At the time of his arrest, he had been living and teaching in South Korea. After his arrest, Gomes was sentenced to eight years of hard labor and a fine of about $600,000 for an unidentified “hostile act,” according to CNN. He was ultimately freed that August upon the intervention of President Jimmy Carter. Gomes’ motives for entering North Korea remain unclear. However, he was a devout Christian who regularly attended the Every Nation Church in Seoul, CNN says. Just one month before Gomes ventured in North Korea, an American named Robert Park, who attended the same church, also walked into North Korea. Park was detained for six weeks before his release, according to NPR. Following his release from North Korea, Gomes published an autobiography in 2015, Violence and Humanity, which he wrote while recovering “from injuries sustained while being incarcerated in North Korea,” according to the author’s bio.

DAN LEVIN and MATTHEW SEDACCA,"Let’s keep it simple: A trade war starts when a country imposes tariffs or quotas on goods from another country, prompting the second nation to retaliate.

Trade wars have “been going on pretty much since there’s been trade,” this history of the subject contends. There have been some notable failures: In 1689, King William of Orange put stiff tariffs on French wine and cognac, starting a crippling gin craze in England that lasted 50 years. The U.S. has also been burned by leveling steep tariffs, most infamously with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which is blamed for worsening the Great Depression. And before President John F. Kennedy enacted the Cuban trade embargo in 1961, he asked his press secretary, Pierre Salinger, to secure “a lot of cigars.” It wasn’t until Mr. Salinger had scored 1,200 of the best Cuban cigars that Kennedy signed the decree.

As influencer marketing continues to explode in terms of its impact, so has scrutiny on how these engagements are arranged and played out. This is especially true when it comes to the proper disclosure of an influencer’s relationships with brands when he or she receives any form of compensation for endorsements.

Such compensation is separate and distinct from unsolicited editorial praise for a product or service. But when compensation does occur -- be it money, trips, clothing, hotel stays, restaurant meals, jewelry, etc. -- legal penalties are more and more likely to ensue. Nothing less than the Fyre Festival fiasco illustrates the not only civil, but criminal liability that can happen for the parties involved.
In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is now paying close attention to endorsements and getting aggressive with influencers and brands in enforcing the FTC Trade Commission Act (the Act), which is the federal law governing truth in advertising. In April 2017 alone, the FTC sent out more than 90 “compliance reminder” letters to influencers, including Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lopez, as well as to the brands involved -- and this number continues to increase.

The FTC letters emphasized the influencers’ obligation to disclose their “material connections” -- meaning if they were paid or otherwise compensated by brands and other companies they endorsed -- so as not to mislead the public and violate the Act. The FTC has also begun fining and suing for non-compliance.
What happened with the infamous Fyre Festival
It’s not just with brands and influencers where the FTC is cracking down. The Commission s looking into whether brands' PR agencies are compliant too. As extensively reported in the press and in two documentaries, the Fyre Festival -- brainchild of “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland and his partner, rapper Ja Rule, was billed as an idyllic, bacchanalian, multi-day music festival on a private Bahamian island (touted as previously owned by Pablo Escobar, no less).
As was soon uncovered, several prominent influencers, including Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowsky, were prominently featured in a lavish promotional video and handsomely paid for their endorsements of the Festival. According to reports, Ratajkowsky received $300,000, and Kendall Jenner received $250,000 for just one glowing Instagram post. As a result of the video and promotions, Fyre sold out in 48 hours.
Unfortunately, neither Fyre Media, nor the influencers themselves, nor their agencies disclosed that the influencers were paid, in blatant violation of the Act. So, if your company or PR agency is hiring influencers, you'd do well to review the disclosure information detailed in the FTC’s Endorsement Guides and FAQs. The Guides’ intention is to provide transparency, so that anyone exposed to endorsements and promotions can determine if those materials were merely editorial reviews or the opinions of those giving them -- or material connections.
Fyre fallout
The fallout of the Fyre Festival has been monumental. In fact, the Festival never took place. The FBI got involved. McFarland is in prison for fraud. His company,which organized the festival, was forced into involuntary asset-less bankruptcy. And Billboardreported this past January that the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee was subpoenaing talent agencies and influencers involved.
These individuals were being asked to testify about what they did and didn’t know, including what happened to over $26 million McFarland raised to stage the event. The trustee might also file a complaint with the FTC, as this investigation has recently focused on Fyre’s social media marketing campaign. This would likely draw scrutiny of the festival’s PR agency, for organizing the disclosure-less social campaign, as well as of the many well-known influencers involved, for failing to comply with the Act.
The federal rules were, and are, something they (or their lawyer/managers) should have known they were required to comply with.
The takeaway for businesses
In my over seven years of experience representing all levels of influencers, I've seen brands, agencies and social platforms provide policies to guide those influencers on compliance with the Act. But sometimes the guidelines have not always been black and white. 
Here are seven best practices influencers, brands and agenncies must follow. They spell out exactly what these players must comply with, to avoid being sued or fined for not disclosing endorsements:
1. Disclose in each post. A single, general disclosure on a homepage, YouTube channel or the like, isn’t FTC compliant.
2. Make it close to impossible for consumers to overlook disclosures. In visual content, like that on YouTube or Instagram Stories, use clear, eye-catching images, as well as text in a large, simple-to-read font that contrasts with its background. Don’t use audio disclosures alone for visual content, as social media content is often viewed without sound. Repeat disclosures periodically, as viewers may tune in mid-stream.
3. Recognize that getting a discount on something is the same as being paid. Disclose if friends or family want you to review their product or service, and the personal relationship. For example, if a friend or family member opens a new restaurant and wants your feedback, in return for a free or discounted meal, realize that your action may be illegal. Even without the freebie, the restaurant owner's action implies that he or she expects a positive review. So, know what you're being asked for.
4. Also disclose if you're asked to positively review or endorse a hotel or resort that provides a free or discounted stay.
5. Know that a third party, even a charity, receiving money on your behalf is the same as being paid. Disclose if a brand you're doing business with donates to a charity in exchange for your or your client's review or endorsement.
6. Make dislosures about tagging brands on social. Let your followers know why that item was tagged and include a disclosure beside the picture or text, not in the section that's viewable only when a user clocks “more.”
6. Be careful with hashtag endorsements. Tags like “#client,” “#advisor,” “#consultant,” “thanks” or “#ambassador” are too vague. Use “#ad” or “#sponsored” instead. Put the disclosure at the very beginning of the endorsement or review, by itself, separated from and not mixed in with other text, links or hashtags.
7. Have an experienced influencer lawyer review your proposed disclosures.

"Jamiel Lynch and Darran Simon, CNN","(CNN) For the second time, a jury has failed to reach a verdict in the case of a Mississippi teenager who was burned to death four years ago. Panola County Circuit Judge Gerald Chatham declared a mistrial Monday when the jury could not reach a decision after nearly 12 hours of deliberations, according to CNN affiliate WREG. Quinton Tellis, 29, had been charged with capital murder because 19-year-old Jessica Chambers' death occurred during the commission of another crime: third-degree arson. He pleaded not guilty. Tellis' attorney could not be immediately reached on Monday. ATF: Teenager was set on fire with gasoline Chambers had left her mother's house in pajama pants on December 6, 2014, reportedly to clean her car. Later, firefighters responded to a report of a car fire and found her in the burning car on a rural road near her home in Courtland, a northwest Mississippi town of about 500 people in Panola County. Chambers was set on fire with gasoline, said investigators with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. She suffered third-degree burns over 95% of her body. During the trial, eight first responders, including firefighters, testified they were at the scene when Chambers said, ""Eric set me on fire."" She didn't give a last name. Chambers died the next day in a Memphis hospital. Prosecutors: Tellis deleted phone communication with teen Local police, the FBI and an intelligence expert worked the case for months and looked at all people named Eric in the area after Chambers' death, authorities said. The prosecution said it used cellphone technology, text records, surveillance cameras and interviews to identify Tellis as a suspect. Tellis, who grew up in Courtland, had known Chambers for about two weeks, a friend said. At the time of Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted all communications with her from his phone and stopped checking on her, prosecutors said. Tellis was arrested in February 2016 while he was an inmate in a Louisiana prison being held on an unrelated charge. In the first trial, the defense focused on the fact that Chambers didn't name their client. ""She said Eric,"" Alton Peterson, one of Tellis' lawyers, said in closing arguments. ""E.R.I.C. Eric."" But District Attorney John Champion argued that the fire injured Chambers so severely that she could not pronounce words clearly, and she may have been trying to say ""Tellis,"" the Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported. There appeared to be confusion among the six African-American and six white jurors before the judge declared the mistrial. The jury said it had reached a verdict and the court clerk read the not-guilty verdict recorded on a piece of paper. But at the prosecution's request, the judge polled the jury, and most jurors said their vote was guilty. The judge reread the instructions. More than an hour later, the jury said it was deadlocked and couldn't reach a unanimous verdict after about nine hours of deliberation. Champion said afterward that he didn't consider the mistrial a loss. ""I've had hung juries many times... and on the retrials we've come back and been successful on them. Some we have not,"" he told reporters. ""You do this as long as I've done it, you're going to have days like this."" CNN's Sheena Jones, Michael Phelan, Steve Almasy, Eliott C.

TIM HERRERA,"4. Relax! Earlier this month in the S.L. newsletter, I wrote about burnout after feeling a lull in my motivation and energy — my mojo was off. Hundreds of readers shared their experiences with burnout as well, and it was eye-opening to see how all of us feel this way sometimes, and that’s perfectly fine. If you’re feeling it too, take some time to yourself to recover. Even if that’s taking a “sick day” at work or just a long lunch, giving yourself space to be burned out can be huge. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a mountain of work that keeps growing, slice up your tasks into micro-goals and knock them out one at a time. Lastly, talk with someone. Experts say that talking with other people can be the strongest antidote to burnout. And really, that has been the core of Smarter Living for the last two years — just talking about these things we’re all a little unsure of and trying to get better in whatever ways we can.

MATT STEVENS,"Mr. Grassleys statement called Ms. Mitchell a widely recognized expert on the investigation and prosecution of sex crimes, who has frequently spoken on the subject and has instructed detectives, prosecutors and others on the best practices for interviewing victims of sex crimes. She has won several awards. For instance, in 2006, she was named prosecutor of the year by her office; three years before that, she was recognized by Janet Napolitano, then the governor, and Terry Goddard, then the state attorney general, as the Outstanding Arizona Sexual Assault Prosecutor of the Year. Shes one of these career prosecutors who specializes in sex crimes, Paul Ahler, who worked at the county attorneys office years ago, told The Arizona Republic. Its hard to find those people because a lot of people get burned out on those issues, but its kind of been her life mission. In an interview with Frontline published in 2012, Ms. Mitchell said she first became familiar with issues around child sex crimes when she was paired up with a senior attorney who was working a case involving a youth choir director accused of misconduct. It was different than anything that I would have ever imagined it being, she told Frontline. She added, It intrigued me, and I continued to do other work with that bureau chief.

AP,"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) A devastating fire raced through densely packed buildings in a centuries-old shopping district in Bangladeshs capital, killing at least 70 people, officials and witnesses said Thursday.
The fire in Dhakas Chawkbazar area was mostly under control after more than 10 hours of frantic firefighting efforts. Some of the about 50 people injured were critically burned.
The district dating to the Mughal era, 400 years ago, is crammed with buildings separated by narrow alleys, with residences commonly above shops, restaurants or warehouses on the ground floors.
The blaze started late Wednesday night in one building but quickly spread to others, fire department Director General Brig. Gen. Ali Ahmed said.
Many of the victims trapped inside the buildings, said Mahfuz Riben, a control room official of the Fire Service and Civil Defense in Dhaka.
Our teams are working there but many of the recovered bodies are beyond recognition. Our people are using body bags to send them to the hospital morgue, this is a very difficult situation, he told AP by phone.
The fire services director, Maj. AKM Shakil Newaz, said 70 dead have been recovered and were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Ambulances were arriving carrying bodies, and relatives were mourning in front of the morgue.
Most buildings in Chawkbazar are used both for residential and commercial purposes despite warnings of the potential for high fatalities from fires after one had killed at least 123 people in 2010. Authorities had promised to bring the buildings under regulations and remove chemical warehouses from the residential buildings.
Such tragedies are shockingly common in Bangladesh, where fires, floods, ferry sinkings and other disasters regularly claim dozens of lives or more.
In 2012, a fire raced through a garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing at least 112 people trapped behind its locked gates. Less than six months later, another building housing garment factories collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people.
The death toll from the latest fire could still rise as the condition of some of the injured people was critical, said Samanta Lal Sen, head of a burn unit of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital.
Sen said at least nine of the critically injured people were being treated in his unit.
Witnesses told local TV stations that many gas cylinders stored in the buildings continued to explode one after another. They said the fire also set off explosions in fuel tanks of some of the vehicles that got stuck in traffic in front of the destroyed buildings.
Some reports suggested many of the dead were pedestrians, shoppers or diners who died quickly as several gas cylinders exploded, and the fire engulfed the nearby buildings very quickly.
Officials said the firefighters struggled to get close to the scene because of heavy traffic and narrow alleys that were busy when the fire started.",Some of the 50 people injured were critically burned.,2019-02-21T07:22:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Massive Fire In Bangladesh Capital Claims At Least 70 Lives,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dhaka-bangladesh-fire_n_5c6e4e6ce4b0e2f4d8a2b210,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c6e4ecb2300007f01229b3b.jpeg?ops=1910_1000,,Huffpost.com,burned,1
Stephanie Vozza,"One of the biggest dangers to you and your team is burnout, and organizations are facing an employee burnout crisis, according to research by Gallup. Twenty-three percent of employees reporting feeling burned out at work “often or always,” while another 44% reported feeling burned out “sometimes,” the study finds. “Not only is employee burnout prevalent in organizations, but it has a significant impact on the health, happiness, and productivity of employees,” says Ben Wigert, lead researcher for Gallup’s workplace management practice. Employees who report burnout are 63% more likely to take a sick day and 2.6 times as likely to leave their current employer, according to Gallup. Why is burnout so rampant? Two reasons, says Wigert: Workplace engagement, well-being, and life satisfaction studies have had relatively flat numbers over the past several years, suggesting management and culture within organizations has ample room for improvement. “Second, we are seeing extensive disruption in the workplaces, from the continually increasing speed of technology and globalization to organizations becoming more matrixed,” he says. “Take concerns about management, add in that work demands are increasing and happening faster than ever, and top it off with mobile technology that connects employees to their work at home and on vacation. For us, these factors spelled out a recipe for workplace burnout.” Burnout can also be a symptom or outcome of a driven leadership style, suggests Adam Goodman, director of the Center for Leadership at Northwestern University. “There are times when a pace-setting style is useful, such as crises or unprecedented challenges,” he says. “However, this cannot and should not be the primary style. It’s not sustainable or healthy.” Fortunately, burnout can be remedied or reversed, according to the Gallup research. Here are four ways you can help your employees alleviate or avoid it altogether: 1. Improve communication Employees who have a manager who’s always willing to listen to their work-related problems are 62% less likely to be burned out, according to Gallup. Managers need to improve their dialogue with employees so there is an opportunity for employees to comfortably raise issues, and for managers to notice behavior that’s out of the ordinary, says Wigert. “The most proactive thing a manager can do to prevent burnout is establish a regular cadence of discussing work, career, and life with employees,” he says. “These don’t have to be big, time-consuming conversations. An easy starting place is ensuring you’re having informal quick connects on at least a weekly basis. The most engaging managers in the world do these almost daily, and they’re as simple as a quick hallway conversation, e-mail, IM, or phone call.” Once managers have established an ongoing dialogue and trusting relationship with an employee, it opens the door for them to more easily ask if everything is okay when they notice that an employee seems to be struggling. If an organization requires more out of employees due to a special situation, managers need to communicate this information, says Goodman. “Leaders should label circumstances as something that requires greater urgency and is time-bound so we know and don’t get caught in that circumstance,” he says. 2. Encourage teamwork Coworker relationships are important because they provide another line of emotional support for employees who are struggling. Coworkers often understand the stress of a job better than managers do, says Wigert. To encourage teamwork, Wigert suggests that managers collaboratively set team goals. “Working toward something together, that you’re committed to, forms strong bonds and fosters collaboration,” he says. “Define success and discuss the roles, processes, and partnerships that will get you there.” Wigert also suggests that managers discuss team strengths and frustrations, recognize and reward team performance, encourage socialization, and provide opportunities for team members to learn and grow together. “Teams learn and growth together when they experience new things and reflect on past performance as a team,” he says. “Having regular touch-base meetings creates a natural opportunity for teams to discuss recent events and plan for the future. Further, giving them stretch assignments, creative projects, and time to brainstorm encourages them to collaborate in new ways.” 3. Focus on strengths Employees who have the opportunity to do what they do best are 57% less likely to frequently experience burnout, according to Gallup. “When managers focus on employees’ strengths, they are much more likely to be engaged,” says Wigert. “Finding people who are a good fit for their job, positioning them to do what they do best, and engaging them is the recipe for success. Not only does this insulate them from burnout, but it also leads to substantially better performance and less chance of exiting the organization in the next 12 months.” Engagement is a huge buffer to preventing burnout, says Wigert. “The manager is responsible for about 70% of the things that impact employee engagement.” Employees are also at high risk for burnout when their strengths and interests are not a good match for the job. “This leads to constantly struggling with the work being difficult, frustrating, and exhausting,” says Wigert. “And even if the work isn’t overwhelming, lack of passion for your job can lead to burnout. Most people want to invest in work that is rewarding. When they don’t experience that return on investment due to the nature of the work or a toxic work environment, it weighs on their self-worth, direction in life, and overall well-being.” 4. Connect to purpose Employees are significantly less likely to be burned out when they can connect their work to their company’s mission or purpose in a way that makes their job feel important, according to Gallup. “People do not just go to work for a paycheck; they want to find meaning in what they do,” according to the Gallup research. “Managers must do more than point to the mission statement on the wall—they must show how their employees’ contributions make a difference in the world.” Connecting individual work to the organization’s mission also helps employees prioritize, says Goodman. “Each person can connect with the aspects of their work that make meaningful contributions while also understanding work is less valuable or useful,” he says. “Knowing what work to stop or defer is as important as knowing what work to do. That tends to give people powerful filter for first best use of time. Not everything is priority if I understand what’s important and will move the organization forward.”","Burnout is prevalent, has a significant impact on the health, happiness, and productivity of employees, and is totally preventable.

Evening Standard,"Burberry has been burning millions of pounds worth of stock in order to stop it getting into the wrong hands, reports say. The luxury label, famous for its trench coats and handbags, has destroyed more than £28 million of unwanted products in the last 12 months. According to The Times, it is common for designer brands to destroy unwanted stock in order to stop them being sold at discount prices. The brands want to preserve the exclusivity of their goods and prevent them from falling into the hands of illegal counterfeiters. Burberry admitted that unwanted stock had been burnt but said that they used specialist incinerators that harness energy from the process. Emma Watson. Marie Claire The company told the newspaper it takes the issue of waste ""extremely seriously"". But the value of the brand's waste is six times higher now than in 2013, with more than £90 million of Burberry products destroyed over the past five years, according to the newspaper. Destroying products has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting by ensuring the supply chain remains intact. Luxury brands including Chanel and Louis Vuitton also burn or destroy unsold stock. Environmentalists have criticised the practise of destroying unwanted goods in the past. H &amp;M has previously sent unsold stock to the Swedish city of Vasteras where it was burnt instead of coal to generate electricity. Richemont, the owner of Cartier and Montblanc, destroyed more than £400 million of watches over a two-year period after an excess in goods in the Asian markets.

East Bridgewater police said Rachel Hilaire and Peggy Labossiere burned the girl and told her 8-year-old brother they would cut off his head with a machete. “Two friends did a voodoo procedure is what they called it,” Deputy Police Chief Paul O’Brien said. “They are young kids, and they were writing it off as there were evil spirits possessing the kids.” The incident happened while the two kids and their mother were staying at a West Union Street apartment. A man who lives upstairs told Boston 25 News he had no idea what happened just feet away from where he lived. Authorities said, the mother told her friends that the kids had been possessed by the devil and they “needed to perform prayers.” “They applied a couple of chemicals to the face, packed it with some oil, we don’t have the identification of them,” O’Brien said. According to court documents obtained by Boston 25 News, the girl told police Labossiere tied her up and put water and other substances on her eyes. It was “cold and nasty, and it hurt.” “She is all scared up below the eyes,” O’Brien said. “From what we are hearing, they are probably not going to heal.” The brother told police that Labossiere “held a long stick to his throat and it was hard to breathe.

Eli Meixler,"Chinese authorities say the Tiangong-1 space station re-entered Earth’s atmosphere Monday, marking an end to the country’s first space lab mission. The Tiangong-1 made re-entry over the Pacific Ocean around 8:15 a.m. Beijing time (8:15 p.m. Sunday EST), with most of its parts burning up before crashing into the southern Pacific Ocean, the China Manned Space Agency said in a statement. The space station began its uncontrolled free-fall earlier this year. The 40-foot, 18,000-lb space lab, whose name means “Heavenly Palace,” was launched in September 2011 with a two-year lifespan to monitor the Earth’s surface temperature, sea ice and vegetation cover, according to the New York Times. Tiangong-1 was also planned as the first step in China’s ambitions to hold a permanent space station in orbit by 2022. Chinese astronauts have been barred from the U.S.-led International Space Station since 2011 over “national security” concerns. But Beijing sent two crews of taikonauts, or Chinese astronauts, to Tiangong-1 in 2012 and 2013, and landed a rover on the Moon in 2014. Chinese scientists lost contact with the station in 2016, severing their ability to control its trajectory, and in May 2017, China announced that that the lab had “ceased functioning” in March 2016 and would be allowed to tumble to Earth. But the loss of Tiangong-1 hasn’t slowed China’s appetite for the stars — it’s successor, Tiangong-2, was launched in September 2016.",The free-falling space station mostly burned up before landing in the southern Pacific Ocean,2018-04-02T03:18:52Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",China’s Tiangong-1 Space Lab Has Made Its Fiery Return to Earth,http://time.com/5224209/china-tiangong-1-space-station/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-106902887.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,burned,1
Janie Har / AP,"(SAN FRANCISCO) — A gas explosion in San Francisco shot a tower of flames into the sky and burned five buildings including one of the city’s popular restaurants before firefighters brought the blaze under control. There were no injuries.
Wednesday’s explosion and fire sent panicked residents and workers in the city’s Inner Richmond neighborhood fleeing into the streets as flames shot above the rooftops of nearby three-story buildings.
“We just felt the shaking, and the next thing we knew, people were banging on the door to tell people it’s time to start evacuating,” said resident Nick Jalali, 28, who was cooking at home when the electricity cut out.
Utility crews put out the fire about three hours after private construction workers cut a natural gas line, which ignited the fire, San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. Authorities initially said five workers were missing, but the entire construction crew was found safe, and no other injuries were reported.
Hayes-White said the construction crew was apparently working on fiber-optic wires.
Five buildings were damaged, including a building housing Hong Kong Lounge II, a reservations-required dim sum restaurant that is a fixture on the city’s “best of” lists. The fire began on the street in front of the restaurant.
Officials evacuated several nearby buildings, including a medical clinic and apartments, Hayes-White said. Vehicles on a busy street were rerouted as authorities cordoned off the bustling neighborhood.
Caroline Gasparini, 24, who lives kitty-corner from where the fire was, said she and her housemate were in their living room when the windows started rattling. She looked up to see flames reflected in the glass.
“We went into crisis mode,” Gasparini said. “We grabbed our shoes, grabbed our laptops and grabbed our passports and just left.”
Gasparini said they saw employees of the burning restaurant run out the back door and people fleeing down the block.
Firefighters worked to keep the fire from spreading while Pacific Gas &amp; Electric crews tried to shut off the natural gas line.
“It’s complicated,” Hayes-White said of stopping the flow of gas through the damaged pipe. Though she later acknowledged that “as a fire chief and a resident, yes, I would have liked to see it mitigated.”
PG&amp;E spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin said state excavation rules required crews to hand dig around multiple subsurface pipelines of various sizes before they were eventually able to “squeeze” a four-inch plastic line.
She said since the fire was contained to a limited area, the utility had to weigh the threat from the fire with the risk that would come from more drastic action.
“Had we turned the gas off to a transmission system, we would have shut off gas to nearly the entire city of San Francisco,” she said. “The objective of this was to turn the gas off safely and as quickly as possible.”
Subbotin said PG&amp;E would shut off a transmission line in an earthquake.
PG&amp;E spokesman Paul Doherty stressed that the workers who cut the gas line are not affiliated with the utility, which is under heightened scrutiny over its natural gas pipelines. A PG&amp;E pipeline exploded under a neighborhood south of San Francisco in 2010, killing eight people and wiping out a neighborhood in suburban San Bruno.
A U.S. judge PG&amp;E $3 million for a conviction on six felony charges of failing to properly maintain the pipeline and the utility remains under a federal judge’s watch in that case.

Rebecca Knight,"As a manager, you want to do right by your employees and support them through intense work periods so they dont get burned out. But this can be a challenge when youre feeling overly stressed yourself. How can you take care of yourself so that you have the time and energy to support your team? What steps do you need to take to reduce your stress level? And what actions can you take to improve your team members well-being?
What the Experts SayIts tough to find the energy you need to help others when you yourself are at your limits. Burnout  as opposed to more run-of-the-mill stress  can cause you to feel utterly depleted, says Susan David, a founder of the Harvard/McLean Institute of Coaching and author of Emotional Agility. And it can permeate all aspects of your life. You are overtired and under-exercised; youre not attentive to food and nutrition; and youre disconnected from relationships. But its not just you who suffers. Your team is picking up on your stress, and its making everything worse, says Whitney Johnson, the author of Build an A-Team: Play to Their Strengths and Lead Them Up the Learning Curve. So for the sake of both your health and the health of your employees, you need to summon all the resources you can to improve matters. Heres how to do that.
Make your own health a priorityBefore you can help your team members manage their stress, you need to manage your own. Instead of hunkering down and concentrating on your job, you need to stop, look around, and figure out how youre going to help your people get what they need, says Johnson. A good starting point is to take care of your physical and mental health. Eat healthy, wholesome food; exercise regularly; get plenty of sleep at night; try meditating, and find someone to vent to preferably not your boss. Taking care of yourself is not an indulgent luxury; its a matter of self-preservation. Johnson suggests sharing your tension-management techniques and rituals with your team. Say, heres something Im doing to manage the stress. This is how I cope.
Tackle the problem as a groupEven if you havent fully reigned in your stress, its helpful to demonstrate that you take the issue seriously. You can even suggest that you all take on self-care as a team learning meditation as a group or sharing tips about what practices are working to reduce stress. You can make it a team goal to keep stress under control, says David. Say to your team, Even in the context of this change, how do we come together? This is helpful for the group but will also keep you accountable for taking care of yourself. Dont force anyone into these activities though. A sense of autonomy can counteract the symptoms of burnout so you want people to feel they are making their own choices.
Exhibit compassionDont be so hard on yourself or your team. Burnout can often feel like a personal failing, says David. But of course, thats not true: We are all susceptible to it and, in fact, our environment precipitates it. We are living in an imperfect world, and yet we expect perfection. Many organizations breed stress. The ambiguity, the complexity, not to mention the 24/7 nature of technology, leads many of us to feel an extreme level of strain. Be compassionate. Recognize, both inwardly and publicly, that all of us are doing the best we can with the resources we have been given. This doesnt mean that youre lazy or letting yourself off the hook. Rather, youre creating a psychologically safe place for yourself and others. Johnson recommends talking your team through stressful periods in an honest but upbeat way. Yes, the workload is intense. And yes, big, high stakes projects are daunting. Tell your team, We are in this together, and I know we can deliver.
Set a good exampleYou also need to think about the [behaviors] youre modeling to your team, says David. If youre running from meeting to meeting and dont have enough time in the day to breathe, what message does that send? Set a good example by making downtime a priority. Show your team that you dont always operate in full-throttle mode at the office. Bring humanity back into the room, she says. Johnson agrees. When your people are completely overwhelmed, you need to encourage them to take regular breaks, she says. They need time to rest and rejuvenate and disconnect from work. Its also important to set limits on how much work encroaches on evenings and weekends. Whatever you do, dont send anyone on your team an email at midnight, says Johnson. Youre thinking, Ive got to get this out. But youre also throwing a grenade into your employees peace of mind. Instead, she recommends using Boomerang, or a similar program, that allows you to schedule emails.
Focus on the whyA common symptom (and cause) of job-related burnout is a disconnect between a persons values and the work at hand, says David. You feel stressed and tired, and yet you continue to work and work and work, all the while forgetting what drew you to your career and organization in the first place. It can be toxic. As a leader, you need to develop a shared sense of why as in, why are we driven to accomplish the mission? As a boss, its your job to galvanize your team. Remind them of the objective and why its important to the organization and your customers. When people have shared values and connection they are more likely to feel positively about their work.
Advocate for your teamIf you and your team are suffering under a heavy workload, it might be time to ask your boss for a reprieve. It is your responsibility to advocate for your team within the context of your organizations goals, says Johnson. She recommends talking to your boss about the effect stress is having on morale and performance. Say, My team is fully committed to this project, but people are tired. And we all know the law of diminishing returns. Convey the consequences of burnout and describe how it is in your bosss best interest to take action. There are going to be mistakes and slippage. And those will be costly. Explain that youre worried you might lose people who are valuable to the organization. Then ask, can this deadline be pushed back? Or can this assignment be curtailed? Think, too, about what you can put in place within your team that can help, says David. Perhaps certain meetings can be discarded or at least shortened. Its important that leaders go to bat for their employees.
Be a source of optimismWhenever work is frenzied and frantic, make a concerted effort to promote positivity, says Johnson. This is hard to do when you are stressed out but look for the good, she says. Smile at people. And be kind. Make sure you regularly acknowledge, recognize, and thank people for their efforts. Say, I notice you did X. Thank you. I appreciate it. Cultivate a feeling of community and social support. When your team hits a milestone or when a particular crunch time is over, celebrate. Acknowledge the accomplishments yours and the teams.
Principles to Remember
Do
Encourage your team to take regular breaks and seize opportunities to rejuvenate.
Support your team with inspiring language. Your message should be, We are in this together.
Go to bat for your team. If the workload is too heavy, ask your boss if deadlines can be moved or tasks reassigned.
Dont 
Neglect your health and wellbeing. Take good care of yourself and share your favorite stress-reducing strategies with your team.
Consider burnout a personal failing. Recognize, both inwardly and publicly, that people are doing the best they can with the resources they have.
Get bogged down in negativity. Be a source of optimism and try to cultivate positivity in the ranks.
Case Study #1: Set a good example for your team and celebrate accomplishmentsA couple of years ago, Peter Sena, the CEO and Chief Creative Officer of Digital Surgeons, the marketing and design firm, was in a crunch time.
We were rapidly expanding in every way possible, he says. We were doubling the size of our team, adding new clients, and building new offices. We were all working crazy hours. And the leadership team was approaching burnout.
The stress was taking a toll on his direct reports, too. I could tell my team was tired, he says. People were feeling anxious and hyped up.
Another significant sign of pending team burnout: employees were making mistakes. They were dropping balls.
Peter knew he needed to take action. He started by improving his own habits. I wanted to set a good example for my team, he says. When youre stressed, youre generally overworked and under-slept, and you dont eat smart. That needed to change. In addition to getting more exercise and taking regular power naps, Peter began practicing meditation. It helped me become more mindful and present, he says.
In fact, he found meditating so helpful that he introduced it to his team. We brought in a meditation [expert] to teach people how to do 10- to 15-minute mindfulness exercises, he says. It gets everyone to take a hard pause in the middle of the day.
Peter also made sure his team didnt feel constant pressure to be online. We use Slack, and I encourage people to use the do not disturb function in the evening, he says. Its helped us become more efficient in how we use email.
Finally, he urged his team to take regular breaks when they needed them. One of his employees, for instance, wanted to leave early once a week to take a yoga class. He was fully supportive. When people are stressed, its important to give them a level of control, he says. The more you give people the freedom and flexibility to shape their own path, the more committed they are to the goals of [the enterprise.]
Peter feels good about how he and his team dealt with and continue to deal with stress and burnout. In this industry, it is not uncommon to work well past 8 PM and to work every weekend, he says. But I wanted to create a more relaxed company culture.
Recently, Digital Surgeons experienced another hectic, high-growth quarter. To celebrate, one of his teams is going on a company outing to play laser tag on a Friday afternoon. The message is, We worked hard this past month. Lets take a pause and enjoy it, he says. Those little things make a big difference.
Case Study #2: Take care of yourself and focus on the organizations larger goalsMagdalena Mook, CEO of the International Coach Federation (ICF), a Lexington, Kentucky-based nonprofit dedicated to workplace development, says that when she starts to feel the telltale signs of burnout, she reminds herself shes being watched and observed by her employees.
The team follows the lead of the leader, she says. They pick up on [my] nervous energy and that impacts their ability to perform.
She says shes learned to develop self-awareness so she doesnt exhibit her tension and anxiety. Leaders are role models, she says.
Still, though, there are times of extreme stress at work when thats difficult. For instance, the ICF holds an annual conference for its chapter leaders. The event, which was held in Vancouver this year, involves a lot of complex logistical planning.
It requires many long hours because we are working with people from around the globe, says Magdalena. We have a board meeting with our Board of Directors a day before the event, which adds an additional layer of stress.
Needless to say, in the lead up to the conference, emotions fly high among her team members, she adds.
To cope, Magdalena made it a point to get some form of physical activity each day. This helped her relieve stress. Exercise clears my mind and allows me time to reflect.
She also made sure her reports focused on the overarching goals of the organization rather than on the line items of their to-do lists. We were all feeling overwhelmed because we all felt a huge sense of responsibility, she says. We were bringing our leaders together for this celebration, and we wanted it to be worth their time.
Magdalena says she reminded her team about the organizations mission. She wanted her team members to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves.
Our vision is that coaching is an integral part of society, she says. We need to remember that when times are tough. It makes the burden, along with the hours and the occasional frustration, worthwhile.
Once the conference was over, Magdalena took time to celebrate her teams accomplishment. She recognized and acknowledged just how hard her team worked. We relaxed a little and toasted a job well done with a glass of champagne, she says.

Bryan Menegus,"The Karma is finally dead. First announced in December of 2015, action cam company GoPro has pulled the plug on its heavily delayed, disastrous aerial photography drone, best known for its spectacular propensity for falling out of the sky. The news comes days after a report that said the company was laying off several hundred employees, most of whom were attached to its drone flight devision. GoPro came to prominence through a smart but unsustainable salvo of first-person extreme sports videos. It bet big on the Karma—its foray into drones—to distinguish itself from less expensive competitors like Xiaomi which have been eating away at its market share for mini action cams... by pushing into the already crowded drone game dominated by heavyweights like DJI. That plan, like so many Karma drones before it, crashed and burned. GoPro has been financially unhealthy for some time, and according to TechCrunch, cutbacks now extend to CEO Nicholas Woodman, who has reduced his pay to $1.

The internet was quick to point out that the whole scene was more spooky than festive — which is actually quite fitting for the Trump presidency. Now, to be fair, when the White House turned all the lights on during the day for the big reveal on Monday, the scene looked very different. Still, it looks pretty spooky at night.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - The Mendocino Complex became the largest wildfire in California state history on Monday as it raged at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, state wildfire officials said. The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged, has burned 283,800 acres (114,800 hectares) and was still growing, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The complex took over the top spot from the Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 2017.

CHARLES McDERMID,"This week is the anniversary of the birth of Phineas Taylor Barnum — known as “ the Prince of Humbug ” and the man behind “The Greatest Show on Earth.” Born on July 5, 1810, in Bridgeport, Conn., Barnum was most recently played by Hugh Jackman in “ The Greatest Showman,” a film that focused on Barnum’s role in creating what became the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, which closed in 2017 after nearly 150 years. But Barnum’s path to fame started with the exploitation of an enslaved African-American woman. In 1835, the showman brought Joice Heth, who was presented as the 161-year-old former nurse of George Washington, to Manhattan and exhibited her around the Northeast. After Heth’s death in 1836, Barnum sold tickets to her autopsy. In 1841, Barnum opened the American Museum in New York, which about 38 million people visited before it burned down in 1865. On display, among other things, was a menagerie of exotic animals that included beluga whales in an aquarium. (The whales died in the fire, and exotic animals roamed Manhattan’s streets for days afterward.)",Here’s what you need to know to start your day.,2018-07-03T20:01:43Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Asia and Australia Edition: Thailand, NATO, Malaysia: Your Wednesday Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/briefing/thailand-nato-malaysia.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/03/briefing/070418ambriefing-asia-promo/070418ambriefing-asia-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,burned,1
SCOTT BRANSFORD and CHRISTINA CARON,"As of Saturday morning the fire, which is known as the Carr Fire, had burned more than 80,000 acres, up from more than 40,000 on Friday. It has destroyed 500 structures and forced the evacuations of approximately 39,000 people, the authorities said on Saturday. Mr. Kewley, who lives about two miles from the Bledsoes near the Sacramento River in Redding, about 160 miles north of Sacramento, said the family had been keeping track of the fire but did not receive evacuation orders on Thursday. Then he said he saw the fire “start chewing through the other side of the river.” “Eight o’clock rolls around and everything just exploded, and everything was on fire,” he said, adding that subdivisions a mile away were “lighting up like the Fourth of July.” In the neighborhood in Redding where Ms. Bledsoe and the two children perished, the smoldering wreckage of incinerated homes lined the streets, sometimes juxtaposed with dwellings that had remained intact or sustained only minor damage. Downed power lines snaked across streets, which were largely empty except for the police and fire personnel surveying the damage and utility workers making repairs. The topography of the area, a mix of rolling hills, canyons and flatlands, spoke to the combustibility of landscapes in this part of Northern California, where communities are often built into what fire experts call the wildland-urban interface. Interspersed between streets and cul-de-sacs were swaths of open space filled with drought-stressed oaks, manzanita and brush, all of which provide powerful fuels when ignited.","Ed Bledsoe left his wife and great-grandchildren to run errands and gather supplies.

Brakkton Booker,"Fire shoots out from a Baltimore store on Gay Street as looting erupted in a five-block business section in Baltimore on April 6, 1968. Police sealed off the area. AP Editor's note: This story contains language some may find offensive. After the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder in Memphis 50 years ago this week, protests and civil unrest erupted in some 125 cities across the nation. Baltimore though was eerily calm in the first two days following the civil rights leader's assassination, before mournful tranquility gave way to anger and resentment. For more than a week, hundreds of homes and businesses were torched and more than 5,000 National Guard troops were deployed to restore order. Six people died in the unrest. Baltimore's riots in 1968 were not simply about King's death. The unrest laid bare problems linked to the city's long history segregation and economic disparities, which resurfaced during the city's latest civil unrest three years ago. Lots of comparisons have made between the 1968 riots and those in 2015. Both took place after days of peaceful protests following the death of a black man. In 1968 it was King. In 2015 it was 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who died after suffering a severe spinal injury while in police custody. In both instances hundreds were arrested and the National Guard was sent in to tamp down the violence. In April 1968, Tommy D'Alesandro III — known to many then as ""Young Tommy"" was just a few months into his term as mayor when he tried to assure Baltimore residents that authorities had the rioting in hand. ""I want to appeal to all the people of the city of Baltimore to remain calm, to be peaceful, that the National Guard, the State Trooper and the police department have the situation well under control,"" D'Alesandro said during a press conference. Robert Birt remembers this period vividly. ""It was warm. There of course was tension in the city,"" Birt says as he stands in the courtyard of the Latrobe Homes housing projects in East Baltimore, his old neighborhood. He was 15 at the time. And though he says this section of town was considered the ghetto, the neighborhood did not look as it does now, with many units boarded up. Behind him the words ""No Shoot Zone"" are spray painted on a wall. Fifty years ago, Birt says he remembers a mob of 15 or 20 people making their way towards a corner shop. Like him they were young and black. The crowd was making their way towards a corner shop owned by an older white couple. ""When they got in front, that's when I heard some people shouting 'they killed King,'"" Birt recalls someone in the crowd shouting. ""'These white crackers they killed King, these white so-and-so's killed King, they going to pay for it, we're going to burn 'em out."" Birt, who now teaches philosophy at Bowie State University, says someone tossed a Molotov cocktail and that corner store burst into flames. This scene was repeated throughout the city as numerous grocery stores, dry cleaners and appliance shops were destroyed — most owned by white folks no longer living in the majority black neighborhoods where their businesses were located. A man carts off a television set during looting incidents in Baltimore on April 7, 1968. Many businesses were broken into, looted and burned that Saturday and Sunday. AP Robert Embry was a 30-year-old city council member when the riots broke out. He represented Northeast Baltimore, which was predominantly white at the time. ""A number of people I knew had guns that they got out of the closet and had ready in white neighborhoods,"" he says, ""because they feared the African-American community would come into their neighborhood and do some kind of violence."" Embry is now president of the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation, which helps fight poverty. ""The city, then as now, was racially divided,"" Embry says. Wanda Draper is the executive director of the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History &amp; Culture. ""You still see there are definitely predominately black neighborhoods, there are white neighborhoods. There are black schools and there are white schools. Integration has kind of come and gone,"" Draper says, about today's Baltimore. She was in high school during the 1968 riots and lived in a well-off northwest Baltimore neighborhood where she grew up during the height of white flight. She says Baltimore's economic segregation remains a serious problem. ""You don't have a lot of poor neighborhoods that are integrated,"" Draper says. Elizabeth Nix is a professor at the University of Baltimore who directed an oral history project a decade ago centered on Baltimore's civil unrest. Part of that project was turned into a book, Baltimore '68: Riots and Rebirth in an American City. She says decades of systemic discrimination laid the groundwork for the 1968 and 2015 riots. Things like city-instituted segregation and then redlining that prevented many black people from getting home loans to move or repair their existing houses. Police in riot gear advance on the crowd in Baltimore following riots that broke out after the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015. David Goldman/AP ""There are these scars through certain neighborhoods and people feel like their neighborhoods have been abandoned. Abandoned by the federal government, abandoned by the local government, abandoned by wealthier neighbors who have moved out,"" Nix says. ""So you can see, just in the residential sector, there's a lot of frustration."" Nix says King was scheduled to visit Baltimore a week before he was killed. At the time he was expanding his fight against segregation to address economic disparities — for all races. Commemorations of Martin Luther King's passing will continue in Baltimore through April. Next week young activists are sitting down with veterans of the civil rights movement to talk about how to fulfill King's dream.",Riots in Baltimore broke out days after Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder.

George Dvorsky,"In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee. Alarmingly, winds are expected to pick up in the coming days, making a bad situation potentially worse. The latest California wildfire started in early Monday evening in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, spreading quickly to more than 15 square miles in just a few hours. The fires, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions, are devouring vegetation that hasn’t burned in decades, according to fire officials. To date, around 10,000 people have had to flee their homes. It’s a destructive and dangerous climax to what has been a devastating wildfire season in the state. As of late yesterday, the blaze had burned over 100 square miles in areas just north of Los Angeles and east of Santa Barbara. Currently, there are five active major blazes. Some 150 structures have burned down, including the 82-bed Vista del Mar Hospital in northwestern Ventura. Officials say the number of homes damaged by the wildfires is likely much higher. The wildfire is also causing mass power outages and water disruptions. Around 43,000 homes are currently without power (with more expected), and the Casitas Municipal Water District has advised residents of the city of Ventura, Upper Ojai Valley, Casitas Springs, and Foster Park to boil their tap water for about a minute before drinking and cooking. Without power, some water pumping systems and fire hydrants are inoperable, complicating matters for fire crews. The largest of the five wildfires, the Thomas Fire, has reached and skipped across the 101 freeway just north of Ventura, burning through oil fields, and reaching the Pacific Ocean. This fire is moving extremely quickly, torching an acre per second. As of Tuesday, the Thomas Fire has spanned 50,000 acres, and is listed as “zero percent contained” by fire officials. No fatalities have been reported to date, but three firefighters in LA were hurt and taken to a hospital where they’re listed in stable condition. “This is life in Southern California. This is where we live,” Mark Gennaro, who’s home of 12 years was destroyed, told The Washington Post. “I stand on that back hill and I see all that brush and I’m like, ‘Something’s gonna happen at some point.’” About 150,000 people in LA have been affected by evacuation orders for the Creek Fire near Sylmar and Lake View Terrace. Curfews have been enacted in the city of Ventura from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. In Ventura, more than a quarter of its 100,000 residents have been told to evacuate. And it’s not over yet. After a brief respite late yesterday, the Santa Ana winds are expected to pick up today and tomorrow, gusting as fast as 35 to 50 mph, according to National Weather Service. This will likely fuel the fires even further, and possibly start new fires as it blows embers and ash elsewhere. The dry Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure in the Great Basin and lower pressure off the coast. In the previous two years, rains have arrived prior to this stage in the wildfire season, but the region hasn’t seen any rain in the past three months. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared state of emergency for Ventura County, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said “We expect to be out here all week fighting and containing this fire,” Some 1,100 personnel are currently battling the wildfires. “We’ve been watching all these disasters on TV, you really don’t think about when it happens to you, and what do you pack in that moment?,” said Ventura resident Samantha Wells-Zuniga on KABC news. “Now, everything that I have, except for my lovely family, is gone.” Beginning Monday night, dry conditions combined with the most intense Santa Ana wind event of the… Read more Read [ CNN, LA Times, Washington Post ]","In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A Colorado wildfire nearly doubled in size from Saturday to Sunday and prompted hundreds more evacuations as dry and windy conditions were expected to persist, officials said. The so-called 416 Fire in southwest Colorado had burned nearly 17,000 acres by Sunday morning, an area larger than Manhattan. The fire located north of Durango was 10 percent contained, the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team said. The fire had burned about 9,000 acres by early on Saturday, according to an aerial survey. A mandatory evacuation order was issued on Sunday for approximately 675 residences, bringing the total number of homes under evacuation to almost 2,000, La Plata County, Colorado, spokeswoman Megan Graham said. Law enforcement officials are going door to door and residents have been warned to leave via calls to their phones, text message and emails, Graham said. Low humidity and high winds have left firefighters bracing for the fire to spread and the weather was expected to be dry and windy on Sunday. Images on social media showed large plumes of smoke disseminating above mountains against a backdrop of blue sky. A blaze known as the Burro fire prompted U.S. Forest Service officials on Saturday to close part of the Colorado trail in the San Juan National Forest. In addition, an air quality health advisory was extended on Sunday due to unhealthy levels of smoke, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. In 2017, a near-record 10 million acres (4 million hectares) were burned in U.S. wildfires, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The same agency issued a June forecast for “above-normal significant large fire potential” in Southern California and the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, because of a deepening drought and ample fuel for wildfires.

No matter how long it takes, at some point your big move will start to feel less like an exciting life change and more like the daily grind. That’s when you’ll start thinking about everyone you left behind—your friends, your family, your favorite taco truck with the guy who knew your order—and start asking yourself why you haven’t made as many new friends as you hoped you would. Why none of the tacos taste as good as the ones back home. Why you’re still thinking of the place you came from as home, and whether you made the wrong decision to move. When you move somewhere new, it often feels like a chance to rewrite your life. A new home, with new furniture. Maybe a new job. A whole new group of people to meet, at new restaurants.

If you’re the youngest/oldest person at the book club, for example, it’s probably not the right book club for you. If you moved with a partner or a family, it’s still worthwhile to find an activity that’s just for you—but you should also look for an activity that you can do together, whether it’s a cooking class or a community garden. Sometimes it’s easier to make friends as a team! Spend more money on local businesses If you miss the days when you were a regular at a restaurant or bar (or local bookstore or yarn store), it’s time to find a new favorite establishment.

Major news events like Hurricane Harvey produce thousands of photos, and thousands more tweets and

See, Der Postillon published a joke article that teens in Berlin are wearing scarves around their ankles, to stay warm while wearing fashionably short pants. Then the Italian satire site Lercio syndicated that article. Lercio isnt pretending to be real any more than Der Postillon is; the front page includes stories about a hermit hiding inside his mailbox, and the pope fighting over parking spots for the Popemobile. 
When a blogger for the American site BestProducts.comnot a satire sitepicked up the ankle scarf story, she either failed to notice that it was satire, or decided that it would make a better story if she didnt mention that part. She linked to an $11 kids scarf that could, in a pinch, double as an ankle warmer and copied the photoshopped picture from Lercio. On BestProducts.com, the photo ran with the caption, We may earn a commission for purchases made through our links. Why trust us?
The better-known outlet Country Living then syndicated this post word-for-word. The blog for radio station mix 105.1 also aggregated the story. Both publications tweeted the story with incredulous captions.
For the story to get this far, multiple people had to ignore some obvious warning signs. The BestProducts.com blogger might not have looked at any other page on Lercio, the satire site. But she still linked to the source, which means everyone who spread the story failed to check to see that the source was satirical. They also had to ignore the fake-looking picture of ankle scarves as they copy-pasted it onto their own sites. But no one has time for that. And theres plenty of motivation to not check, when youre having so much fun mocking fictional people for wearing fictional ankle scarves.
Over the past year, all (well, at least most) of us have gotten a little more skeptical about what

In his essential essay False Witnesses 2, Fred Clark refers to the Anti Kitten-Burning Coalition. This is the group of people who, upon hearing the terrible news that someone has burned a kitten, speak out bravely to inform the world that they, personally, are against kitten burning. This accomplishes nothing, since almost everyone is against kitten burning, and that didnt stop the kitten burners. It only gives the speaker a false sense of moral superiority. And if no ones actually burned a kitten lately, the Anti Kitten-Burning Coalition tends to make up a few cases they can get mad at. 
What you see with the ankle socks trend is the much more innocent version of this. The internet finds a target we can all agree on, and suddenly it doesnt really matter if the target actually exists. In this case, instead of a heinous crime, its a fashion crimean acceptable target that stands in for everything we hate hipsters and millennials for doing. (Hipster hate is often code for homophobia and misogyny, so its not entirely innocent, but on the grand spectrum, this is Laurel/Yanny, not Pizzagate.) We all get to feel superior to those fictional trend worshippers buying scarves for their ankles.
And because feeling superior feels so good, we hate to get called out on it. Just try to point out the truth to someone in those Twitter threads making fun of ankle scarves. Theres a good chance theyll yell at you, say thats not the point, the point is those frickin Brooklyn hipsters!!! Theyll defend their bit of fun and they will not like you coming in and trying to make them feel foolish.
But dont laugh at themunless every time you come across a news story, youre ready to click through to the source. Lets be honest; you dont have time for that. Some day, itll be you who falls for the hoax.","Ankle scarves! What a ridiculous trend!

Aqilah Allaudeen,"The vigil started as an inside joke but gained attention on social media. Twitter/itsmelissabrown Fans held a candlelight vigil for a Taco Bell that burned down in Montgomery, Alabama. Around 100 people were present for the event. The vigil was originally supposed to be a joke among the organizer's friends, but it gained a wider audience after going viral. After a Taco Bell outlet in Montgomery, Alabama, burned down last week, fans of the chain's Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco Supremes, soft tacos, and other staples came together for a candlelight vigil. The event took place on January 21 and saw some 100 people gathered across the road from where the Taco Bell once stood. Those who showed up went all out. Just look at how they were dressed: And many more who couldn't make it down for the event posted their support for the vigil on the event's Facebook page. Here’s what some of them had to say: Facebook/Madison Clark Facebook/Mary Harrell Facebook/Ashton McNabb Of course, the Facebook page for the event, which called for people to ""never forget the okay customer service and long wait line for the oh so delightful baja blasts and 5 dollar quesadilla box,"" has since gone viral. Katie James, the creator of the group, told Montgomery Advertiser that the event was just supposed to be a ""joke"" with her friends (and her roommate, who's a fast food lover), but it caught the public's eye and turned out to be something more. ""It just gave people something to talk about other than all the negativity that's going on right now,"" she added. The irony of it all? She says that she hasn't eaten at Taco Bell in years, as she is a bodybuilder. In a statement, the owners of the outlet said that they were "" overwhelmed by the displays of support"" and are ""already planning our comeback,"" reported WSFA 12 News.","Twitter/itsmelissabrown Fans held a candlelight vigil for a Taco Bell that burned down in Montgomery, Alabama.

Associated Press,"(WORCESTER, Mass.) — Four Massachusetts residents have been charged with keeping a 16-year-old girl in a basement that a police officer described as a “torture chamber.” Police say the teenager was sexually assaulted, had her hair shaved off and was burned with a cigarette. The suspects are charged with kidnapping and other offenses. They appeared in a hearing Wednesday to determine whether they can be held without bail. Prosecutors say the suspects held the girl in an Auburn home because they thought she knew who was responsible for a Dec. 27 home invasion. Prosecutors say she was duct-taped to a chair and had a machete held against her throat. Defendant Krystal Lugo was held without bail. Her attorney said she was not a danger. The hearings for three male defendants will continue until Friday.",She had been duct taped to a chair and burned with cigarettes,2018-01-05T16:02:44Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","16-Year-Old Girl Was Sexually Assaulted in a ‘Torture Chamber,’ Police Say",http://time.com/5089658/auburn-massachusetts-girl-kidnapped/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/manhattan-suicide-building-explosion-attempt.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,burned,1
Benjamin Goggin,"Three wildfires raged through California on Friday, destroying thousands of structures and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their towns. In northern California, the Camp Fire, reportedly named by local officials, almost completely destroyed the community of Paradise, fire captain Scott McLean told the Associated Press. The fires reportedly started after windy conditions swept through the state, creating high fire danger. On Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Butte County for the northernmost Camp Fire, which is expected to burn for multiple days. He also requested federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a letter to President Donald Trump asking for a presidential emergency declaration. On Friday, mandatory evacuation orders for the Malibu and Santa Monica areas affected by the Woolsey Fire were issued. Malibu Search and Rescue tweeted, ""Do not wait!""
